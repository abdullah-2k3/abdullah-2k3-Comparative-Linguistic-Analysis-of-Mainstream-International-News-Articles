The current campaign may be the most tumultuous in US history, with a late-in-the-day candidate change and two dramatic debates, along with the possibility (again) of the first woman president. But the race for the White House has intrigued film-makers for decades, with some startling results. Even Frank Capra, the goody-two-shoes of US cinema, cast a sceptical eye on the process. Some films are thinly veiled fictions, others prescient fantasies, but all find themes that go the heart of US democracy and ideals. Here are some of the best presidential election movies, including an under-appreciated gem from Mike Nichols and Elaine May, another starring Ryan Gosling and George Clooney, and a West Wing warm-up from Aaron Sorkin.  One of Mike Nichols' best and least-known films, with a glittering screenplay by Elaine May, this satire follows a not-at-all veiled fictional version of Bill Clinton through the primaries on his way to the White House. John Travolta is unlikely but brilliant as Jack Stanton, a Southern governor who can charm his way out of anything. Travolta captures the Clinton charisma as well as the empathetic ""I feel your pain"" glances without becoming a caricature. Emma Thompson plays his wife, Susan, a Hillary before she had a political career of her own, but whose instincts are as sharp as anyone's. Based on the 1996 novel by the journalist Joe Klein (originally published as Anonymous), the film goes behind the scenes as the campaign tries to dispel rumours – some true, some not – of Stanton's womanising. Adrian Lester, as an idealistic young campaign manager, embodies the theme of lost innocence that runs through so many movies about US elections. The film is also very funny even as it raises one of the fundamental questions of 20th and 21st-Century politics: does a little spin and subterfuge matter if it helps put someone who'll do the best for the US in the White House? Even Lincoln stretched the truth, Stanton argues. One of the great films of our time, All the President's Men is of course front-and-centre about journalism. But take another look as you'll see how much it is also about dirty campaign politics. When Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, as Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, ­track down the truth behind the Watergate break-in and the cover-up that led to Richard Nixon's resignation, much of their investigation leads them to CREEP, the all-too-accurate acronym for the Republicans' Committee to Re-elect the President. That committee's bungled attempt to steal information from the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building was just the first clue to exposing all sorts of other campaign creepiness from illegal payments to character assassination. Still suspenseful every time you watch it, the film beautifully weaves together many threads about the US. The corruption behind Nixon's 1972 campaign is one of its themes with enduring, cautionary impact. This satire from the 1990s seems timelier than ever now, in the age of artificial intelligence and disputes about what constitutes a fact. Robert De Niro is at his droll best as Conrad Brean, a campaign consultant called in when a story about the president's affair with a young woman breaks two weeks before the election that will keep him in office. (One jaw-dropping aside: the film was released just a month before the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal broke. The Clinton presidency really was a gift to film-makers.) To save the campaign, Brean recruits a Hollywood producer – hilariously played as the ultimate narcissist by Dustin Hoffman – to film evidence of a war with Albania that doesn't really exist. They even find a war hero who wasn't a hero and make him a celebrity. The press buys it, the public buys it and who's to say what's real anymore? The film's portrayal of how politics and Hollywood merge is taken for granted now, but David Mamet's biting screenplay and Barry Levinson's sharp direction hold up perfectly. DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus's groundbreaking documentary is based on amazing behind-the-scenes access to Bill Clinton's first run for president in 1992, and stands as the real-life version of Primary Colors. Clinton appears only briefly. The central characters are the strategist James Carville and the communications director, a baby-faced George Stephanopoulos, long before he became a news anchor. A sign on the wall of the campaign office gives us Carville's now famous line about what mattered most: ""The Economy. Stupid."" Stephanopoulos is seen putting out media fires, including a phone conversation in which he tells a reporter working on a rumour about Clinton that he will look foolish and have no future if he writes that lie, almost making that response sound like a fact not a threat. (That particular rumour has, in fact, long since been discredited.) The film is exhilarating as it captures all the youthful energy of a campaign running on hope and adrenaline. Gore Vidal's screenplay is firmly in the JFK era, but its take on the machinations to choose a presidential nominee at a split convention still goes to the heart of many issues in campaign politics, including money, promises made in exchange for support and skeletons in the candidates' closets. Henry Fonda plays William Russell, the experienced secretary of state, fondly called an egghead by one of his supporters. ""Do you think people mistrust intellectuals like you in politics?"" one reporter asks him. Senator Joe Cantwell (Cliff Robertson, who the year before played Kennedy as a war hero in the hagiographic PT-109) is his slick, young, ends-justifies-the means rival. Each candidate has dirt on the other, but will they use it? Vidal takes a jab at the era's homophobia by making one of the secrets the rumour of a gay affair, and complicates the issue when it turns out that one of the rumours is false. The noble ending seems forced, but until then the film remains full of intrigue and soul-searching questions. This strong but little-known Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn drama was directed by Frank Capra, and its sharp-eyed cynicism about the political process makes it one of his least corny films. Tracy plays Grant Matthews, a successful businessman married to Mary (Hepburn) but involved in an affair with a politically ambitious newspaper heiress, Kay Thorndyke, played by Angela Lansbury. Kay wants to use her money and influence to put Grant in the White House, but they'll need Mary to play along as the loyal spouse. Hepburn captures Mary's hurt and disappointment when she realises she's being used as a campaign prop (the spouse as prop is one of the most intractable aspects of running for office). Tracy makes Grant an essentially good man who for a time is co-opted by ambition and political handlers. Like any Capra film, this one an idealistic ending, but its true interest for us today is its clarity about the seductiveness of power and the compromises that go into electing a president. If you love The West Wing but wish it were more of a romcom, this is the film for you. Before creating his series, Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay for this Rob Reiner politics-tinged romance about Andrew Shepherd, charmingly played by Michael Douglas, a widowed president and single father running for re-election. When he falls for an environmental lobbyist, Sydney Ellen Wade, played with equal charm by Annette Bening, his advisors tell him to keep her out of the public eye and his rivals start attacking her. Martin Sheen, before he was President Bartlett on The West Wing, plays Shepherd's chief of staff and best friend, and there is a hint of the television series in the wrangling to get votes for Shepherd's crime bill to pass through Congress, along with the question of whether he will jeopardise his re-election by supporting an environmental bill. But the most characteristic Sorkin element is the rosy idealism about the possibility of politics to do some good, an idea that makes this a buoyant outlier among more typical, sceptical 1990s political movies. This dynamic film starring Ryan Gosling and George Clooney, who also directed, didn't make much of an impact when it was released, possibly because its story, with a whiff of the Clinton sex scandals, might have seemed tired during the Obama years. Seen now, it smartly taps into the persistent theme of lost political innocence, with Gosling as Stephen Meyers, a young but savvy campaign strategist, who goes to work for Mike Morris (Clooney) a politically gifted governor running for president. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Stephen's jaded boss and Paul Giamatti is the manager of a rival campaign in a cast that includes Jeffrey Wright and Marisa Tomei. Evan Rachel Wood plays a young Morris intern, and the very mention of that role is enough to hint that you know where the plot is heading. But the gamesmanship among the candidates, and between the campaigns and the press, is so smart and well-played that the predictability hardly matters. You might laugh to keep from crying at this fact-based film about how John McCain's campaign chose Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his 2008 running mate, a cynical, haphazard move that backfired in every possible way. Jay Roach's comedy-of-errors stays close to reality, based on the reported book by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, and at times edits actual reporters and politicians into scenes with the actors. Woody Harrelson plays Steve Schmidt, the strategist who insists that McCain (Ed Harris) has to do something game-changing, like choosing a woman, to have a chance of beating Obama. With time running out, and little vetting, they choose the inexperienced but telegenic Palin. Julianne Moore brings Palin to life with remarkable verisimilitude as she captures her odd inflections of language, and with some sympathy for how far she is out of her depth. She is so clueless about foreign affairs, and for that matter foreign countries, that Nicolle Wallace (Sarah Paulson), the director of communications who is trying to guide her through, just gives up. Sobering yet still a romp, this film might be the only silver lining in the whole Palin debacle. The Obama presidency was just a gleam in America's eye when Chris Rock wrote, directed and starred in this comedy as Mays Gilliam, a lowly local politician in Washington, DC who is recruited by the Democrats to run for president when their candidate dies shortly before the election. It's all a ruse: the party politicians want to get credit for running a black candidate, who is sure to lose, while keeping the spot open for one of their own insiders next term. The joke is on them, of course. Mays is a straight-talking guy, in touch with working people and willing to tell them the no-nonsense truth about everything, pointing to inequities and getting crowds to chant, ""That ain't right!""  Rock's stand-up comedy is often satiric, but this film is more broadly comic – Bernie Mac plays Mays' loud, brash brother – and more earnest. It echoes the question raised way back in 1948 by State of the Union: can a truth-teller win? Head of State doesn't entirely work. It's distracting when the rapper Nate Dog pops in and out of the film with musical narration. But it is breezy and fun, so ignore that 30 per cent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Back when the very idea of a woman president was preposterous, Betty Boop ran. The cartoon vamp campaigned with a song in this six-and-a-half-minute animated comedy, with promises of ice cream and shared wealth. ""Some of you have money / While some are poor, you know,"" she sings. ""If you send me to Washington / I'll just divide the dough."" She imagines herself in front of a split Congress, the elephants on one side and the donkeys on the other disagreeing on everything. The short is a delightful little oddity, but honestly, there have been worse candidates. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj98grr5lo,Can illegal immigrants really vote in the US election?,It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in the US election - but Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed immigrants are going to.,2 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Democrats are planning to get illegal immigrants to vote in the US election.  “Our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,” Trump said during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris. BBC Verify has identified more than 100 paid-for ads on Facebook and Instagram posted by Republicans since the start of September focusing on the issue. It is illegal for a non-US citizen to vote in a national election, but studies suggest cases of this actually happening are very rare.  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 prohibits non-citizens - which includes illegal immigrants - from voting in federal elections. The punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation. Every state is required to use a common registration form which requires people to confirm they are US citizens, under penalty of perjury for false claims, but does not require documentary proof. “That first step of having to tick a box saying you’re a citizen to register to vote is a huge deterrent for illegal immigrants, as it’s hugely risky to lie,” says Jasleen Singh, a voting expert at the liberal policy think tank Brennan Center for Justice. In many states, voter rolls are cross-referenced with citizenship and immigration services, death certificates, and postal records to make sure that people who are non-citizens, dead, or live out of state are not registered to vote. “At the polls, there’s a list of eligible voters, and if a non-citizen turns up, they’ll be turned away or told to cast a provisional ballot which will only be accepted if they can provide proof of citizenship,” says Prof Ronald Hayduk, a voting rights expert at San Francisco State University. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in state-wide elections either.  However, some municipalities in California, Maryland, Vermont and Washington DC do allow them to vote in certain local elections, such as for school boards.   A number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of illegal immigrants voting in US federal elections are very rare. One by the Brennan Center for Justice interviewed 44 election officials who worked across 12 states during the 2016 election. It found that out of 23.5 million votes counted in these states, an estimated 30 suspected incidents of non-citizens voting were referred for further investigation. That’s about 0.0001% of all votes cast.  An analysis of a database which collected election fraud cases between 1999 and 2023 by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, found 77 instances of non-citizens voting. A number of other reports, including by the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, entitled ‘Non-citizens Don’t Illegally Vote in Detectable Numbers’, come to similar conclusions.  ""According to many sources of evidence, the number of non-citizens who vote in elections is very small,"" says Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who's written a number of reports on voter fraud. ""It's not zero, some people slip through the cracks for various reasons, but it's nowhere near at the level to impact the outcome of an election."" The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a Republican proposal which would require people to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, has been rejected in the House of Representatives. Republican lawmakers continue to push for more citizenship requirements. “We have a number of states who have done audits of their voter rolls and found thousands of non-citizens,” the lead Republican in the House, Mike Johnson, told CNN. He highlighted Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia - three states where polls show a tight race between Trump and Kamala Harris. In Ohio, a review called for by Republican officials in the state, found that out of about eight million registered voters, there were 597 cases which have been referred for “further review and potential prosecution” for non-citizens registering to vote. In Pennsylvania, a glitch with electronic touchscreens in state drivers' licence centres wrongly showed non-citizens the option to register to vote while getting new or updated licences. This glitch was in the system between 2006 and 2017, and has since been resolved. In 2017, Pennsylvania state election officials said non-citizen immigrants might have cast 544 ballots illegally out of more than 93 million ballots in elections dating back to 2000. In Georgia, a review of voter rolls in 2022 found 1,634 people “had attempted to register to vote” but “were not able to be verified”, out of about seven million registered voters. “Voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting is so rare that this myth is to sow doubt in election integrity and lay the groundwork to cast doubt on the election outcome,” argues Ms Singh. BBC Verify has identified 118 paid-for ads posted on Facebook and Instagram since 1 September by Republican candidates or by Republican political groups which claim widespread voter registration of non-citizens, or which raise the question of whether non-citizens should be allowed to vote in elections. The ads we identified were shown between 7.8 and nine million times on the platforms.  One - which had more than 2.4 million views - invites users to participate in a poll with the question: ""Should illegal immigrants be allowed to vote?"" Another ad posted by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, with more than 900,000 views, invites users to answer the same question. Additional reporting by Maryam Ahmed.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7x0pj5xzdo,Afghan man arrested in alleged US election day attack plot,The man allegedly plotted to carry out an attack in the US on behalf of the Islamic State,6 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US Department of Justice has arrested a man who allegedly planned an attack on Election Day in the name of the Islamic State group. The suspect, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, is a citizen of Afghanistan residing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, according to prosecutors. “This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement on Tuesday. The FBI said he was attempting stockpile firearms, and had taken steps to liquidate his family's assets and relocate members overseas.  Mr Tawhedi is charged with providing, attempting to provide, and conspiracy to provide support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization; and with trying to procure firearms and ammunition to use to commit a felony or act of terrorism. The FBI said Mr Tawhedi worked with an unnamed co-conspirator, who is a juvenile relative and also a citizen of Afghanistan. It accuses him of consuming Islamic State propaganda via the internet, based on Google records obtained by law enforcement, and donating to a charity used as a front for IS. “We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America’s national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people,'' said Attorney General Merrick Garland. According to the BBC news partner CBS, federal investigators' affidavit alleges that Mr Tawhedi searched for surveillance cameras in Washington, and webcams showing the White House and Washington Monument. It also alleges that he researched states with more lax gun laws.  Mr Tawhedi sought AK-47 assault rifles to use in the attack, authorities claim. On 7 October, he and the co-conspirator met with individuals who actually worked undercover for the FBI to purchase the weapons and ammunition.  After the purchase, Mr Tawhedi and his co-conspirator were arrested. In an interview conducted after his arrest on Monday, the FBI said Mr Tawhedi allegedly confirmed he planned an Election Day attack that would target “large gatherings of people” and that he planned to die carrying it out. Mr Tawhedi arrived in the US in September 2021 on a special immigrant visa with his wife and young child. He lived in Oklahoma City at the time of his arrest. It is not immediately clear if he has legal representation."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zpy3zj7ro,Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election,People in Beijing tell the BBC's Laura Bicker their hopes and fears about who will win the White House race.,18 hrs ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House. “None of us wants to see a war,” says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner. He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors.  They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China. In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds. It comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high. “I am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,” says Mr Xiang who’s in his sixties. Peace is what we want, he adds. A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble. They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election. “Although he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine’s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,” he said. Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. “Donald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,” says one.  “About Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.” Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media. China has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its “Arab brothers” in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel. On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a “constructive role” as he accused Washington of “exploiting the situation for selfish gain”. While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country’s leaders. But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan. “I don’t like Trump. I don’t think there is a good future between the US and China – there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,” says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out. He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict. “I don’t want it. I don’t want my son to go to the military,” he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi has said “reunification is inevitable”, vowing to retake it by force if necessary. The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a “commitment to security and prosperity for all nations.” Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection. “Taiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They’re immensely wealthy,” he said in a recent interview. “Taiwan should pay us for defence.” One of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn. Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump.  President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electronic vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.  “I don’t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,” says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people. Many of the the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power too. In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship. “Our country is a very prosperous and powerful country,” they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America. Taylor Swift is on their playlists too. Others like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day. As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation. Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. “Harris’s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it’s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.” The People’s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that makes up the most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800. Xi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously. He said that on dozens of occasions the security forces or a government ministry have prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US. On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials. Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China. “We may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,” she says as she heads off to join her family.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0ze01r2zdo,First in-person votes cast in US presidential election,"Virginia is the first state to allow early in-person voting, a milestone moment six weeks before election day.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The first in-person votes have been cast in the US presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, a milestone moment that comes six weeks before election day on 5 November. Virginia became the first state in the country to allow in-person voting on Friday, and early polling sites will remain open there until 2 November. Some long queues were seen as voters cast ballots on national, state and local levels. The situation in two other states, Minnesota and South Dakota, is different as voters there can only hand in absentee ballots in person instead of mailing them. “Why not try to be first? That’s kind of fun, right?” one voter in Minnesota, Jason Miller, told the Associated Press. Some 69% of votes cast during the 2020 election were done through early in-person voting or through mail-in ballots, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's election data science lab found.  Some in a queue in Fairfax, Virginia, told the BBC they felt it was their civic duty to vote early. “You never know if you’ll be hit by a bus,"" one voter said on Friday, adding that they wanted to be “safe not sorry"". Another said the good weather - and a day working from home - had prompted them to cast their early ballot. Virginia has been a reliably Democratic state in the last few elections, but some Republicans have been bullish about trying to flip it in November. Voters there will also be casting votes for the state’s eleven members of congress and one of its two senators. Early and mail-in voting has been a hot-button issue since the 2020 election, with just 37% of Republicans saying people should have the option to vote early, according to polling from the Pew Research Center. That sharply contrasts with 82% support from Democrats. The latest polling suggests the presidential race is extremely tight, with Harris holding a slight national lead. In the months leading up to President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race, polls consistently indicated he was trailing Trump. But the race tightened when Harris became the Democratic candidate. Along with the presidential race, millions of voters in 41 states will also have the chance to voice their opinion on a specific policy position by voting on ballot initiatives on 5 November. Ten states are asking voters to decide whether they want to enshrine abortion access in their states' constitutions, voters in West Virginia will be asked vote on whether or not medically assisted suicide should be prohibited, and voters in three states will be asked whether recreational marijuana usage for adults should be legal.  There are more than 140 measures on the ballot across the US, according to a count from the Associated Press. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70w49w6pk2o,Suspicious packages sent to election officials across US,"Colorado's secretary of state says the poster of the letters called themselves the ""US Traitor Elimination Army"".",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service are investigating suspicious packages received by election officials in 17 states. Federal investigators said they were collecting the packages and that some contained ""an unknown substance"", though there were no reports of injuries. They were sent to secretaries of state and state election officials across a swathe of the country from New York to Alaska. It comes amid reports of rising threats directed at election officials across the US and warnings of political violence as November's presidential election approaches. The FBI and postal service said they were trying to determine how many letters were sent and who was behind them, as well as their motive. “Some of the letters contained an unknown substance and we are working closely with our law enforcement partners to respond to each incident and safely collect the letters,” the agencies said in a statement to BBC’s US partner CBS News. The Associated Press news agency reported that packages were sent to election officials in Alaska, Georgia, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Rhode Island, Iowa, Mississippi, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that whoever posted the letters had called themselves as the “US Traitor Elimination Army”. Officials in at least four of the states said there was no threat posed by the substances found in the packages. In Oklahoma, the Board of Elections said the substance was found to be flour. In an interview with CBS, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said her office was receiving threats daily through voicemails, emails, social media or in person, adding that “it’s escalating”. This is not the first time suspicious mail was mailed to US election offices. Last November, offices in Georgia, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington were sent envelopes with fentanyl or other substances. Federal investigators are separately questioning a gunman who was found lurking in bushes on a Florida golf course where Trump was putting on Sunday.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20np62x88o,What insults tell us about the Trump-Harris election fight,Nine quotes reveal how the candidates talk about each other - and how the political messages have evolved.,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The tone of the 2024 presidential race is in the spotlight after Republican nominee Donald Trump was targeted in what the FBI called another apparent assassination attempt. He and his running mate, JD Vance, have blamed their Democratic opponents for what they characterise as their inflammatory language. The Republican candidates and their supporters have also received criticism from Democrats for their rhetoric.  The finger-pointing has led to increased scrutiny of the language and insults used by both campaigns about the other side. Each has an active and aggressive social media presence that reaches millions of Americans, and frequently paints their opponents in derogatory terms. Trump utilises his Truth Social account to make - or promote - some of the most vitriolic attacks on Democrats. In the end, however, the candidates are most responsible for their own spoken words. Here are nine quotes from interviews, speeches and campaign events this year that help illustrate how the political messages on both sides have – and have not – shifted over time. Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead? In what was billed as his first general election campaign address, Trump spoke to a rally crowd in Georgia for nearly two hours in March. He offered the kind of intensely personal attacks that have been a staple of his speeches since he launched his first presidential bid in 2016. In an apocalyptic speech littered with personal insults about President Joe Biden, including mocking his stutter, he said the surge of migrants across the southern border would lead to the plunder of US cities and the violation of its people. Biden began his presidency promising national unity, with a concerted effort not to focus on or even talk about “the former guy”, as he put it.  But as it became increasingly obvious that Trump would be the 2024 Republican nominee — with a very real chance to win back the White House — the president changed his rhetorical tune. He delivered a series of speeches warning of an existential threat to the nation if Trump returned to power. After his disastrous debate performance three months ago - and as he battled to save his campaign - Biden told donors on a private call “it’s time to put Trump in a bullseye”. Days later, after Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally, the president called his choice of words “a mistake” but rejected Republican claims he had incited violence. The day after Trump narrowly avoided serious injury during an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, he told the Washington Examiner that he planned to strike a new tone in his Republican National Convention speech in Wisconsin later that week.  Riding high over Biden in public opinion polls, it appeared the path to the White House was clearing for the former president. A convention speech that started with a recollection of the assassination attempt and some calls for unity, however, devolved quickly into a more typical and freewheeling Trump speech dwelling on perceived grievances. The dynamics of the 2024 presidential campaign shifted yet again shortly after the Republican convention, when Biden abandoned his re-election bid and Vice-President Kamala Harris stepped in, promising a different, “joyful” message. Her first rally speech as a candidate was not devoid of attacks against the former president, but the dire warnings about democracy at risk were absent. Trump’s new tone lasted all of six days after his convention speech, as he went on the attack against Harris at a rally in North Carolina. He called her “a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country” and a “danger to democracy”. Accusing the Democrats of weaponising the justice system against him, he said every criminal indictment was a badge of honour. As the presidential contest heated up, the attacks from the Democratic ticket sharpened. In her own nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Harris mentioned Trump 17 times, criticising his conduct during the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, his policies on abortion and tax cuts, his foreign policy stances and his criminal record. She asked America to remember the ""chaos and calamity"" of the Trump years.  At their first and probably only debate in Philadelphia, Harris and Trump exchanged swipes and barbs. As he often does, Trump tried to turn the “threat to democracy” line that Biden had used against him into an attack on Harris. He called her a “radical left liberal” and a Marxist who was destroying America. He said she would be remembered as “the worst vice-president in the history of our country”. Harris spent much of her time during the debate goading Trump into angry off-topic responses. She belittled the size of his rally crowds, quoted his Republican critics and mocked the size of his inheritance.  Then, as Trump fumed, she said that the American people want to move beyond “finger-pointing”. It’s the kind of strategy that fits with a voting public that says they want their candidates to take the high ground – but then responds the most to negative messages. A second apparent assassination attempt - this time at his golf course in Florida -did not prompt Trump to return to his unity message. With polls showing the presidential race in a virtual dead heat with a little more than six weeks remaining, Trump has opted instead to attack his Democratic opponents for what he says is dangerous rhetoric – while attacking them with similar language."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylwy33ewxo,Trump-Harris debate sums up policy-light US election,"We learned little new from both sides on policy, a theme in a campaign that has been focused largely on character.",12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris entered Tuesday’s night’s presidential debate with a clear plan: dominate and destabilise Donald Trump. It started with her opening power move, when she strode across the compact stage in Philadelphia to demand a handshake. This was her seizing the initiative, and a telling sign that America’s surprise presidential candidate was keen to exert control on an opponent who has a track record of dominating these kind of stages. In the hours since this blockbuster showdown, political pundits and networks have dedicated much time to praising and analysing Harris’s approach. Her poking and her prodding of Trump. Her mocking, derisory laughter as she ribbed him with personal attacks and then watched as he lost his cool and pushed back angrily. The scale and tone of this coverage is largely due to the fact her strategy was successful. The few instant polls we saw after the debate indicated a resounding victory for Harris. And while the history of US elections shows this does not always translate to a victory in November, it was surprising to see Harris take on Trump in this aggressive way. But, however successful this approach was, it is ultimately surface-level stuff. It is body language and facial expressions and sharp ripostes. Before this event, polls consistently suggested voters wanted to know more about where Harris stood on the key issues. Her campaign so far has been light, even vague, on hard policy. And while Trump is more well-established, voters are surely still keen to know what he would do in real terms if elected again. So, did the debate tell us much about what either of them would do in office? Not particularly. Harris did come with prepared soundbites explaining her economic proposals that she has outlined before – a $6,000 child tax credit for infants, a $50,000 tax cut for small businesses and $25,000 to help first time home buyers find a deposit. She argued that Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported goods would cause higher prices for consumers. These are all things we have heard several times previously from the campaign. Harris did not give an answer when quizzed on why the Biden administration, which she has served in for almost four years, has kept in place a number of tariffs introduced by Trump. Nor did she describe how she would try to tackle inflation which consistently polls as a top concern for many voters. But Trump’s attempt to capitalise on this clear and obvious weakness for Harris (he described his rival’s economic policies as Marxist) got lost as he veered into an answer about illegal migrants, saying “bad immigration” is the worst thing that can happen to the economy. This exchange was illustrative of the night as a whole. There was no shortage of heat in this ill-tempered debate, but both sides shone very little light on policy. The Trump campaign is eager to paint Harris as a radical left-winger by reminding voters that she has previously said she would ban fracking, nationalise health insurance and decriminalise illegal border crossings. Asked directly why so many of her policy positions have changed, Harris said she would discuss every point raised – but in reality explained only why she voted for new fracking leases to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Once again, a flustered Trump failed to capitalise on her policy flip flops being raised directly. These were easy opportunities to sell himself as consistent on policy in comparison. He could have rammed home his positions on the key issues as well as tout policy achievements from his first term. Instead, viewers saw the former president on the defensive, distracted by barbs from Harris which he could have chosen to ignore. It was immigration that he returned to again and again. His signature issue which he believes is more salient now than ever. Yet, even on such comfortable ground. he could not describe how he would go about trying to deport millions of illegal migrants. There was more familiar noise but still little in the way of hard proposals. This debate was the first chance voters had to see the two candidates going head to head. They could compare demeanour, temperament and body language. But crucially they didn’t get much to compare on their plans for government. One moment on Tuesday night felt particularly indicative of this. For nine years, Trump has been saying he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) but had to admit that he has not produced a plan for what could replace it. “I have the concepts of a plan” was his response. And after the 90-minute primetime showdown, voters were likely only left with “the concepts” of what either of these candidates would do if elected to the White House."

The US Secret Service said the decision to treat the procedure at the Capitol as a ""national special security event"" was made after they received numerous calls from politicians, including Washington's mayor. The agency said the classification will allow for ""significant resources"" at local, state and federal levels and a ""comprehensive security plan"". This will be the first time lawmakers confirm election results since the US Capitol riot, when supporters of former President Donald Trump violently breached the complex on 6 January 2021. Trump is again running for president in a close race against Vice-President Kamala Harris. His running mate, JD Vance, recently said that if he had been US vice-president in 2021 he would not have certified the election results.  An attempt to assassinate Trump in July has also stoked security fears surrounding the election. Events that have had the high-level security designation in the past include presidential inaugurations, the UN General Assembly, Nato summits and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Utah.  The first Super Bowl after the 9/11 attacks, which was held in New Orleans in February 2002, was given the same designation.  The Secret Service said on Wednesday they had received multiple requests for upgraded security, including from members of a House of Representatives committee that investigated the Capitol riot. In Tuesday's presidential debate, Trump blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser for the riot, saying Bowser had turned down his offer to have the National Guard at the Capitol that day.  Bowser, however, has said the president never made the offer and that as president, he had controlled the troops. Meanwhile, US Attorney General Merrick Garland condemned ""an escalation of attacks"" against the justice department in a speech on Thursday.  America's top law official pushed back on ""conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods…and threats of actual violence"" that endanger the department's employees. The justice department has faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats for its handling of various politically charged investigations into both Trump and Biden.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4x71znwxdo,US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?,An in-depth look at the polls and what they can and can’t tell us about who will win the White House.,11 hrs ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Voters in the US go to the polls on 5 November to elect their next president. The election was initially a rematch of 2020 but it was upended in July when President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris.  The big question now is - will America get its first woman president or a second Donald Trump term? As election day approaches, we'll be keeping track of the polls and seeing what effect the campaign has on the race for the White House. Harris has had a small lead over Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race at the end of July and she remains ahead - as shown in the chart below with the latest figures rounded to the nearest whole number. Harris saw a bounce in her polling numbers in the first few weeks of her campaign, building a lead of nearly four percentage points towards the end of August. But the numbers have been relatively stable since early September, even after the only debate between the two candidates on 10 September, which was watched by nearly 70 million people. You can see how little the race has changed nationally in the last few weeks in the poll tracker chart below, with the trend lines showing the averages and the dots showing the individual poll results for each candidate. While these national polls are a useful guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, they're not necessarily an accurate way to predict the result of the election. That's because the US uses an electoral college system, in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line with the size of its population. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win. There are 50 states in the US but because most of them nearly always vote for the same party, in reality there are just a handful where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states or swing states. Right now the polls are very tight in the seven states considered battlegrounds in this election and neither candidate has a decisive lead in any of them, according to the polling averages. If you look at the trends since Harris joined the race, it does help highlight some differences between the states - but it’s important to note that there are fewer state polls than national polls so we have less data to go on and every poll has a margin of error that means the numbers could be higher or lower. In Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, the lead has changed hands a few times since the start of August but Trump has had a small lead for a few weeks now. It’s a similar story in Nevada but with Harris the candidate who is slightly ahead at the moment. In the three other states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - Harris has been leading since the start of August, sometimes by two or three points, but in recent days the polls have tightened significantly. All three of those states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016. Biden retook them in 2020 and if Harris can do the same then she will be on course to win the election. In a sign of how the race has changed since Harris became the Democratic nominee, on the day that Biden quit the race he was trailing Trump by nearly five percentage points on average in the seven swing states. In Pennsylvania, Biden was behind by nearly 4.5 percentage points when he dropped out, as the chart below shows. It is a key state for both campaigns as it has the highest number of electoral votes of the seven and therefore winning it makes it easier to reach the 270 votes needed. The figures we have used in the graphics above are averages created by polling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News. To create them, 538 collects the data from individual polls carried out both nationally and in battleground states by lots of polling companies. As part of its quality control, 538 only includes polls from companies that meet certain criteria, like being transparent about how many people they polled, when the poll was carried out and how the poll was conducted (telephone calls, text message, online, etc). You can read more about the 538 methodology here. At the moment, the polls suggest that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are within a couple of percentage points of each other in swing states - and when the race is that close, it’s very hard to predict winners. Polls underestimated support for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. Polling companies will be trying to fix that problem in a number of ways, including how to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. Those adjustments are difficult to get right and pollsters still have to make educated guesses about other factors like who will actually turn up to vote on 5 November.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj9ekdvxx2o,Trump says he will not run again if he loses election,For the second time in a week the Republican presidential candidate has acknowledged the prospect of defeat.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former President Donald Trump has said he does not expect to run for election again in 2028 if he is defeated in this November's US presidential poll. Trump, 78, has been the Republican candidate for three national elections in a row and has reshaped the party greatly over the last eight years.  In an interview with Sinclair Media Group, he was asked if he could foresee another run in the event that he loses to Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris. ""No, I don't. I think... that will be it,"" Trump said. ""I don't see that at all.""  But he added that ""hopefully, we're going to be very successful"".  US law bars presidents from serving more than two terms, and so Trump is not expected to run in 2028 if he wins, either. In the past, the real estate mogul has rarely acknowledged the possibility of losing the election, more often firing up supporters with speeches and social media posts pledging victory at the polls. But this is the second time in four days he has mentioned a chance of defeat. During an event held by the Israeli-American Council on Thursday, he brought up losing, and suggested that any such loss would partly be the fault of Jewish voters.  ""Do they know what the hell is happening if I don't win this election?"" he said, according to various media reports. ""And the Jewish people would have to do a lot with that if that happens because at 40% [support] that means 60% of the people are voting for the enemy."" The comments were condemned by the Harris campaign and by the nonpartisan American Jewish Committee and Anti-Defamation League.  Trump's acknowledgments of a possible loss may reflect how the Democratic Party's prospects have changed since Harris became its nominee following President Joe Biden's decision to quit the race. Her campaign raised more than $190m (£142m) in August, compared to $130m brought in by the Trump campaign and affiliated organisations. In national polling averages tracked by the BBC she is ahead of Trump,  and a poll released on Sunday by CBS indicated she leads Trump 52% to 48% nationally.  In key US battleground states which look set to prove decisive to the overall result, Harris has a narrower lead of 51% to 49%, which is a slight improvement from the even 50% in a similar poll conducted last month by CBS, the BBC's news partner.  Another poll released on Sunday by NBC indicated Harris had a five percentage point lead over Trump across the US. It also found that 48% of registered voters see her positively compared to 32% in July - the largest jump since then-President George W Bush's favourability surged after the 11 September 2001 attacks. But like other surveys, the NBC poll suggested Trump held a clear advantage with voters on some of the election's biggest issues, including the economy, the cost of living and immigration. The BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment on the polling data.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkdzyy6vz4o,'Chilling' abuse for politicians during election,Physical abuse and stalking are just some of the instances reported to the BBC.,8 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Intimidation, stalking and harassment were some of the forms of abuse faced by politicians ahead of this year's elections. In a questionnaire carried out by the BBC, MPs and councillors spoke about ""being chased"" while out campaigning, people ""taking pictures"" outside their house and verbal abuse at hustings.  The questionnaire was handed out to councillors elected in May's local elections in Bristol City, Swindon, Gloucester, Cheltenham and Stroud. It was also given to MPs and second-placed candidates. Barbara Clark, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Cheltenham, had abusive messages left on her answerphone because her campaign leaflets supported the Covid vaccine rollout. ""He threatened me, and it was chilling. I've never been spoken to like that in my life before,"" Ms Clark said. Some of the anonymous responses of the types of abuse unearthed by the BBC questionnaire included: Ms Clark reported the threats made to her to Gloucestershire Police and a restraining order was put in place.  Cheltenham Borough Council has also invested in extra security because of threatening behaviour during council meetings. ""We'd be foolish as a council not to have considered how we keep our staff, our councillors but also the people attending the hearing safe,"" said councillor Dr David Willingham. During the local elections, Swindon Conservative councillor Daniel Adams said he had people taking photos outside his house. ""I think in hindsight I should have gone to the police,"" Mr Adams said. ""My wife was quite annoyed I didn't tell her."" Labour MP for Stroud Dr Simon Opher said he was ""delighted"" to be elected in July, winning the largest majority since 1992, and the largest majority ever for a Labour MP. The night after the election, the team came back to a smashed window at his office, after a brick was thrown at it. ""It didn't really upset me that much,"" Dr Opher said. ""It was just a bit of a stark reminder that politics is potentially dangerous."" The incident was reported to the police. The Jo Cox foundation, formed after the murder of the Labour MP in 2016, said this is a common experience for politicians across the country. ""[We want] politicians to model civil behaviour themselves, so it's up to all of us,"" said Civility Commission Manager Hannah Phillips. ""We want robust debate with respect,"" she added. The foundation has urged candidates standing in elections to take the Civility Pledge and share their commitment to a respectful election campaign, as just one way to champion a fairer politics. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is setting up a new committee which will consider threat levels against candidates and MPs, and recommend ways to address them.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl013w4e8o,'It's non-stop': Swing state voters bombarded with ads - will they make a difference?,Record sums are being spent on advertising in the US election - but will that make a difference?,5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Like many Americans, Hayden Cook decided long ago who to vote for in this year's presidential election.  And yet, every day, the 19-year-old from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania is bombarded with political ads, despite installing a blocker on YouTube and opting out of cable television.  ""It's still so constant,"" Cook said. ""Work is six minutes away - you're already hearing two or three ads; then we have the radio on at work and there's ads there."" More than $10bn (£7.6bn) is expected to be spent on political advertising this election. That is up some 20-25% from 2020 - itself a record-setting cycle - depending on which forecaster is consulted.  Most of that money will be funnelled through a handful of critical, highly competitive states that are expected to decide the election, with almost $1bn going towards one state alone: Pennsylvania.  The Keystone State is expected to attract $935m in ad spending this election, including $450m on the presidential contest between former President Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris, according to research firm AdImpact.  And that does not include all the free media coverage the candidates have received as they repeatedly return to the state on the campaign trail.  Cook, a political junkie, doesn't mind the barrage - but has been bemused by some of it.  At one point, the family home was getting multiple mailers each day from a conservative group, despite everyone being a registered Democrat.  ""It's absolutely non-stop,"" Cook said. ""It's everywhere."" In the UK, election campaigns are limited to 25 working days, spending is capped, and political advertising on radio and television is banned. So the frenzy in the US can seem nonsensical - especially in a contest where so many voters like Cook have already made up their minds about the candidates.  Polling this year has suggested only a tiny fraction of voters - about 3%, much smaller than in historic elections - are undecided. But surveys also indicate Trump and Harris are locked in a dead heat while even some decided voters are expressing dissatisfaction and uncertainty, raising the possibility of an election-day surprise.  ""Advertising in presidential races typically matters only at the margins - it doesn't matter very much - but if the margin is in play, it matters a lot to the overall outcome,"" said Erika Fowler, professor of government at Wesleyan University and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project.  If election success were determined by dollars alone, Harris could be declared the winner now.  Her campaign - and that of Joe Biden before he quit the race - has been significantly out-fundraising and out-spending her Republican rival's.  At the start of September, it had $235m in the bank, almost twice as much as Trump's $135m.  Her campaign spent roughly $135m on media product and ad buys the month prior, which amounted to nearly 80% of $174m in total expenditures in August, the most recent official figures available, according to federal filings. That was more than double the roughly $57m the Trump campaign spent on advertising and mailers the same month, and his overall $61m in spending was also far lower. But elections are about more than a bottom line. In the 2016 and 2020 election, Trump was also outspent but he dominated the headlines, giving him free coverage that helped to narrow the gap, Prof Fowler said.   This year, since Harris became the nominee, she has appeared to close Trump's lead with free press, while the Democrats' spending advantage has continued to widen, according to Prof Fowler. Over some weeks in September, Harris had been outspending Trump on Facebook and Instagram by a factor of 16:1.  ""I have never seen margins like that before,"" Prof Fowler said.  When you factor in spending by outside groups, the gap between Trump and Harris narrows. But Geoff Pereira, head of content and insights at Media Radar CMAC, which tracks advertising on traditional television and radio, said Trump may be gambling, based on past experience and tight polls, that commercials won't be the deciding factor. After all, pro-Trump groups backed by some of his wealthiest supporters, such as Elon Musk's America PAC, have claimed they plan to steer their spending to other areas, such as turnout. ""He was outspent in 2016 and 2020 and he's being outspent to a greater extent this cycle, at least so far,"" Mr Pereira said. ""Will it matter?"" ""Reading between the lines, he thinks he doesn't necessarily need it."" Advertising by a candidate has been found to help boost turnout by supporters, said Cameron Shelton, a professor of political economy at Claremont McKenna College. That makes it potentially important in states like Pennsylvania, where polls suggest margins will be slim. But unless it is targeted, the messages can also backfire, Prof Shelton warned.  His research on the 2012 and 2016 elections found that political ads were as likely to propel opponents to the polls in anger as they were to bring in supporters. ""Ads don't persuade,"" he said. ""What happens is the ad just pushes you towards your preconceptions. It polarises, it enflames."" ""If you get a balanced audience, it looks like you're increasing the other side's votes just as much as your own,"" he said.  Harris's Facebook page is currently running more than 300 ads targeting voters in Pennsylvania, compared with 22 on Trump's page, many of them pitched to younger audiences and women, a BBC Verify analysis found.  But mass advertising on traditional television - which tends to reach a population of older, more reliable voters - continues to account for the majority of spending for both campaigns.  Over the summer, campaign ads focused on issues important to each candidates' base: immigration for Trump and healthcare and abortion for Harris.  But in more recent weeks, the economy - an issue of importance to voters in both camps and one in which Trump and Republicans have historically held the advantage - has gained focus, Prof Fowler said.  In Pennsylvania, Trump has attacked Harris over fracking, an advanced oil and gas drilling technique which she previously supported banning. Fracking plays a key role in the state, which is the second biggest producer of natural gas in the US. Harris has spotlighted adverts aimed at traditional Republicans and rural voters, in which former Trump voters and farmers argue that he worked only for the wealthy.  All the ads can make for awkward moments in politically diverse company, said Tim Anzelone, a 36-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who recently hosted a watch party to celebrate the start of the season for his NFL team, the Steelers. Worried about political ads spurring arguments among his guests, he strategised ahead of time to mute the television during every commercial break.  The plan worked, he said: ""People didn't pay attention... I would guess 50% of the ads were presidential [election-related] and nobody talked about it."" He said he was ready for the election to be over, having already made up his mind about the race - a private decision he declined to share.  ""The ads definitely don't sway me at all,"" he said. ""I always do think it's a huge waste of money but it must be working for someone."" In future elections, Prof Shelton said he expected targeting to become much more precise, reducing the risk of backlash and uncomfortable party dynamics - but also likely pushing America further apart.  ""My sad projection would be then we're going to get even more siloed and polarised,"" he said. ""I'm going to see a certain set of ads that make me believe one thing and you're going to see a certain set of ads that make you believe another."" Additional reporting by Maryam Ahmed, BBC Verify"

Tina Peters, a Republican, was convicted last August on most counts against her in the election interference case. Peters, 68, helped breach Mesa County's election computer systems and allowed an unauthorised individual to access voting equipment and election records. She carried out the breach amid unsubstantiated claims that mass voter fraud had caused former President Donald Trump to lose the White House in the last presidential election. State District Court Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters on Thursday: “You are no hero.  ""You’re a charlatan who used and is still using your prior position in office to peddle a snake oil that’s been proven to be junk time and time again."" He sentenced her to eight-and-a-half years in the Colorado Department of Corrections and additional time in the Mesa County Detention Center.  Peters pleaded not guilty to all charges in 2022, but a jury convicted her on seven of the 10 counts. Those included three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.  ""Tina Peters has been sentenced to nine years of incarceration for her dangerous attempts to break into her own election equipment to prove Trump's 'Big Lie',"" Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement. ""We will not allow anyone to threaten our elections.""  The case marked the first time a local election official was prosecuted over a security beach in the 2020 election. Peters became ""fixated"" on voting problems after the presidential election, prosecutors said. Investigators also issued a search warrant for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a proponent of election fraud claims, in connection to Peters' case, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v6jgj8q8vo,A quick guide to swing state Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.,4 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Pennsylvania, famous for the Liberty Bell, Will Smith and the 72 “Rocky Steps”, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election. Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can lean Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close. Here’s all you need to know. 12.97m, same as Moscow 19 of 538 It’s hard to win the White House without Pennsylvania, which carries the most electoral votes of all the swing states. Biden by 82,000 votes.  Pennsylvania’s prized 19 electoral votes make it one of the most visited states by both candidates. It is also the place where a supporter of Trump was killed at a rally, in what police say was the attempted assassination of the former president. In Morrisville, eastern Pennsylvania, Stephen Connolly says swing state voters like himself are ""exhausted"" from the political campaigning targeting them. “The majority of voters, they already know who they’re going to vote for,” the registered Democrat explains. South of Pittsburgh, Republican Andy Jones, 50, says it’s “kind of cool” to be at the forefront of voting every year. “It puts us on the map,” he says. A retired Marine, he says he is concerned about the economy and border security and plans to support Trump. Only about 3% of voters in the state identify as undecided, according to an August 2024 Emerson College Polling/The Hill swing state survey. The same survey suggests Republicans and Democrats are split at 48%. ""Pennsylvania is a coin flip at this point,” says Dan Mallison, associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State University. “It's going to be very close again most likely.” The state went to Democrats for the last 20 years before Trump won in 2016. The southeastern part, which includes Philadelphia and its suburban counties, are key for Democrats to gather enough votes to win. Pennsylvania’s mix of urban and rural populations make it a competitive state for both presidential candidates, says Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. ""It's not overwhelmingly leaning to one of the two parties, either Republican or Democrat,"" he explains. ""That makes it particularly coveted.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8705wv99ryo,Harris and Trump gamble $200m on biggest prize,The Keystone State is the lynchpin of the swing-state electoral firewalls for both campaigns.,5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The White House’s address may be 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but the real road to the presidency runs through the state of Pennsylvania, the biggest prize among the electoral battleground map. According to calculations by elections analyst Nate Silver, the candidate who wins Pennsylvania has more than a 90% chance of winning the White House. “It’s the granddaddy of all the swing states,” said former congressman Patrick Murphy, who represented north-eastern Pennsylvania as a Democrat from 2007-11. With its 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania – the fifth most populous US state - is the lynchpin of the swing-state electoral firewalls for both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. If the Democrats win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, along with one congressional district in Nebraska, she’s the next president. If the Republicans carry Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, Trump is back in the White House next year. Without Pennsylvania, there is no way Trump can win without flipping at least three of the states Joe Biden won in 2020. Nicknamed the Keystone State, Pennsylvania could in fact be the key to the White House. It is also where BBC Question Time will broadcast a US election special on Thursday 10 October, diving into the issues and voter concerns behind the presidential contest. Pennsylvania is not only the most valuable swing state, it also can be seen as a microcosm of the US as a whole – demographically, economically and politically. It is a former manufacturing state that has been transitioning to newer industries and businesses, but it has a large energy sector because of its abundant oil shale deposits. Agriculture is still the second-largest industry in the state. The majority of the population is white, but there are growing immigrant communities. Some areas, like Allentown – the working-class factory city made famous by a Billy Joel song – are now majority Hispanic. The state’s black population, at 12%, is just under the US total of 13%. As for the politics, the state’s two large urban areas, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, heavily favour the Democrats. Between the two are vast stretches of rural territory where Republicans dominate. And the suburbs that once were reliably conservative are now tilting to the left. That gives rise to the old quip that Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with (deeply Republican) Alabama in the middle. Somehow, all these political cross-currents and shifting dynamics have kept Pennsylvania at a near dead-even balance when it comes to presidential elections. President Joe Biden won the state by about 80,000 votes in 2020. Donald Trump carried it by about 40,000 in his surprise 2016 win over Hillary Clinton. Only once in the last 40 years has a candidate won Pennsylvania by double-digits - Barack Obama in his 2008 electoral landslide. Current polling puts the race between Harris and Trump in the state at a virtual dead heat. According to the 538/ABC News poll tracker, Harris holds a lead by less than a percent – a margin that has hardly shifted over the course of this tumultuous political year. Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have been pouring enormous resources into Pennsylvania. They are spending more on television advertising there than any other swing state. Both candidates make regular visits. Harris introduced her running mate pick, Tim Walz, at a rally in Philadelphia. She spent days preparing for her presidential debate in Pittsburgh. She made a tentpole economic speech there two weeks ago. Last Saturday, Trump held a massive rally in Butler, where in July he was nearly assassinated. On Wednesday he was in Biden's hometown of Scranton and Reading. And when the principals aren’t around, both campaigns have other politicians and officials to drum up support. “A candidate can't go into a county to talk to 1,200 people,” says former Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell. “The state is too big. There’s just not time. That’s what surrogates are for.” Rendell notes that the current governor, Democrat Josh Shapiro, is a big help for Democrats here, as he is very popular in the state and a dynamic speaker – qualities that had made him the odds-on favourite to be Harris’s vice-presidential pick. For Harris, her keys to victory are to post dominating numbers in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and win the suburbs by enough to offset Trump’s margins in the rest of the state. An essential part of this strategy is to win over moderate voters and some Republicans – including the more than 160,000 who turned out to vote for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the state’s Republican primary, held earlier this year, well after Trump had already locked up the party’s nomination. “What these people need to hear is ways in which both the past record of Kamala Harris and the future plans of Kamala Harris are basically centrist positions – that she is not this crazy, wild-eyed radical leftist,” said Craig Snyder, former Republican Senate staffer who is running Pennsylvania's “Haley Voters for Harris” effort. He added that the Harris campaign is making the most extensive effort to reach Republican voters that he’s seen in a generation. Trump’s strategy is to squeeze all the support he can out of the conservative parts of the state, including by registering and mobilising those who may not have participated in past elections – a move Trump’s campaign officials say is a central focus of their grass-roots effort. There are signs their work may be paying off, too. Registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the state, but the margin is just a few hundred thousand - the smallest its been since the state first began releasing figures in 1998. While the college-educated voters in the suburbs may be difficult to convince, the Trump team thinks it can also chip away at traditionally Democratic support among blue-collar union voters and young black men. “We've seen nationally that Trump has made some real inroads with African American men,” said Farah Jimenez, a conservative education activist. “They're here in Philadelphia, and if you can convince them that he speaks more clearly to the things that concern them, it can at least start to provide a base for Republicans in Philadelphia.” Four years ago, the results in Pennsylvania took days to come in – due, in large part, to the more than two million mail-in ballots cast because of the Covid pandemic. Major media outlets didn’t project Biden as the winner until four days after the election. Mail-in voting is expected to be lower this year, but the state reports that it has already received 217,000 completed ballots that, by Pennsylvania law, cannot be opened and tabulated until election night. Another wildcard is the more than 27,000 military and overseas voter ballots that have been distributed by Pennsylvania state officials so far. If the race is as close as polls indicate, those votes could make a difference – even if they take longer to arrive and be recorded. “I can't imagine that it's not going to take several days after to get a count,” said Snyder. “And if the count is very close, we're going to get into lawsuits and recounts and all the rest of it. So everybody needs to buckle up.” North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qv1nw302ro,Fresh faces in Mozambique's poll as independence era leaders bow out,A watershed poll will see a shift at the top with a new era of post-colonial leaders vying for power.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Mozambique is set for a watershed election that will see a change of the presidential guard, with the era of leaders who forged their careers in the trenches of the independence war against Portuguese rule coming to an end. For the first time, the once all-powerful Frelimo party is fielding a presidential candidate who was born after independence - the charismatic 47-year-old Daniel Chapo, who it hopes will rally voters fed up with its 49-year rule. “In some places Frelimo campaign members have been booed and openly rejected,” political commentator Charles Mangwiro tells the BBC. Mozambique - strategically located along the southern African coast and rich in natural resources, but hit by an insurgency in the remote north - will hold presidential elections on Wednesday, along with parliamentary and gubernatorial elections. President Filipe Nyusi is stepping down at the end of his two terms and hopes to hand the reigns of power to Chapo. His government had to deal with the fallout of the ""tuna bond"" corruption scandal - which triggered the country's worst economic crisis. In comparison, Chapo is a breath of fresh air - and draws big crowds at rallies across the country as he distances himself from the corruption that has plagued Frelimo for much of its rule since independence in 1975. ""Brother Dan is honesty in person... He is the voice of hope we want to embrace... It's time for change,"" say the lyrics of one of his campaign songs. But human rights activist and journalist Mirna Chitsungo says she doubts whether Chapo can convince all voters that he can change Frelimo. ""If we have a degraded country, it is because of corruption. He faces the challenge of promising to fight this evil while belonging to a party that, on a large scale, has perpetuated corruption,"" she told the BBC. Counting in Chapo's favour is the fact that he is a relative newcomer in the political arena, having joined government only in 2011 as a district administrator, rising by 2019 to become governor of the southern Inhambane province until taking over as general secretary of Frelimo in May. But his critics say that to ensure victory, Frelimo has a back-up plan: fraud. A leading non-governmental organisation in Mozambique, Centro de Integridade Pública, says its research showed that around 5% of the names on the voters' roll are fake, or so-called ""ghost voters"" - that is a figure of nearly 900,000. “The simple fact is that data published by the CNE [Central National Elections Commission] itself shows that 878,868 more voters were registered than there are voting age adults in some provinces, and thus these are ghost voters on the voters roll,” Mozambique analyst Joe Hanlon told the BBC. Miguel de Brito, from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, notes that the ""ghost voters"" are not evenly distributed across the country - only seven key provinces out of 10 have registered more voters than people. For instance, one-third of all the people registered in Gaza Province, which usually votes overwhelmingly for Frelimo, are thought to be ""ghost voters"". It is also the area where large numbers of people leave every year for work in South Africa. “It’s gotten worse, this year we managed to register nationally almost 105% of the voting age population,” Mr De Brito told the BBC. Both the election commission and Frelimo deny any foul play, insisting that the elections will be free and fair. Chapo is facing a challenge from three other candidates: Of the three, Mondlane is the fresh face, vying for the presidency for the first time after breaking away from Renamo. With the slogan ""Save Mozambique - this country is ours"", the 50-year-old is proving to be a big hit, especially in the campaign to win the youth vote. ""He [Mondlane] uses this slogan everywhere and he tries to explain to young voters that they should take pride in being Mozambican because conditions are there for them not to be poor or unemployed,"" Mangwiro explains. ""He draws large numbers at his campaign rallies and people are not frog-marched to attend - come rain, cold or sun.” A former banker, Mondlane first made his mark when he ran for mayor of the capital, Maputo, in local elections last year. Many people believed that he won - alleging the result was then rigged in favour of Frelimo's candidate. Mondlane fought that election under the banner of Renamo, but quit the party after Momade, 60, refused to make way for him to take over. Momade became Renamo's leader following the death of its long-time leader Afonso Dhlakama in 2018. He is widely credited for signing a peace deal with Nyusi to end a civil war that had raged between Renamo fighters and government forces. Momade ran for the presidency in elections in 2019, and claimed that he was robbed of victory by Nyusi, but remained committed to the peace deal. Though he is confident of winning this time, his chances have been hampered by Mondlane's entry into the race - a point that Chitsungo, the human rights activist, made when she said that Mondlane is seen by many Renamo voters as a ""young man with the spirit of Dhlakama"". ""It is as if we are having elections with a resurrected Dhlakama, a rejuvenated Dhlakama. So, we have this novelty,"" she pointed out. Chapo is hoping that the Renamo vote will be split between the two men, improving his chances of clinching victory. In a sign of his determination to win, Chapo has travelled to next-door neighbour South Africa to raise funds for his campaign, hosting a banquet in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg. He also addressed ordinary Mozambicans in the city, urging them to cast their ballots for him at the embassy where they were able to register to vote earlier in the year. ""This is a candidacy for renewal,"" he told the crowd. ""This is a unique opportunity I have to make a difference, almost 50 years after independence.” Mondlane also took his campaign to Johannesburg, visiting a fresh-produce market that Mozambicans run in the city. “I’ll sort out the problems that led you to abandon Mozambique,” he said. The violence in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, which has witnessed jihadist attacks since 2017 that have halted the lucrative liquefied natural gas projects there, has not been a major election issue. Rwandan and South Africans troops, deployed several years ago to deal with the insurgents, are still on the ground for now - though Ziyanda Stuurman, from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, says there has been an “uptick in the frequency and severity of insurgent attacks since January”. Most analysts agree the biggest challenge for any new president will be creating economic opportunities and jobs in a country where 62% of the population live in extreme poverty, on less than $1.90 (£1.45) a day. But the election race is still wide open, with candidates and parties holding their final campaign rallies on Sunday. Refusing to bet on who will win on Wednesday, Mangwiro, the political analyst, says: ""It's too close to call."" Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwylnl02em1o,Why Georgia could again be centre of an election storm,A new Republican rule requiring a hand count of ballots turns the state election board into a political lightning rod.,26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It was no ordinary meeting of Georgia’s once-staid election board. The state panel gathered on Monday for its second all-day meeting to discuss new election rules, hurling accusations at one another while its nonpartisan chairman banged his mallet, calling for order. The five members had gathered to discuss last week’s 3-2 vote to approve a rule that requires counties to hand count ballots on and after election night. In recent months, the panel’s new Republican members have approved changes that have sparked warnings this pivotal battleground state could once again find itself at the centre of confusion on and after Election Day. After narrowly losing Georgia in 2020, Donald Trump and his allies filed lawsuits and spread unfounded allegations of election fraud, with Trump at one point pressuring Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find 11,780 votes"" - the margin he lost by in the Peach State.  Trump is currently fighting state criminal charges of conspiring to overturn that defeat in Georgia. Since then, the drama has continued to play out at the state election board level, with Democratic member Sarah Tindall Ghazal accusing her Republican colleagues of being motivated by ""far right-wing beliefs"".  On Monday, Republican member Janice Johnston hit back against the criticism, claiming her character was being ""assassinat[ed]"". Last Friday’s vote on the hand counting of ballots in Georgia came after weeks of objection from local election officials. Poll supervisors in Georgia told the BBC the new rule could cause problems on and after Election Day, including delays in results reporting and human errors. The new measure requires poll workers to hand count ballots on election night - or in some cases, the day after - to confirm that the number of paper ballots matches the amount tabulated by the machine. Janelle King, a Republican who voted in favour of the rule, told the BBC the measure aims to ensure the accuracy of election results. She noted that the rule does not require poll workers to count the actual results on the ballots, only the amount of papers. “Our voters - I think they care more about accuracy than speed,” she said. “It’s the best practice.” Other election officials disagreed. “It’s a recipe for disaster,” Anne Dover, a Republican elections director in Georgia’s Cherokee County, told the BBC. Dover says the new election rules are being pushed by those who fear the 2020 election was fraudulent. She says her own husband has questioned the results of the election four years ago in other parts of the state. “They’re just not in touch with how hard elections officials work to do a good job,” she said. Ethan Compton, an elections supervisor in Irwin County, Georgia, says the new rule will slow down results reporting and ""leave room for chaos, and chaos can sow seeds of doubt"".  Compton worries that the aftermath of the election in Georgia in 2024 could mirror the events of four years ago, when Trump and his allies cited hours of absentee-ballot counting as evidence of voter fraud, undermining public confidence in the election process. This isn’t the first change of voting rules to spark uproar in an election year. Democrats triggered lawsuits four years ago after they broadened use of ballot drop boxes in Wisconsin and expanded postal voting in Pennsylvania. But the difference in Georgia is that criticism is coming from both sides of the political aisle. Georgia’s State Election Board comprises three Republicans, one Democrat and a chairman appointed by the Republican governor. The role was historically procedural and nonpartisan, but in the aftermath of the 2020 election, the panels have emerged as a political lightning rod. “Now, the job has turned into something that's like partisan football,” said Gowri Ramachandran, director of elections and security at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal non-profit. The state board was previously chaired by Georgia’s secretary of state, but Raffensperger's fellow Republicans pushed him out after the 2020 election, a move critics say was revenge for his defence of the election results. Since then, several Trump-aligned Republicans have joined and won a majority on the board: Ms King, Ms Johnston and former Republican state senator Rick Jeffares. During meetings, the board’s three new Republican members have advocated for a number of changes to the state’s elections, including a rule passed earlier this year that allows local election boards to conduct “reasonable inquiries” into election results before certifying them. Ms King argues the rule will lead to “an increase in certifications” because board members can examine documents themselves. “We want to make sure they have as much confidence in that election as possible,” she said. Trump has personally thanked Ms King and her two newly appointed Republican board members by name, saying at a rally in Atlanta in August that the trio were “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory”. Officials and election administration experts said that although the state board’s rule changes could bring disruption in November, they believed Georgia’s broader voting laws would ultimately pave the way for a secure presidential election. Some also said they remained concerned about the damage that could be done to the public’s trust in the election system. Dover said the misinformation that circulated during the last election led to bomb threats and voicemails harassing election officials. Peter Simmons, a Georgia policy strategist with the non-profit Protect Democracy, which describes itself as nonpartisan, noted that even though Trump’s allegations of widespread fraud in 2020 have never been substantiated, a large portion of Americans still believe his claims. “That's essentially what has inspired this set of actions [in Georgia] today,” Mr Simmons said.

Peterborough First has 14 councillors, the Conservative Party has 11, the Liberal Democrat Party has eight, the Green Party has five and there are four  Independent councillors.  Peterborough First held a meeting last night and voted unanimously to elect Farooq as group leader. His predecessor Harper announced two weeks ago he was stepping down as leader of the group. In a statement Farooq said he was ""honoured"" at his election. He added that the council was ""in the toughest financial position we have ever seen"". ""We will hold to account the administration and the council for the bad decisions and equally support and enable the good decisions."" In November Farooq took on the role as city council leader after a vote of no confidence in his predecessor, the Conservative leader Wayne Fitzgerald.

The consultation has been launched by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which said it wanted to ensure each councillor represented the same number of people and better reflected community identities. The proposals, which include reducing the number of North Yorkshire councillors, could be put in place by the next local elections in 2027. Richard Flinton, North Yorkshire Council's chief executive, said it was ""vital that our residents take part in this consultation"". A Local Government Boundary Commission for England spokesperson said: ""By telling us about where you live and where you access local services, it will help us to create appropriate and meaningful boundaries. ""It might be something as straightforward as where you go for shops, schools or a sporting venue, whether you see a road, park or river as a dividing feature or the heart of a community, or which areas have joint projects. "" When North Yorkshire Council was created in 2023, the commission decided there should be 90 councillors, but it has since proposed this should be reduced to 89. However, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, there have been concerns from some councillors about their workloads - particularly when compared to the smaller wards on the former borough councils which were merged as part of last year's changes. Mr Flinton said: “It is vital our residents take part in this consultation so the new division boundaries reflect their views. ""When North Yorkshire Council was created last year, we set out to create the most 'local' local authority, and we are committed to making sure every community is fairly represented and has a voice through their councillors.""  The Local Government Boundary Commission for England consultation will run for 10 weeks and is due to close on 9 December. A further round of consultation is expected to get under way in April next year, once the commission has drawn up its proposals.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vkdp3rx17o,US ports strike causes first shutdown in 50 years,"The strike is set to significantly disrupt trade, creating uncertainty ahead of the US election.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Tens of thousands of dockworkers have gone on strike indefinitely at ports across much of the US, threatening significant trade and economic disruption ahead of the presidential election and the busy holiday shopping season. Members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) walked out on Tuesday at 14 major ports along the east and gulf coasts, halting container traffic from Maine to Texas. The action marks the first such shutdown in almost 50 years. President Joe Biden has the power to suspend the strike for 80 days for further negotiations, but the White House has said he is not planning to act. Talks have been stalled for months and the current contract between parties expired on Monday. The White House said that President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were monitoring the strike closely. ""The President has directed his team to convey his message directly to both sides that they need to be at the table and negotiating in good faith - fairly and quickly."" The two sides are fighting over a six-year master contract that covers about 25,000 port workers employed in container and roll-on/roll-off operations, according to the US Maritime Alliance, known as USMX, which represents shipping firms, port associations and marine terminal operators. On Monday, USMX said it had increased its offer, which would raise wages by almost 50%, triple employers' contributions to pension plans and strengthen health care options. Union boss Harold Daggett has called for significant pay increases for his members, while voicing concerns about threats from automation. USMX has accused the union of refusing to bargain, filing a complaint with labour regulators that asked them to order the union back to the table. Under the previous contract, starting wages ranged from $20 to $39 per hour, depending on a worker's experience. Workers also receive other benefits, such as bonuses connected to container trade.  Mr Daggett has indicated the union wants to see per-hour pay increase by five dollars per year over the life of the six-year deal, which he estimated amounted to about 10% per year.  The ILA said workers are owed after shipping firm profits soared during the Covid pandemic, while inflation hit salaries. It has warned to expect a wider strike of its members, including those not directly involved in this dispute, though the exact numbers are unclear. The union has said it represents more than 85,000 people; it claimed about 47,000 active members in its annual report to the Labor Department.  Time-sensitive imports, such as food, are likely to be among the goods first impacted. The ports involved handle about 14% of agricultural exports shipped by sea and more than half of imports, including a significant share of trade in bananas and chocolate, according to the Farm Bureau. Other sectors exposed to disruption include tin, tobacco and nicotine, Oxford Economics said. Clothing and footwear firms, and European carmakers, which route many of their shipments through the Port of Baltimore, will also take a hit. Imports in the US surged over the summer, as many businesses took steps to rush shipments ahead of the strike. ""I don't think we will see immediate, significant economic impacts...but over the course of weeks, if the strike lasts that long, we can begin to see prices rise and for there to be some shortages in goods,"" said Seth Harris, a professor at Northeastern University and a former White House adviser on labour issues. More than a third of exports and imports could be affected by the strike, hitting US economic growth to the tune of at least $4.5bn each week of the strike, according to Grace Zemmer, an associate US economist at Oxford Economics, though others have estimated the economic hit could be higher. She said more than 100,000 people could find themselves temporarily out of work as the impact of the stoppage spreads. ""This is really a trigger event, one that will see dominoes fall over the coming months,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at ocean freight analytics firm Xeneta, warning that the stand-off also has the potential push up wider shipping costs. That would hit consumers and businesses which tend to rely on so-called ""just-in-time"" supply chains for goods, he added. The stand-off marks the first time since 1977 that the ILA has gone on strike and injects uncertainty into the US economy at a delicate time. The economy has been slower and the unemployment rate is ticking higher as the US election approaches in six weeks. The strike risks putting President Biden in a tricky spot.  US presidents can intervene in labour disputes that threaten national security or safety by imposing an 80-day cooling-off period, forcing workers back on the job while negotiations continue. In 2002, Republican President George W Bush intervened to open ports after 11 days of a strike action by dockworkers on the west coast, who are represented by a different union. The US Chamber of Commerce business group has called on President Biden to take action. ""Americans experienced the pain of delays and shortages of goods during the pandemic-era supply chain backlogs in 2021. It would be unconscionable to allow a contract dispute to inflict such a shock to our economy,"" said Suzanne P. Clark, president and chief executive of the business group. The ILA's Mr Daggett endorsed Democrat Biden in 2020, but has been critical of the president more recently, citing pressure on west coast dockworkers to reach a deal a year ago. He met with Donald Trump last year. Although any strike chaos is likely to hurt Democrats, the cost of alienating allies in the labour movement just weeks before the election would be greater, said William Brucher, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. But public support of strikes could be tested by the dispute, which has been championed by Mr Daggett, who was acquitted of having links to organised crime in a 2004 case by federal prosecutors. A related civil suit remains unresolved.   Films such as the 1954 classic crime drama On the Waterfront, starring Marlon Brando, once defined the union's image, but Prof Brucher said he thought that historical memory had largely faded and many people shared the dockworkers' concerns about cost-of living and automation. ""As much as it could sway public opinion against the ILA, a strike by ILA members is their decision and I don't think they will be swayed by public opinion in any meaningful way,"" he said.  ""What is more likely to happen is the pressure of a strike will likely force the employers back to the table with a much more substantial offer."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjepzxjrjgo,Why are we seeing the Northern Lights so often lately?,The sun is at the peak of an 11-year solar cycle that allows for more solar flares and more frequent sightings.,3 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"What used to be a once-in-a-lifetime event - or a bucket list trip to the Arctic circle – has become a more common sighting in the last couple of years. On Thursday night, the stunning colours of the Northern Lights were visible once again even to the naked eye across much of the US. Experts say the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are more visible right now due to the sun being at what astronomers call the “maximum” of its 11-year solar cycle. What this means is that roughly every 11 years, at the peak of this cycle, the sun’s magnetic poles flip, and the sun transitions from sluggish to active and stormy. On Earth, that’d be like if the North and South Poles swapped places every decade.  “At its quietest, the sun is at solar minimum; during solar maximum, the sun blazes with bright flares and solar eruptions,” according to Nasa, the US space agency. The current 11-year cycle, the 25th since records began in 1755, started in 2019 and is expected to peak next year. As a result the conditions that resulted in the recent activity will be in place for many months to come. The solar eruptions that caused the latest round of sparkling lights in the night sky began on 8 October, when a huge sunspot erupted on the sun's surface 93 million miles (150 million kilometres) away. The eruption sent a stream of electrically charged particles called ions towards Earth. This stream is known as solar wind. Aurora displays occur when the charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the magnetic poles. As they collide, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful blinking and swirling displays in the sky. During this maximum moment in the solar cycle, the number of sunspots increases which leads to more Coronal Mass Ejections sending charged particles to Earth, creating the aurora. In the northern hemisphere, most of this activity takes place near the Arctic Circle. When solar activity is strong, this can expand to cover a greater area.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj04955442ro,Myanmar rebels reject embattled junta's peace offer,The offer comes after battlefield losses and defections in the three-year-long civil war.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Rebel groups have rejected a peace offer from Myanmar’s embattled junta, which is reeling from battlefield losses and defections in a civil war that has dragged on for more than three years. This is dictatorship's first such outreach since it seized power in 2021. It also comes after a ceasefire brokered by China in the northern Shan state fell apart. The junta called on ethnic armed groups and ""terrorist insurgent groups"" to ""communicate with us to solve political problems politically"", also urging them to join elections planned for next year. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) said the offer was not worth considering, adding the junta had no authority to hold an election. The junta extended an olive branch Thursday as it struggled to fight on multiple fronts and stem a widespread rebellion.  Some reports say the junta now has control of less than half of Myanmar's territories.  In June, an alliance of three ethnic armies renewed an offensive against the military, seizing territory along a key highway to China's Yunnan province, which borders Myanmar. The fighting near the border in Shan state has blocked China's ambitious plan to connect its landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar. Beijing's top diplomat, Wang Yi, is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing during a visit to Myanmar last month. Armed groups should follow ""the path of party politics and elections in order to bring about lasting peace and development"", the junta said in its statement on Thursday. ""The country's human resources, basic infrastructure and many people's lives have been lost, and the country's stability and development have been blocked [because of the conflict]"" it said. But the rebel groups are sceptical of the offer.  The Karen National Union (KNU), which has been fighting for decades with the military for more autonomy along the border with Thailand, told AFP news agency that talks were only possible if the military agreed to ""common political objectives"". ""Number one: no military participation in future politics. Two [the military] has to agree to a federal democratic constitution,"" KNU spokesman Padoh Saw Taw Nee told AFP. ""Number three: they have to be accountable for everything they have committed... including war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" he said. ""No impunity."" If the junta does not accede to these demands, the KNU will ""keep putting pressure on [the junta] politically and militarily,"" he added. Maung Saungkha, the leader of the Bamar People's Liberation Army, told Reuters news agency that his group is ""not interested in this offer"".  ""They are hanging goat’s heads but selling dog meat,"" Soe Thu Ya Zaw, commander of the Mandalay People’s Defense Forces, wrote on Facebook. After the military ousted Myanmar's democratically-elected government in 2021, peaceful protests were met with killings and arrests.  This led ethnic armed groups to join forces with anti-coup militias across the country to fight back, plunging the country into a civil war. At least 50,000 people have been killed since the coup and more than two million people displaced, according to the United Nations. The UN warned last week that Myanmar was ""sinking into an abyss of human suffering"". Eyewitnesses had previously told the BBC about how the military has tourtued people in its custody, including by pouring burning petrol on them and forcing some to drink their urine. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7jewdje17o,Georgia elections board to require hand count of ballots,"The move, likely to face legal challenges, comes just weeks before early voting starts in the key battleground state.",21 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US state of Georgia has ordered a hand count of ballots cast in November’s election, potentially creating further delays in a system that took days to deliver a definitive result four years ago. Georgia's elections board voted 3-2 to require the hand count, despite the objections of state officials and poll workers. Around five million votes for president were cast in Georgia in 2020, with Joe Biden beating Donald Trump in the key battleground state state by a margin of around 12,000. While hand counting of ballots is common in many countries, including the UK, it is extremely rare in US elections.  The rule passed on Friday requires three poll workers in each of the state’s 6,500 voting precincts to begin counting ballots on election night. The move was opposed by the state’s top election official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, who warned that a hand count would introduce the possibility of “error, lost or stolen ballots, and fraud"". In a phone call following the 2020 election, Trump pressured Raffensperger to ""find 11,780 votes"" – a move which along with other alleged efforts to overturn the result led to criminal charges against Trump and some of his allies.  Raffensperger publicly tussled with Trump but also ordered a hand recount of the state's ballots, which slightly changed vote totals but confirmed the overall result.  Trump’s supporters on the Georgia elections board argued that hand counting will make the forthcoming election more secure. ""What I don’t want to do is set a precedent that we are OK with speed over accuracy,"" said board member Janelle King. Opponents of the move included county elections supervisors, poll workers and voting rights organisations, several of whom testified at a hearing on Friday. They warned of delays and possible chaos caused by changing the rules so close to the election. Early voting in Georgia starts on 15 October. Election day is on 5 November. Ethan Compton, the election supervisor for Irwin County, said that ballots had already been sent to members of the military posted overseas. “The election has begun,"" Mr Compton said. ""This is not the time to change the rules. That will only lower the integrity of our elections."" The board's chair, John Fervier, a Republican, voted against the rule for that reason. ""I do think it's too close to the election,"" he said. Fervier warned that the board may not have the legal authority to require hand counting, and the change is almost certain to face legal challenges. Voting rights organisations say hand counting would complicate the voting system and is less accurate than machine counting.  Many Republicans, meanwhile, believe Trump’s oft-repeated but false claims that the voting system is riddled with fraud and has been “rigged” by Democrats. During an rally in Atlanta in August, Trump called the board members ""pit bulls fighting for victory"". Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, said of the election board prior to the vote: ""They are fully trying to set up a scenario in which they could refuse to certify an election whose results they don't like."" The rule change came as early voting got under way on Friday in other states including Virginia, Minnesota and South Dakota.

Only two candidates out of more than a dozen other hopefuls were allowed to stand against President Saied in Sunday's ballot, where only 29% of the more than nine million registered voters took part.  Saied's closest challenger, businessman Ayachi Zammel, won 7% of the vote despite being sentenced to 12 years in prison for falsifying documents - just five days before the poll. There were no campaign rallies or public debates, and nearly all the campaign posters in the streets were backing the president. Five political parties had urged people to boycott the elections in the belief that they would not be free or fair. Tunisia was where a wave of pro-democracy protests in the Arab world began in late 2010, ousting long-time autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali early the following year. The North African country was seen as a beacon of democracy in the region. But since Saied, a former law professor, was elected on a wave of optimism in 2019, the 66-year-old has suspended parliament, rewritten the constitution and concentrated power into his hands. He was widely expected to win a second term after the authorities arrested and jailed dissidents as well as potential rivals. ""According to preliminary results, Saied received 2,438,954 favourable votes,"" the country's Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) said on Monday evening.  The third candidate on the ballot, former lawmaker Zouhair Maghzaou, received nearly 2% of the vote.  The final results of the presidential election are set to be announced early next month, according to the electoral agency.  Sunday's vote was Tunisia's third presidential election since Ben Ali was overthrown in 2011 following months of massive protests. He had been in power for over two decades before he was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia, where he died in 2019.  Rights group Amnesty International has denounced ""a worrying decline in fundamental rights"" under Saied's government as discontent rises over his perceived authoritarian style of governance.  But Saied has rejected the criticism, saying he is fighting a “corrupt elite” and “traitors”. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c153x54049eo,YouTuber and Rwandan government critic jailed,The 56-year-old is popular on YouTube for his videos that are critical of President Kagame's government.,5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A Rwandan YouTuber has been sentenced to seven years in prison for breaching the country's laws on genocide denial. Rashid Hakuzimana, who was arrested in 2021, denied all the charges, which also included inciting ethnic division and spreading false information for claiming that anyone who dares to challenge President Paul Kagame in elections is jailed. During the trial, he told the court that it was criticism of the government in his popular YouTube videos that was the real reason for his arrest. Under Rwandan law, it is a crime to deny, downplay or to attempt to justify the genocide, in which about 800,000 people were killed in 1994. Ethnic Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus were targeted in the 100-day massacre by Hutu extremists. The mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels who ended the genocide are accused by rights groups of killing thousands of Hutu people in retaliation as they took power - an allegation denied by the RPF-led government. The genocide remains a hugely sensitive issue in Rwanda and it is illegal to fuel any sort of division. The judge who sentenced Hakuzimana on Tuesday said his remarks on YouTube, such as those suggesting that genocide orphans were not as well cared for as the children of senior government officials, amounted to fuelling division. The YouTuber and government critic has attracted thousands of viewers on his Rashid TV channel. The 56-year-old represented himself during the trial, but refused to mount a defence because he wanted to be referred to as a politician in court, not a YouTuber. He also complained that he had spent three years in jail since his arrest. Following his sentencing, Hakuzimana will serve four years in prison - as the three years already spent in prison will be taken into account. He was also fined $700 (£500). It is not yet clear if he will appeal. Human rights group have accused Kagame's government of using the genocide denial legislation to crack down on dissent - an allegation the government denies. Last year, a court extended a 15-year sentence by a further two years for another YouTuber found guilty for inciting violence, denigrating genocide memorials and spreading rumours. Yvonne Idamange had denied the charges during the trial in 2021, which she then boycotted. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq647yv3rj2o,Zambian president suspends judges who ruled in favour of rival,The three judges were among those set to decide whether ex-President Lungu can stand in next year's poll.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema has suspended three top judges over alleged judicial misconduct, prompting accusations of political interference in the judiciary.  In 2016, the three Constitutional Court judges dismissed President Hichilema’s petition, in which he challenged the election victory of former President Edgar Lungu. They also took part in a controversial ruling allowing Lungu to stand in the 2021 elections, despite having twice served as Zambia’s president. Political tensions are rising in Zambia ahead of elections in 2026, when Hichilema and Lungu are expected to face each other for a fourth time. The three were due to be part of a bench sitting on Thursday in a case which would decide whether Lungu can contest those elections. The judges' suspension, which has sparked sharp reactions, was based on recommendations by a panel which investigates them, the presidency said.   The suspended judges - Justice Annie Sitali, Justice Mungeni Mulenga, and Justice Palan Mulonda - are yet to comment on the matter.  The trio have been investigated by the Judicial Complaints Commission (JCC), following a complaint by Moses Kalonde, a private citizen. Last year, the JCC rejected a complaint from lawyer Joseph Busenga, who had petitioned for the removal of the three judges, alleging that they had mishandled the 2016 presidential election petition. The JCC has in the past dismissed several similar petitions against the three judges.   In the 2016 case, the judges ruled against Hichilema and in favour of Lungu, the man he eventually replaced. After two years of investigations, President Hichilema on Monday suspended them on the recommendation of the JCC, the presidency said.  ""The suspensions of the three is in exercise of the powers vested in the president,"" the presidency statement stated, without giving further details.  The move sparked sharp criticism, with Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) saying the suspension was illegal.  “I want to say to the Zambian people that the time has come for you to stand up and fight the injustice which is being applied to the judiciary because when we lose the judiciary, we would have lost everything,” Lungu told journalists on Tuesday.  Activists have also accused President Hichilema of meddling in the independence of the judiciary.  Neither the president nor his office have responded to the accusation.  However, some argue that the judiciary has already become politicised. Social and political commentator Laura Miti says the judges deserve to be sacked but the president is at least partly motivated by revenge. “My honest view is that the judges harmed the country and now and the president is doing the same,” she wrote on her Facebook page. The judges' suspension comes barely 48 hours before the Constitutional Court sits to hear Lungu’s re-opened eligibility case.  The former president has announced a political comeback and is set to contest the 2026 presidential race - against Hichilema.  ""It is an extremely dangerous political game that Hichilema is playing over this desire to exclude Lungu,"" political analyst Sishuwa Sishuwa posted on X.  The three judges will now go through a disciplinary procedure, after which they will either be removed from the bench or be reinstated. Under Zambia's constitution, all judges, including the chief justice, are appointed by the president upon the recommendation of the JCC and with the approval of the National Assembly. Critics say the president’s involvement in the appointment and removal of judges compromises the independence of the judiciary.

Ex-sports minister Oswald Homeky was caught on Tuesday while handing over six bags of money to the head of the Republican Guard, Elonm Mario Metonou, the prosecutor told a press conference. Investigators said Col Djimon Dieudonne Tevoedjre was being bribed not to resist a coup d'etat planned for Friday in the small West African nation. Also detained was a businessman, Olivier Boko - a friend of President Talon - who had recently indicated he had political ambitions.  Mr Boko's lawyers and supporters condemned what they called his ""abduction"" and have demanded his immediate release. Investigations are ongoing to identify further suspects, the prosecutor said. Benin, once praised as a multi-party democracy, has taken a more autocratic turn under the presidency of Patrice Talon, rights groups say. President Talon announced he would not seek a third term in office in the 2026 elections.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e8q50y3v7o,How hurricane conspiracy theories took over social media,The misinformation has been fuelled by a social media universe that rewards engagement over truth.,4 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A deluge of misinformation online about back-to-back hurricanes in the US has been fuelled by a social media universe that rewards engagement over truth. The scale and speed of false rumours about Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton has been unlike many of the frenzies I’ve investigated online before. Viral posts have ranged from seemingly innocuous questions about the legitimacy of forecasts and rescue efforts, to false claims - repeated by Donald Trump - that hurricane relief funds are being spent on migrants who entered the US illegally. Others spread false images of the wreckage - faked pictures of children fleeing devastation that were generated by artificial intelligence (AI), old clips showing different storms or computer-generated (CGI) videos. And then there were those who shared false and evidence-free conspiracy theories about the government manipulating - or “geo-engineering”- the weather. “Yes they can control the weather,” wrote Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene last week on X.  Most of the viral misinformation has come from social media profiles which have blue ticks and a track-record for sharing conspiracy theories. Several accounts which spread Hurricane Milton misinformation this week had previously shared posts suggesting real-life events were staged or rigged, from elections to political violence, the pandemic and wars. I messaged dozens of accounts which shared false and misleading posts on X related to both hurricanes. Their accounts seemed to be able to go viral precisely because of changes made at X since Elon Musk became owner. While the blue-check used to be given out only to people who had been verified and vetted, users are now allowed to purchase these ticks. The algorithm, in turn, gives their posts greater prominence. They can also then profit from sharing posts, regardless of whether they are true or not. X’s revenue sharing policy means that blue-tick users can earn a share of revenue from the ads in their replies. On 9 October, the site announced that “payouts are increasing”, and accounts would now be paid based on engagement from other users who pay to get Premium membership, not the adverts in their responses. This has incentivised some users to share whatever it is that will go viral – however untrue. Several of those I messaged acknowledged to me that they benefitted from getting engagement from their posts and sharing content they know will get attention. It’s true, most social media companies allow users to make money from views. But YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook have guidelines which allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post content that spreads misinformation, and say they label posts when they are misleading. X does not have guidelines on misinformation in the same way. While it has rules against faked AI content and ""Community Notes"" to add context to posts, it removed a previous feature which allowed users to report misleading information.  X did not respond to the BBC’s request for comment. Misleading posts which go viral on X can also travel over to the comment section of videos on other sites, too, showing how an idea shared on one site can spread through the social-media ecosystem. ""Wild Mother"", a social media influencer who regularly shares unproven theories across different sites, said that four years ago, her comments were filled with “people calling me names, denying it”. “And now, I was surprised to see that nearly every comment is in agreement,” she said, referring to a recent post discussing conspiracy theories about geo-engineering and the recent hurricanes. There is a real-world impact to this kind of disinformation, which can undermine trust in authorities - in this case - during a complex rescue and recovery operation following Hurricane Milton. Although misinformation has always spread during natural disasters, there’s a crucial difference between now and previous storms. For one, the falsehoods being shared are spreading to more people – fewer than three dozen false or abusive posts were viewed 160 million times on X, according to the Institute of Strategic Dialogue think tank. They have also taken on a sharper political edge because of the impending US  presidential election. Many of the most viral posts come from accounts which support Donald Trump, ISD found. And they are taking aim at foreign aid and migrants. Several posts and videos have even targeted relief workers, who are accused of “treason” for taking part in untrue, outlandish plots. The anger and distrust this can foster risks inhibiting efforts on the ground. Ahead of an election, it also risks undermining wider faith in how systems and government work, and of overshadowing any legitimate criticism of governments’ efforts. While Wild Mother, and people like her, choose to view this as a sign that “more and more people are waking up to reality"", I see it as a sign that these conspiracy theories are gaining a wider audience. She tells me how “a well informed collective is much harder to control”. In other words, the more people who believe these kinds of evidence-free conspiracy theories, the harder it is to combat them. This ultimately comes down to the way the algorithms across social media sites favour engagement above all else. These conspiracy theories, false claims and hate can reach hundreds of thousands of people before anyone realises they’re are untrue - and those sharing them can be rewarded with views, likes, followers or money in return.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czeg87x125ro,'We're barely scraping by': Gen Z says money matters in US election,The rising costs of groceries and rent are driving many young voters to the polls.,7 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US presidential election is just weeks away and one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention from both parties: young voters.  But it’s economic woes – from inflation to housing – that could drive them to the polls. It’s Isabella Morris’s first presidential election, and the 21-year-old mum from Rosenberg, Texas, said she’s listening closely to what both candidates have to say. Recently married with a two-year-old, Isabella works part-time to supplement her husband’s full-time income. She stays at home with her child while her family rents a small one-bedroom apartment. The plan seemed solid—two incomes, no mortgage, or daycare costs—but it’s not enough. “Our debts are paid off, but we can’t afford any mistakes. We have no savings, nothing. One job used to be enough to live on, even at a minimum wage. Now it feels like we’re barely scraping by,"" she said. Economic fears about her future will drive her to vote in November, but when she spoke to the BBC, she was still undecided on which candidate she would support. “As these elections draw closer, we cannot possibly fathom a candidate not addressing the economic crisis right now,” she said. Isabella is one of 8 million young people who will be voting in a presidential election for the first time. Comprising about a third of the US electorate, voters under 35 are being fought over by both parties, and polls show the economy is their top priority this election season. Though reproductive rights, the war in Gaza and gun violence have dominated headlines when it comes to young voters’ policy priorities, 18 to 26-year-olds rank economic growth, income inequality and poverty as the most important problems facing the country, according to a Gen Forward Survey conducted by the University of Chicago and released in September. That’s in contrast to the 2020 election, when Covid-19, racism, and healthcare outranked the economy as the main issue driving young voters to the polls, according to the same survey. Isabella’s concerns reflect the broader challenges facing young voters, who are entering a world of high rents, unaffordable homes and slowing job creation - not to mention a once-in-a-generation surge in prices, according to economics TikToker Kyla Scanlon. Last month, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years, a decision which could lead to lower borrowing costs on mortgages, credit cards and saving rates for millions of people. But it remains to be seen whether the change in rates will change people’s outlook on the economy. ""The overall situation has degraded,"" Ms Scanlon, 27, told the BBC, noting that young people today have it worse than previous generations - even millennials who entered the workforce after the 2008 financial crisis. A Gen Z-er herself, Ms Scanlon often turns to TikTok, where she has more than 180,000 followers, to educate young people about the economy. People aged 22-24 hold more debt of all kinds – credit cards, car loans and mortgages – than millennials did at the same age, the credit agency TransUnion found. And their debt is rising faster than their income. “There's no beginner mode anymore - the bottom rung of the ladder just feels completely gone, I think, for most of the generation,” Ms Scanlon said. And those fears of being left behind could drive voters to the ballot box, experts say. Abby Kiesa, deputy director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (Circle), told the BBC she expects about half of young voters to turn out in this election – a similar proportion to 2020, which had the highest turnout in decades and an 11% increase compared to the presidential election in 2016. Meanwhile, the 2018 midterms saw a record-breaking turnout among young voters, according to Circle. That’s still far below the turnout of other age groups. In 2020, 69% of eligible Americans aged 35-64 voted, while 74% of voters over the age of 65 went to the polls, according to the US Census. But in an election that will be won by a razor’s edge, being able to rally a significant percentage of new voters could help give a candidate the boost they need to win.  Ms Kiesa said focusing on addressing economic hardship will be key if politicians hope to boost turnout among Gen Z-ers feeling disconnected from politics. “For the past three elections, turnout among young voters has been historic,” she said. “We need candidates who understand, engage, and speak with them. That’s what has to change.” The two presidential nominees - Trump and Harris - have both sharpened their economic message in recent weeks and stepped up efforts to appeal to young voters. Harris has expanded on the Biden administration’s economic initiatives around student loan forgiveness, consumer pricing and housing affordability. She’s proposed a $25,000 subsidy for first-time home buyers and a $6,000 tax credit for families with newborns. Her campaign has doubled her youth organising staff and invested heavily in digital ads. She has enjoyed endorsements from high-profile celebrities including Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, and built momentum by embracing viral memes about the vice-president on social media. Harris has also spent the last year touring college campuses in key battleground states. Meanwhile, Trump has sought to capitalise on economic dissatisfaction among young people, attacking Harris and Biden’s economic record and highlighing lower prices on goods under his administration. Both he and Harris have promised to eliminate tip taxation - a move aimed at the service industry, which employs millions of young people - and committed to ending regulatory barriers on cryptocurrency. The former president has also tried to reach younger voters through social media, podcasts, and partnerships with influencers. He’s posted TikToks with influencers like Logan Paul and Adin Ross. Polls showed Trump made inroads among young voters while he was running against Biden, who is 81. When Biden was still in the race, he led Trump by only a few percentage points, and the GenForward survey showed young people thought Trump handled the economy better than the Biden administration. But momentum has shifted back to the much younger Harris. She now holds a 31-point lead over Trump among likely voters aged 18-29, according to the Harvard Institute of Politics poll released in late September. Economic woes aren’t just driving people to vote, they’re lighting a fire in some young people to run for office themselves. Gabriel Sanchez, 27, a Democratic candidate for the Georgia state legislature, said he’s running for office to try to help ease the financial strain on his generation. As a waiter at a sports bar, he said rent hikes have forced him to move repeatedly. He is concerned that essentials like stable housing are becoming a privilege for many young Americans. “Most of us aren’t able to own a home, afford healthcare or buy the basic things we need,” Sanchez said in a TikTok posted on his campaign account. In May, Sanchez and three other young candidates cruised to victory in Georgia’s Democratic primary election, an outcome dubbed as Gen Z’s night in Atlanta. Sanchez said he believes his economic struggles resonated with voters. “We’re working hard but not seeing any rewards. This economy isn’t working for us,” Sanchez said. “We need representation - candidates who understand what young people are going through.” But it’s not only Democrats that are luring young candidates. Wyatt Gable, a 21-year-old in his last year at East Carolina University, won the Republican primary for North Carolina’s House of Representatives. He defeated George Cleveland, a 10-term, 85-year-old, incumbent. If elected in November, Gable will become the youngest person ever to hold a seat in the state legislature. As he prepares for the November vote, he said he expects the economy to be top of mind for young people at the polls this year. “My generation feels it. Seeing how bad inflation is, and with interest rates skyrocketing, that's going to be the biggest thing on young people's minds when they go to the ballot box,” he said.

Tunisia was where the Arab Spring, a series of uprisings against autocratic rulers in North Africa and the Middle East, began in late 2010.  The country was seen as a beacon of democracy for the Arab world. But since President Saied was elected on a wave of optimism in 2019, the 66-year-old has suspended parliament, rewritten the constitution and concentrated power into his hands.  This is Tunisia's third presidential election since Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown in 2011. He had been in power for over two decades before he was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia following months of massive protests. Sarah Yerkes, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with an expertise in the Middle East, told the BBC, that the president had ""manipulated the political and legal situation to such an extent that there is no contest – he is the only viable candidate"". There have been no campaign rallies or public debates, and nearly all the campaign posters in the streets have been of the president. Tunisia's election was ""really a referendum on Kais Saied"", Ms Yerkes added. The North African country’s largest opposition party, Ennahda, said its senior members had been arrested at a level it had not seen before. New York-based group Human Rights Watch reported that the authorities had excluded eight other prospective candidates from the election through prosecution and imprisonment. In recent weeks, people have taken to the streets of the capital, Tunis, to protest against President Saied and demand free-and-fair elections. Although Zammel, who heads the small liberal Azimoun party, was jailed for falsifying voter signatures on his candidacy paperwork, his name will still appear on the ballot paper. He has denied the charges, the Reuters news agency reports.  The other candidate, former lawmaker Zouhair Maghzaoui, had been a supporter of the president's 2021 power grab but later became a critic. “Tunisian authorities are waging a clear pre-election assault on the pillars of human rights,"" said Agnès Callamard, the secretary-general of rights group Amnesty International. Ms Yerkes told the BBC that Tunisia's leader had ""steadily dismantled a decade-worth of democratic progress"". But he was initially seen in a very different light.   When Saied, an acclaimed legal scholar, won more than 70% of the presidential vote in 2019, he promised “a new Tunisia”.  He represented ""the non-elite in Tunisia"" and tried ""to be a voice for the more marginalised populations"", said Ms Yerkes. A rejuvenated economy and curbing corruption were a few of the promises he made after his victory. When asked what he would do about the economy, he told a local newspaper, he would ""empower the people with tools"". He did not specify what these tools would be. Nicknamed “the professor”, he had immense support, especially among young people disillusioned by the endless bickering of the political classes.  But in 2021, he initiated what experts describe as a “self-coup” when he dismissed parliament and assumed all executive power.  He justified his actions by saying he needed new powers to break the cycle of political paralysis and economic decay. That same year he denied having any autocratic aspirations in an interview with the New York Times when he quoted the former French President Charles de Gaulle saying: ""'Why do you think that, at 67, I would start a career as a dictator?'”  Under Saied's rule, Tunisia has dropped from 53rd place to 82nd on the Economist Intelligence Unit's democracy index, which measures political freedoms and pluralism. “He has already returned Tunisia to autocracy,” said Ms Yerkes. In addition to Tunisia's faltering democracy, the lack of jobs is another hot topic. Unemployment is at 16%, according to the World Bank.  The country's troubled economy has forced many young people to emigrate. Tunisia is a key departure point for migrants who want to reach Europe.  UN figures show that at least 12,000 migrants who landed on Italy's shores last year left from Tunisia. Fearing a further influx of migrants, the European Union made a deal with Tunisia, giving the country $118m (£90m) to stop smuggling, strengthen borders and return migrants. Saied has also taken a populist approach to stoke support and blamed migrants for the country's economic problems.  He accused black sub-Saharan migrants of partaking in a “plot” to change the country's demographic profile, blaming “traitors who are working for foreign countries”. This led to a spate of racist attacks against black people living in Tunisia. While his rhetoric has garnered him some support, there are those who have been turned off by the remarks.  Groups in the country organised anti-racist protests in response to his comments. He has attempted to shift blame but has “shown no signs that he can turn the economy around”, said Ms Yerkes.  In his first electoral statement, published just after official campaigning began, Saied pledged to strengthen health services, transport and social security after decades of efforts to ""eliminate"" public institutions. Saied's consolidation of power has led to an apathetic mood ahead of the elections.  Last year, only 11% of the electorate turned up to vote for new members of parliament. It is “likely that the turnout this time around will be similarly abysmal”, said Ms Yerkes.  The official results will be announced within three days of the election but the outcome is hardly in doubt. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce81g9593dro,US debt would increase under Harris and soar under Trump - study,"Both candidates would add trillions to the national debt if their proposals were enacted, according to a new analysis.",7 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump's campaign proposals would increase the US national debt by double the amount Kamala Harris's would, according to a new analysis by a non-partisan group. Both candidates would add trillions to the national debt if their campaign pledges were enacted, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump would add $7.5tn and Harris would add $3.5tn, the group said. The think tank warned on Monday that neither party appeared willing to address the country's growing $35.6tn debt. Both candidates have, at least partially, backed extending major tax cuts that the US passed during Trump's first term. These cuts form the biggest chunk of this hypothetical additional debt. Parts of that Trump tax plan are due to expire in 2025, setting up a tough tax fight for whoever wins the White House in November. Trump has vowed to extend the tax package in its entirety. He has also proposed new cuts which would eliminate taxes on overtime, social security and tips income, and grant domestic manufacturers an ultra low corporate rate of 15%.  He said he plans to raise money by imposing widespread tariffs - a tax on goods imported into the country, which could raise $2.7tn, according to the CRFB. Harris, by contrast, has pledged to roll back tax cuts for the wealthy and raise the 21% rate for corporations, which was meant to be permanent, to 28%. But she would extend the Trump cuts for Americans earning less than $400,000 and has backed his idea of eliminating taxes on tips.  Harris has also put forward a number of other proposals for tax relief, aimed at families with children and start-ups, while endorsing plans to subsidise child care and health care with hundreds of billions in new spending.  Many of their proposals would have to be approved by Congress, and it remains unclear how much either candidate would be able to muscle through the divided legislative branch which has ultimate power over taxes and spending.  ""Both candidates are wanting to get elected so, you know, tax cuts sound better than higher taxes so I think that's what you're hearing. Whether or not all of that gets through we'll see,"" said Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of the investment firm Wealth Consulting Group. But Mr Lee said he thought investors were not ""paying enough attention"" to the threat from spiralling borrowing.  The US has long been able to borrow cheaply, thanks to strong demand for its debt among private investors, which has helped to keep interest rates relatively low.  But some analysts have warned that the US may be facing higher costs in the future.  The ratio of US debt to its economy or GDP, gross domestic product is already one of the highest among major economies in the world.  It stands at about 120%, according to the IMF. That compares to 144% in Italy, 110% in Spain, 101% in the UK, 106% in Canada, 77% in China, 67% in Germany and 56% in Australia. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp39yz3wdl9o,Is Reform UK's plan to get Farage into No 10 mission impossible?,The party is trying to professionalise to break the mould of British politics and win real power.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"At their annual conference this weekend, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said his party had passed through its adolescent tantrums and was now coming of age. But party insiders know the party still has a lot of growing up to do if it is going to seriously challenge for power at the next general election. They certainly don’t lack ambition – their aim is to make Farage the next prime minister. But this is not Farage’s first rodeo. When he was leader of the UK Independence Party (Ukip), it looked for a brief moment like a smaller party would break the Labour-Conservative mould of British politics. There is no doubt that Ukip had a huge influence in paving the way for Brexit, but it never managed to become a serious force in Parliament, and Farage famously failed seven times to get himself elected as an MP. He finally broke his duck at July’s general election and with five MPs, Reform UK is doing better than his old party - which is still going - ever managed. But Reform UK’s 14% vote share was not much higher than what Ukip achieved in 2015. Reform UK faces many of the same problems of Ukip – an army of enthusiastic, but often ill-disciplined, supporters and candidates with a habit of saying racist or just plain bizarre things on social media. They admit they have no base on councils, a patchy local branch structure, and a general lack of professionalism. Farage is keenly aware that to challenge for real power, he needs to attract middle-of-the-road voters turned off by endless scandals. He has vowed to beef up the internal vetting of candidates, telling reporters: “The electorate punished us for having these bad apples in there. We can’t be clearer: if you are a racist bigot, there are other people you could be attracted to but it’s not us.” The word we kept hearing at the Birmingham conference was “professionalise”.  Farage even urged his party to learn from the Liberal Democrats – something he used to tell Ukip members as well – by concentrating on local activism and winning seats on councils. The first step in the professionalisation process is to turn Reform into a normal political party, rather than a limited company, with the majority of shares owned by its self-appointed leader. At the start of the conference, Farage announced he was giving up his shares in Reform UK Ltd. Members voted through a new constitution, which makes the party a non-profit organisation and gives them a say in policy formation. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the party’s conference, Reform UK’s chairman Zia Yusuf said: “We are serious about being the next party of government in this country, and our new constitution and structure will be fit for purpose for that mission.” He said senior Conservative staffers in the party’s headquarters had liked what they’d seen and expressed an interest in joining Reform UK. He’s also in talks with potential donors who had voted Labour, but were “equally disillusioned” with the party, he said. A former banker who sold his tech start-up company for more than £200m last year, Yusuf made a large donation himself to Reform UK during the general election campaign. A week after the election, he was appointed chairman of the party. Reform UK reported £2.6m in donations between April and June this year - far behind those received by Labour (£28.7m) and the Conservatives (£16.3m). The party will need plenty more donations to compete with its rivals in the future. When asked if he was speaking to big donors in London, Yusuf said: “I can’t talk about names. “But you’d be surprised at the diversity of people who are interested.” From a “centre-left” student who was pleased to see President Barack Obama elected, to a Conservative Party member, Yusuf has been on a political journey to Reform UK. Where this one ends will partly depend on whether Reform UK can scale up and localise its campaigning machinery. The party says it has about 200 local branches already and is training local chairmen to open up dozens more. A workshop for constituency activists was held in London a few weeks ago, and at the party conference, there was a meet-and greet with regional organisers. Tim Power is the campaign manager for a local branch in Wallasey on Merseyside. He said there was a vote among members to elect a leadership team and the branch was looking for a regular venue to plan its campaign activities. “Nigel is a magnet,” Power said. “I can see there is a desire and motivation to launch Reform into this fully national presence.” The party says these branches will be laser-focused on campaigning in target areas ahead of local elections next May. Reform UK is aiming to field hundreds of candidates and take seats on county councils in target areas, from Essex and Lincolnshire, to Norfolk and Kent. When Ukip was reaching its peak in 2013, the party made substantial gains in county council elections. Ukip was the opposition on the county councils in Kent and Lincolnshire, and the party was part of an alliance that took control of the one in Norfolk. “We’ll be doing much the same when it comes to our thinking and targeting,” one party source said. “But there are different issues.” Immigration is a major focus. The party has proposed a “freeze” on non-essential immigration. Tax cuts and reforming the NHS are key planks of Reform UK’s offer too. But one senior party figure said opposing net zero was likely to be as big a part of the party’s policy position as immigration come the next general election. “We know what we generally think,” another party source said. “We know our gut, but we’ve got to try to connect our heart to our brain.” They added: “We want voters to come to us for more than just being a plague on the other parties.” Farage has said winning hundreds of seats in next year's local elections would be considered a success. But party sources tempered expectations of a Ukip-style surge. “Ukip had a branch structure that had been going for 20 years,” one said. “We’ve got a branch structure that’s been going for 20 days.” Beyond these forthcoming local elections, the party has reason to believe there will be a wider market for its brand of politics. The party is organising conferences in Wales, Scotland and across the English regions in the coming months. The elections to the Welsh Parliament in 2026 are of particular interest to Reform UK, because the voting system is considered to be more favourable to smaller parties. In the general election, Reform UK came second in 98 constituencies, and in 89 of those, Labour won. Now, a recent poll by JL Partners suggested one in four Labour voters was considering supporting Reform. The next general election is a long way off though. A senior party figure said conference was “a building moment”. “We are acutely aware we are not there,” they added. “We are not yet worthy of government.” For all the talk of forming the next government, Reform UK is a long way from taking control of councils, let alone the country. Its operation was haphazard at times ahead of the general election, with candidates disowned over their comments. If Reform UK is serious about making Farage prime minister, they’ll need a much more robust party machine to match their ambitions."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241001-how-saturday-night-live-became-a-tv-phenomenon-but-then-lost-its-way,How Saturday Night Live lost its way,New film Saturday Night celebrates the legendary comedy show's origins – but last weekend's poor new season premiere confirmed it's on rockier ground than ever. What went wrong?,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"New film Saturday Night celebrates the legendary comedy show's origins – but last weekend's poor new season premiere confirmed it's on rockier ground than ever. What went wrong? Saturday Night Live has achieved legendary status – not a good thing for what is still meant to be a living, breathing comedy show. That is clear from the back-to-back premieres last weekend of a movie about the series' beginnings, and the new season of the show itself. Jason Reitman's film, Saturday Night, a loving but flimsy fictional account of the 90 minutes leading up to the first episode in 1975, was released on Friday. The next night you could have zoomed ahead almost half a century to watch the tepid, half-hearted 50th season premiere of SNL. Both suggest how much the myth of the show has overtaken its reality. SNL has earned its stature, of course. It transformed television comedy and has penetrated American culture. In 2004, Rachel Dratch started playing Debbie Downer, who saw the bleak side of everything. The term ""Debbie Downer"" is now simply shorthand for a wet blanket. And even a short list of the comic actors the show has produced is astonishing, from Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy through to Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, as well as the talk-show hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. Reitman's film goes back before all that, with the SNL writer Rosie Shuster (Rachel Sennott) trying to describe the show to a befuddled NBC network executive. ""It's postmodern, it's Warhol,"" she says of sketches that include a deadpan Andy Kaufman (Nicholas Braun) lip-synching to a recording of the theme from the children's cartoon Mighty Mouse. The humour was postmodern bordering on performance art, at least part of the time, and a radical change from the creaky musical variety shows that flooded television then. But the avant-garde inevitably becomes the establishment, and over the decades SNL has turned into the kind of show people complain is bad but watch anyway, from habit as much as anything else. Perhaps because it is so ingrained in popular culture, it still has some currency – but in the age of social media, SNL seems to respond to the culture instead of being on the cutting, forward-facing edge. When Kamala Harris announced that Tim Walz would be her running mate, social media exploded with speculation about who might play him on SNL. People had wish lists of possibilities, living and dead (comedy director Paul Feig wished it could have been Chris Farley). Near-lookalike Jim Gaffigan was among the most plausible, so it wasn't a huge surprise when he turned up on Saturday in the opening sketch about contrasting Harris and Trump rallies. That opening sketch was the highlight of the premiere before its long downward slide. Gaffigan's brief appearance did little more than echo the Walz dad-joke memes that have been online for months. Maya Rudolph was brilliant as a likeable Kamala Harris, a part she has played before. She captures the dancing, the laugh and the steeliness behind the buoyant energy of the ""fun aunt"", as the fictional Harris calls herself. But the comic gem was the surprise appearance of Andy Samberg as ""second gentlemensch"" Doug Emhoff. He entered doing a goofy dance that we haven't seen the real Emhoff do but we can totally imagine him doing. And Samberg nailed the delivery of every line, especially when enthusiastically talking about how he would embrace the traditional role of first spouse. ""I for one can't wait to decorate the White House at Christmas,"" he says. ""The theme will be Hanukkah."" That was the kind of sharp, funny, unexpected moment viewers hope for and rarely get. More like this: • 10 films about US presidential elections • The best films to watch in October • The greatest talk show host of all What's lost in the fog of the past is that these moments were always rare. SNL is known for its political humour, but for every portrayal that seems so potent it echoes through political reality – Tina Fey's scathing Sarah Palin impression, chirping, ""I can see Russia from my house,"" was brutally close to Palin's own floundering on foreign policy when running for vice-president – there are dozens of toothless caricatures like Alec Baldwin's purse-lipped Donald Trump, more an impersonation of a cartoon Trump than a satire. Reitman's film swallows the SNL myth whole and makes you wonder: who is this movie even for? Reitman grew up loving the show, and if you're already rabidly interested and familiar with the original cast, Saturday Night might work as homage. For anyone else, it doesn't do much to fill in the outlines. The premise is that there is chaos backstage. Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle), the show's nervous creator, grapples with some drug-fuelled cast members and puts out fires that include an actual fire when lights fall onto a couch. But the film is never as galvanising as it means to be, despite all the hyperactivity behind the scenes, along with fast-paced editing, visual flourishes that include the camera racing through the corridors of the studio and the unexplained presence of a llama. The cast simply plays into the baked-in images of the originals. John Belushi (Matt Wood) is a difficult genius who refuses to sign his contract. Chevy Chase (Cory Michael Smith) is an egotist. Gilda Radner (Ella Hunt) is sweet with a gentle wit. Jane Curtin (Kim Matula) feels underused, as women often were on the show. Dylan O'Brien captures the essence of Dan Aykroyd's comic performances and often smarmy characters. Writers pitch a sketch about Julia Child cutting herself while presenting her cooking show and comedically spurting blood. That sketch, with Aykroyd as Child, is a classic that turned up on a later episode. If you don't know details like that, good luck caring about the movie.    The best aspect of Saturday Night, its generational conflict, is underdeveloped. In brief appearances, Willem Dafoe plays Dave Tebet as a hilariously slippery old-time network executive. JK Simmons is effectively icky as the leering comedian and entertainer Milton Berle who, unfathomable though it seems now, was once one of the biggest stars on television. On a neighbouring stage, his corny song and dance number with chorus girls in spangly costumes suggests just how revolutionary SNL was. But mostly Reitman asks us to assume, or has someone tell us, that its comedy was radical. Lamorne Morris has one of the few moments that leaps off the screen. He plays Garrett Morris (no relation), the only black member of the original cast, who feels like an outsider. In a particularly memorable scene from the film, Morris grabs a microphone and sings a controversially bold song for a roomful of white television executives – a song featured in a sketch in a later episode of the show. It's still jaw-dropping and funny. And it's hard to imagine today's SNL being that risky. SNL was always more uneven than the myth suggests. Watch the real first episode now and it is, shockingly, not all that funny. Even the famous Bee Hospital sketch, with Belushi and others dressed as dad bees in a hospital waiting for news of their little bees' births, seems like it's straining to be absurdist. But given that the show is entering its high-profile 50th season, last weekend's live premiere was unusually rocky. Even its guest host Jean Smart, the beloved star who just won an Emmy for her HBO comedy Hacks, couldn't save it. There was a tired game show parody, a fake commercial about a Halloween store and a parody about casting I Love Lucy with Smart as a dramatic actress in the Lucille Ball role. More than one review summed it all up as disappointing.  That unevenness may not matter much, since fewer people watch whole network shows the way they did when SNL began. Today, breakout sketches – Ryan Gosling and Mikey Day as Beavis and Butt-Head or Bowen Yang as the iceberg from the Titanic and last weekend as the thirsty baby hippo Moo Deng bemoaning the cost of her fame and comparing it to Chappell Roan's – go viral, and clips are like gold. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the last season of SNL earned an astonishing 3.1 billion views on social media. That may be the main way the show has kept up with the moment. Far from being timely, though, in recent years it has often made headlines for controversial hosts whose selection suggests nothing more than pandering for ratings and influence with powerful people. Trump hosted in 2015 while he was running for president, drawing protests from Hispanic and immigration-rights groups outside the studio. Elon Musk hosted in 2021, and while there are a lot of elements to Musk's reputation, funny guy is not one of them.  NBC is celebrating the show's 50th season with a three-hour prime-time special in February. There's no need to wait for that to see that SNL has become more iconic than relevant. Maybe it needs more fun aunt. Or as one classic sketch put it, ""More cowbell!"" More something.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dj0833g99o,Mexican mayor murdered days after starting job,Alejandro Arcos is the second politician to be killed in a week in the city of Chilpachingo.,8 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The mayor of a Mexican city plagued by drug violence has been murdered less than a week after taking office. Alejandro Arcos was found dead on Sunday in Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in the southwestern state of Guerrero. He had been mayor for six days. Evelyn Salgado, the state governor, said the city was in mourning over a murder that ""fills us with indignation"". His death came three days after the city government's new secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot dead. Authorities have not released details of the investigation, or suspects. However, Guerrero is one of the worst-affected states for drug violence and drug cartels have murdered dozens of politicians across the country.  Authorities confirmed Arcos's murder after unverified social media images showed what appeared to be his remains. Arcos's social media posts show that he had spent his days in office supervising disaster relief efforts following Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding.  Pictures were posted to his Facebook account in the hours before his death of meetings with relief workers and residents. Alejandro Moreno, a Mexican senator, said Arcos and Tapia were ""young and honest officials who sought progress for their community"". He called on federal authorities to take charge of the investigation given Guerrero's ""ungovernability"". Arcos's Institutional Revolutionary Party called for justice. ""Enough of violence and impunity! The people of Guerrero do not deserve to live in fear,"" it said on Twitter/X. Politicians, particularly at the local level, frequently fall victim to bloodshed connected to corruption and the multibillion-dollar drugs trade. Guerrero is one of the worst affected states due to its location on the Pacific coast smuggling routes and Chilpancingo has long been the scene of turf battles between two drug gangs, the Ardillos and the Tlacos. At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's 2 June elections.  More than 450,000 people have been murdered and tens of thousands have gone missing across Mexico since the government deployed the army to combat drug trafficking in 2006."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33vjjg8k3yo,Book claims Trump secretly sent Covid test machine to Putin during shortage,"Trump campaign says none of the ""made-up stories"" in Watergate journalist Bob Woodward's book are true.",5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A new book by veteran Watergate reporter Bob Woodward says Donald Trump secretly sent coveted Covid-19 testing machines to Vladimir Putin for personal use when they were in short supply, a claim angrily dismissed by the Trump campaign. The book - titled War - also includes a claim that Trump secretly has stayed in touch with Putin since leaving office, according to excerpts cited by US media. In response, former President Trump told ABC News: ""He's a storyteller. A bad one. And he's lost his marbles."" The Trump campaign also said none of the ""made-up stories"" were true. “President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue,” said Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in a statement to the BBC on Tuesday. The new book, due out next week, attributes the continuing communications between the former president and Putin to a single Trump aide who is not named in the book. According to a report by the New York Times, the book describes one scene in which a Trump aide was ordered out of Trump’s office in Mar-a-Lago so the former  president could conduct a call with Putin. The unnamed aide reportedly said that the two may have spoken a half-dozen times since Trump left the White House in 2021. On Wednesday, the Kremlin denied the pair had spoken. The book does not say what they discussed, and it quotes a Trump campaign official casting doubt on the supposed contact. The BBC has not seen a copy of the book. The Times reported that Mr. Woodward wrote that he could not corroborate the aide's claim, and that other sources it reached out to were unaware of Trump and Putin contacting each other after he left office. Woodward, who rose to fame for his role in uncovering the Watergate scandal that brought down Richard Nixon’s presidency, has written several best-selling books based on access to high-level sources.   Calling Woodward “demented” and “deranged”, Trump campaign spokesperson said: ""Woodward is an angry little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously."" Trump had previously spoken to Woodward for the journalist's 2021 book - titled Rage. He later sued him over it, claiming Woodward did not have permission to release recordings of their interviews, an allegation denied by the author. In War, Woodward writes that while the former president was in office, Trump “secretly sent Putin a bunch of Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines for his personal use”. Putin was reportedly anxious about falling ill with the virus, according to the  retelling of Woodward's book in US media. The report adds that Putin had asked Trump not to publicly share that he had sent him the tests, fearful that it would damage Trump's reputation. “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,” Putin reportedly told Trump, according to the book cited by the Times. Trump reportedly said: “I don’t care. Fine.” The claims have resurfaced questions about the relationship between Trump and Putin just weeks before the 05 November election. The former president has been accused in the past of colluding with Russia to interfere with US elections, though a probe by the Department of Justice found no evidence of this and reached no conclusion as to whether Trump had obstructed the inquiry. The book also examines the long shadow cast by Trump over the foreign conflicts of the past four years and over the bitter US political environment in which they have unfolded, according to the Washington Post. It also includes candid assessments by President Joe Biden of his own missteps, including his decision to make Merrick Garland attorney general.  Reacting to the prosecution of his son Hunter — by a special prosecutor named by Garland  — the president told an associate, “Should never have picked Garland"", the Post reported."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp39zvnx9p3o,Reform UK council candidates to be vetted - Farage,"Speaking to BBC South East, Nigel Farage said he had ""no idea"" how bad vetting was in his party.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Nigel Farage has said Reform UK candidates for local elections in 2025 will be ""vetted"" following controversial comments during the General Election.  The party leader referred to Bexhill and Battle's Ian Gribbon who said Britain would be ""far better"" if it had ""taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality"" instead of fighting the Nazis. Speaking to BBC South East, Mr Farage said: ""I had no idea how bad it was. I had no idea that half of these people simply haven't been vetted - that's got to change."" Ahead of the party's conference in Birmingham, Mr Farage said he planned to place Reform UK candidates across wards in Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Former UKIP leader Mr Farage added the party expected gains next May, particularly in Kent County Council elections. In the general election, Reform UK were placed third in a number of Kent constituencies, and second in Dover and Deal.  He said: ""That was a building block and it was a building block for what comes next May. ""I am trying, working - and I'll be doing at the conference - to not only democratise the party, but professionalise the party. ""We have a massively bigger membership than UKIP ever had. ""We're seen as much more broadly-based than being seen to be just about Europe. I think we can win a lot of seats."" A key issue in the South East for Reform UK will be energy affordability and self-sufficiency, according to Mr Farage.  The MP for Clacton said he would want to bring a nuclear reactor back to Dungeness as an alternative to coal-fired power stations.  Dungeness power stations A and B were decommissioned in 2006 and 2021, respectively.  He said he'd like to see a ""Dungeness C"" and ""going for a small modular nuclear reactor"". He added: ""Why? There's a skilled local work force."" Mr Farage also refused to rule out fracking in Surrey and Sussex, but said any work would be done ""sensitively"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70zen890w1o,Haiti edges towards holding first elections since 2016,The creation of a provisional election council is seen as a key first step on the road to elections.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Haiti's government has taken a key step towards holding long-delayed elections with the creation of a body which will oversee the polls. The nine-member provisional electoral council - set up on Wednesday - has been tasked with organising elections by February 2026.  The last time Haitians voted someone into power was in 2016. Since then, armed gangs have seized control of almost the entire capital, Port-au-Prince, as well as large swathes of rural areas of Haiti. So far, seven members of the provisional electoral council (CEP) have been named.  Among them are representatives of the media, academia, trade unions, and religious groups.  The creation of the CEP comes less than two weeks after a visit to Port-au-Prince by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who had urged Haiti's provisional government to move forward with the electoral process. Blinken said setting up an electoral council was a ""critical next step"". Presidential elections were last held in Haiti in 2016, when Jovenel Moïse of the Tèt Kale party was elected for a five-year term.  Since Moïse's murder by Colombian mercenaries in July 2021, the post of president has been vacant. In the following years, Haiti was governed by Ariel Henry, the man whom President Moïse had nominated as his prime minister shortly before he was killed. But when Henry left for a summit in Guyana on 25 February 2024, gangs seized the international airport in Port-au-Prince and prevented him from returning. Henry resigned in April and a transitional presidential council (TPC) was created to lead the country until elections can be held. The TPC named Garry Conille as interim prime minister, to serve until a democratically elected government takes over. A Kenyan-led multinational security force was also despatched to help the Haitian police reign in the gangs. While the multinational force has succeeded in rounding up some gang leaders, the power of these criminal organisations has grown to such an extent that Prime Minister Conille expanded the state of emergency to the whole country earlier this month. The multinational force suffers from underfunding and so far only 600 Kenyans and a small contingent of Jamaicans have arrived in Haiti.  Last week, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres berated the international community for not offering Haiti more help: ""I find it a scandal that it has been so difficult to mobilize funds for such a dramatic situation.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rjgpp8e0o,Argentina politician eyes breakaway province plan,A minister in Buenos Aires province sparks controversy by suggesting that it could become independent.,6 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A minister in the government of Argentina's Buenos Aires province, the country's largest, has sparked controversy by suggesting that it could seek to become independent. Jorge D’Onofrio, who is transport minister in the province's left-wing Peronist administration, said in a radio interview that if it were a nation in its own right, it would have the ""biggest GDP in Latin America"". He described the policies of Argentina's national government, led by right-wing libertarian President Javier Milei, as ""madness"" and accused him of destroying the nation. D'Onofrio's comments mark the latest round of a power struggle between Argentina's central government and its biggest region. Buenos Aires province is at odds with the Milei administration on a number of issues, including transport policy.  The province, which does not include the city of Buenos Aires itself, is home to about 17.5 million people, which is nearly 40% of Argentina's population. Its main city is La Plata, which has a metropolitan area with nearly one million inhabitants. It is one of five provinces still governed by the opposition Peronists, who lost the national presidency to Milei in elections nearly a year ago. The province's governor is Axel Kicillof, an economist who has close ties to the Peronist faction led by ex-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Peronism, the political movement founded by the late President Juan Perón in the 1940s, dominated Argentine politics for many years, but Milei's victory in October 2023 has left it in disarray. In an interview on Radio Splendid, D'Onofrio said: ""I could be proposing today as a leader of Buenos Aires that we go to a constitutional reform to see if we get out of the national state."" He added: “If the province of Buenos Aires were a state today, it would have the richest GDP in Latin America."" He added that he did not think independence was the way forward, but that it was  ""a debate that we Buenos Aires citizens have to have, because we produce 45% of Argentina's wealth and we collect 22% of revenue sharing, subsidising the inefficiency of the rest of the national state and the provinces.”  The national government has just put forward plans to deregulate bus services, but Kicillof has warned that his province will not comply. If D'Onofrio has his way, the tussle could escalate even further. The transport minister said Buenos Aires even had the power to issue its own currency if it wanted to. But the idea was soon shot down by Luciano Laspina, a member of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies who belongs to the party of centre-right ex-President Mauricio Macri. ""The proposal to make the Province of Buenos Aires independent from the Argentine Republic - made by one of Kicillof's ministers - is the most ridiculous thing that has been said in years,"" Laspina said in a post on X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgd4yn45qlo,China 'punishes' Taiwan president remarks with new drills,Beijing says the exercise involved all parts of the military and simulates a full-scale attack on its neighbour.,9 hrs ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"China on Monday launched new military drills off the coast of Taiwan in what it described as ""punishment"" for a speech given by its president William Lai, when he vowed to ""resist annexation"" or ""encroachment upon our sovereignty"". China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and its president Xi Jinping has vowed to retake it by force if necessary.  Taiwan said it detected 34 naval vessels and 125 aircraft in formation around the island on Monday. Maps published by Chinese state media indicated its forces were positioned around the whole island. It said later on Monday that the drills had been successfully concluded.  The Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the drills involved all wings of the army and were designed to simulate attacking Taiwan by land, sea and air. Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command said the drills ""fully tested the integrated joint operation capabilities"" of its troops. Taiwan's airports and ports continued functioning as normal. An earlier statement from the Taiwanese defence ministry condemned the Chinese move and said its priority was to avoid direct clashes which could escalate the stand-off further. Outlying islands were put on high alert, it added.  China's foreign ministry confirmed it had simulated military assaults and port blockades, and described Taiwanese independence as being ""incompatible"" with peace in the region. A post by the Chinese coast guard on its Weibo account later noted that the route of the patrol was in the shape of a heart.  China has held several major military drills off the coast of Taiwan since 2022 and its fighter jets regularly enter Taiwanese airspace.  The latest exercise has been dubbed Joint Sword 2024-B by Beijing and had been widely expected since May, when drills bearing the same name and officially labelled as part A were staged. That exercise, which China described as its largest yet, were timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Lai, who Beijing has long seen as a ""troublemaker"" advocating for Taiwan's independence.  His latest comments, made on Taiwan's national day, were condemned by China, which said he was escalating tensions with ""sinister intentions"".  But while these drills were widely expected, if you look at the deployment and how close Chinese ships and aircraft are to Taiwan - as well as the fiery rhetoric - this is very aggressive behaviour. In any other context, this would be seen as a dramatic escalation - but it comes against the backdrop of tensions that were already very high. The US reacted by saying that there was no justification for the drills after Lai's ""routine"" speech, and that China should avoid further actions which may jeopardise peace and stability in the region. The recent history of China’s military intimidation of Taiwan goes back to 1996, after Taiwan held its first direct presidential elections. China declared several areas around Taiwan off limits, and fired short-range ballistic missiles into those areas off the north and south coasts.  US President Bill Clinton quietly moved US Navy forces into the Taiwan strait to demonstrate to Beijing that the US would prevent an attack on the island. Tensions eased considerably between 2008 and 2016 - until the leader of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen was elected as president. China considers the DPP to be a hard line pro-independence party, and responded by cutting off all direct contacts with the government in Taipei. That situation has remained ever since. In August 2022 US house speaker Nancy Pelosi flew into Taipei – the first time a sitting house speaker had visited the island since 1997. Pelosi’s visit and her open support for Taiwan was seen by Beijing as a huge provocation – coming close to a formal recognition of the government here by a very senior US politician. It reacted with fury – holding two days of exercises and for the first time ever flying ballistic missiles over the island and in to the Pacific Ocean."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lwgn9p8z4o,Crypto world hoping for Trump election win,Crypto currency firms are waiting to see how November's vote will impact upon them.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The cryptocurrency industry is “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters”, one of the United States’ top financial regulators has told the BBC. The chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, says the “investing public around the globe has lost too much money” because of crypto companies not following the laws his agency tries to enforce. It comes as the industry is spending millions of dollars on political donations, trying to influence the outcome of November’s US elections in the hope of more favourable future laws. In addition to the presidential battle between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, all 435 districts in the House of Representatives are up for re-election, as well as 33 of the 100 seats in the Senate. The future of cryptocurrency, one of the world’s most hotly-debated technologies, is an issue where there appears to be a clear dividing line between Donald Trump and the outgoing Biden administration. Trump has been courting the votes of crypto enthusiasts by promising to make America “the crypto capital of the planet”, and creating a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile” similar to the US government’s gold reserves. Last week he launched a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial, and although he provided few details, he said “I think crypto is one of those things we have to do”. It’s a huge turnaround from three years ago, when he dismissed Bitcoin as something that “seems like a scam” and a threat to the US dollar. Trump's new-found enthusiasm is a stark contrast to the Biden administration, of which Harris is the vice president. The White House has led a sweeping crackdown on crypto firms in recent years. In March, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and boss of FTX was jailed for 25 years for fraud, after he stole billions of dollars from customers around the world, many of whom are still trying to recover their money.  Then in April, the founder of the world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, got four months in prison, and the company paid a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) fine. He admitted to allowing criminals, child abusers and terrorists to launder money on his platform, in a case brought by the US Justice Department.  The SEC also has a case against Binance going through the courts. It is one of a record-high 46 enforcement actions the financial regulator took last year against firms trying to profit from what is still an emerging technology. “This is a field that has come along, and just because they're recording their crypto assets on a new accounting ledger, they [wrongly] say ‘we don't think we want to comply with the time-tested laws’,” says Mr Gensler. He explains that rules that force companies that want to raise money from the public to “share certain information” with them have been in place to protect investors since the SEC was created. This was back in 1934, in the aftermath of the infamous Wall Street crash of 1929 that heralded the Great Depression. “Crypto is just a small piece of the US and worldwide capital markets, but it can undermine trust that everyday investors have in the capital markets,” says Mr Gensler. While fans argue that crypto offers a fast, cheap and secure way to move funds, a survey by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, found that the number of Americans using it has dropped from 12% in 2021 to 7% last year. Harris has not said much about cryptocurrencies, but one of her advisers did say last month that she would “support policies that ensure that emerging technologies, and that sort of industry, can continue to grow”. Recent meetings between her team and industry executives have been trying to build trust, and given crypto bosses hope of a brighter future whoever wins in November. “I can't underscore enough how important this is, not just for the US, but for the world,” according to Paul Grewal, who is chief legal officer at crypto firm Coinbase. He has been at these meetings. “Not only is the US an important market for crypto, but so much of the important technology surrounding it has been developed here. And I think it's also critically important that we do not lose sight of the fact that the rest of the world is not simply waiting for the US to get its act together.” He adds that given how tight the race for the White House is, “every vote is going to count, and crypto votes are no exception”. The clampdown on cryptocurrencies in the US this year has been mirrored in Europe. In April, the European Union agreed new laws to try to reduce the risk of crypto being used by criminals. However, other regulators are being slower to act. The G20 group of leading economies is working on minimum standards for cryptocurrencies, but they are not legally binding, and uptake has been slow. Back in the US, a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies has been passed by the House, but not the Senate. Its critics argue it will give less protection to consumers. Coinbase’s Mr Grewal backs the bill, and says: “This is not an industry that is shying away from regulation.” He adds that the sector just wants the same standards applied to crypto as are applied to other assets, “no tougher, but no weaker”. With November’s US elections on the horizon, the crypto industry has sensed an opportunity to help elect lawmakers who take a sympathetic view of the businesses. By last month, the sector had already spent an unprecedented $119m on donations, according to research by the non-profit  Public Citizen.  The consumer advocacy organisation’s research director Rick Claypool says the money is being used “to help elect pro-crypto candidates and attack crypto critics, this is regardless of political affiliation”. They’ve spent more than any other industry when it comes to corporate donations, because they “are attempting to discipline the US congress to give in to their demands for less oversight, and to weaken protections for consumers,” he adds."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c206zn2gy37o,Ghost guns and transgender care: Major cases before US Supreme Court,The top US court is back in session with cases that may affect American life - and its standing in the public.,8 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A new nine-month term begins for the US Supreme Court on Monday with major cases that will shape many aspects of American life. The court's nine justices are back after last year's blockbuster term, which saw rulings that protected a widely used abortion pill or granting former President Donald Trump partial immunity from prosecution.  The coming months may bring legal disputes over the looming presidential elections, potentially consequential in what should be a closely-fought contest.  With its six-three conservative majority intact, its rulings may fuel further scepticism among the American public whose approval for its work is now at 43%, according to Gallup, a near-record low.  With a new year ahead, here's a look at some of the major cases on its docket.  Perhaps the most high-profile case of the term will be US v Skrmetti, where the justices will hear the Biden administration's challenge to a Republican-backed ban on gender care for minors. The Tennessee ban, which took effect in July 2023, prohibits certain treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, including the prescription of any puberty blockers or hormones, if the treatment is meant to ""enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex"" or treat ""purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity"".  A group of young transgender people, their families and medical providers, have joined the Biden administration in challenging a decision from the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that upheld the Tennessee ban.  The nine Supreme Court justices will be asked to weigh whether the ban violates the 14th Amendment of the US constitution, which grants equal protection under the law.  The decision could have consequences nationwide. More than 20 states have enacted laws in recent years to restrict access to bespoke care for transgender youth.  The restrictions have been opposed by major medical groups including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.  On the second day of its term, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to a new regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on so-called ""ghost guns"",  the mostly untraceable firearms made from at-home kits.  The case, Garland v VanDerStok, centres on whether the ATF may regulate these weapons in the same way it regulates commercial gun sales, including serial numbers and federal background checks.  The Biden administration first imposed the restrictions in 2022, but was quickly blocked by a lower court, which sided with a group of firearms owners, gun rights groups and firearms manufacturers who argued the ATF had overstepped its authority. The Justice Department then appealed, bringing the case to the country's highest court.  The case could have major implications for US gun control. The White House has said the unregistered weapons pose an increasing threat, with 20,000 suspected ghost guns found during criminal investigations in 2021 - a tenfold increase from five years earlier. The top court will also hear a case to clarify how courts can determine if a police officer acted with reasonable force.  A three-judge panel for the Fifth Circuit ruled this year that a Texas police officer reasonably feared for his life when he shot and killed a driver during a traffic stop in Houston in 2016.  Ashtian Barnes had been driving a vehicle his girlfriend rented, which had unpaid toll fees when officer Roberto Felix Jr stopped him. Mr Barnes initially stopped and opened his boot, but then began to drive away. Officer Felix jumped on to the vehicle and fired two shots into the car, according to dashcam footage. A bullet struck Mr Barnes in the head and he died.  Mr Barnes’s mother, Janice Hughes Barnes, sued on her son’s behalf, arguing the deadly use of force against her son was unreasonable and violated his Fourth Amendment rights, which protect people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.  The judges found that Officer Felix had behaved reasonably under the Fourth Amendment's ""moment of threat"" doctrine, which asks whether the officer had been in danger at the moment he used force. Under this standard, the officer's actions until that moment are not taken into account.  One of the justices on the panel, Judge Patrick Higginbotham, wrote a concurring opinion expressing frustration with the test, and asked the Supreme Court to intervene.   If he had been allowed to consider the ""totality of circumstances"", Judge Higginbotham said, he would have found the officer had violated Mr Barnes's Fourth Amendment rights.  Though a date on this case has not yet been set, at some point this term the Supreme Court justices will consider a challenge from the adult entertainment industry over a Texas law requiring pornography websites to verify the age of their users.   The law requires porn sites where one-third of their content is harmful to minors to use age-verification measures to ensure all visitors are 18 years of age or older.  It also requires the sites to post health warnings, saying porn is addictive, impairs development and increases the demand for child exploitation - claims the industry disputes.  Several other US states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana and North Carolina, require certain websites to verify the ages of visitors.  The Free Speech Coalition, which represents the porn industry, has challenged the law, saying it violates the First Amendment's free speech protection.  The challenge was successful before a federal district court, but that ruling was overturned on appeal by a Fifth Circuit panel.   The ruling could have broad implications for First Amendment protections, possibly upending past ruling which found the free speech rights of adults outweighed the possible harm to minors. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2m0k4z3jyo,'It was respectable': Midwest voters praise tone of VP debate,Voters were happy to see a congenial tone from the candidates in the first and only vice-presidential debate.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"For Americans, Tuesday night's debate between vice-presidential contenders Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was a fresh opportunity to compare the two tickets.  But it was an especially important night for voters from the Midwest. Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump both chose running mates from the region, hoping to court votes in key states. The BBC spoke to seven Midwestern residents from across the political spectrum who saw Tuesday night's 90-minute debate as a welcome dose of civility, even if it didn't change their vote.   Latim was elated to see civility return to the debate stage last night, though he is still throwing his support behind Harris-Walz.  There were some grownups in the room last night. There was a little bit of respect for each other even though they were throwing punches.  That's different from what we witnessed in the presidential ones in June or last month.  I didn't think Tim Walz did as good as I was expecting him to, but JD Vance was a great debater.  The moment that really stuck out for me was when Walz talked about his son witnessing gun violence and how JD Vance responded I think that was quite impressive.  Jim, a life-long Republican, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but he says Vance could be a strong candidate in the future. Without hesitation, I 100% think that JD Vance won this debate. He did what he needed to do. He got the style points, but he also got the substantive points.  Tim Walz on the other hand seemed flustered, he seemed taken aback at times.  Vice-presidential debates don't usually add up to be that much of a big deal, but this one may be an exception.  This was the most substantive, policy-driven, most normal debate that we've seen in a long time in this country.  Shana's perspective on the election did not change, but she is more hopeful about the future of American politics. I did like the comradery that they seemed to show, they at least played nice. It looked like bipartisan politics is supposed to look.  Yes, there were times where it felt like they got a little heated and they may have talked over each other a little bit, but at the same time it didn't really dissolve into bickering.  There were times where they were able to admit they agreed with each other on issues.  It actually meant something at the end to see them shaking hands and chatting. It was striking to me.  Christina is leaning towards supporting the Harris-Walz ticket, but has voted for Trump in the past.  I enjoyed hearing from them both and the fact that they actually had a discussion and didn't just fight or call each other names.  I was happy they agreed when it came to gun violence and they both agreed to have a conversation about the issue.  When I was listening to these two, I was thinking we might actually be able to make progress.  This long-time Republican was impressed by Vance and the senator's performance reinforced his support for the Trump-Vance ticket.  I thought the two of them were civil in how they treated each other, which was a good thing to see.  JD Vance was accurate, factual and was very respectful and really unflappable.  This is a brilliant guy who has come from an extraordinarily modest upbringing.  Meanwhile, Walz was caught in multiple lies by the moderators.  The style of the two men was completely different and I thought Vance's far more favourable.  Kristin generally supports Democrats and plans to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket because she trusts them on abortion, which is a top issue for her.  Vance kept saying the names of the female moderators - Margaret, Norah - and it’s something I find men do in a condescending way. I found him smug, a bit condescending, and evasive.   Walz did fine enough, it doesn’t really affect my support of him and Kamala Harris. It was respectable that they agreed on some issues as problems and didn’t lean heavily into personal attacks. They did talk more about policy than I expected. Sainaga is voting in his second presidential election this cycle and thought last night's debate was close.  Vance is a smooth talker, but I knew that with his Yale background.  Overall, from a politeness perspective and a decent debate perspective, I give high marks.  Walz was struggling in the beginning. He has said before he is not a good debater, that is not his strength.  But by the end of it, I thought Walz had found his footing.  He definitely took Vance to task when it came to January 6.  I would say overall Walz won, but only by a whisker.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24315lrv18o,Germany's Scholz escapes far-right win in home state - exit polls,The chancellor's hopes of a second term are bolstered as his SPD is set to defeat the far right in Brandenburg.,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Germany's chancellor appears to have narrowly dodged humiliation after exit polls suggested his party has held off the far right in his home state. Olaf Scholz's centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) won Sunday's regional election in stronghold Brandenburg by just one or two percentage points, according to polls by the two main public broadcasters. Alternative for Germany (AfD) stood a chance of winning the state, which has been governed by the SPD since German reunification in 1990. But after voting ended at 18:00 (16:00 GMT), predictions put the SPD on 31 to 32% to the AfD's 29 to 30%. The election, on the outskirts of Berlin, was being watched closely after the AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War Two, in the eastern state of Thuringia, on 1 September.  The party also came a narrow second in Saxony on the same day. An AfD win in Sunday's election would have dealt a major blow to Scholz's hopes of a second term in Germany's federal elections next year.  It would also have been embarrassing, given he lives in the state's capital, Potsdam. Scholz has faced plummeting opinion polls and infighting in his embattled coalition government.  But about two million voters in Brandenburg may have given him a rare political lifeline. Dietmar Woidke, the state's popular SPD premier, has mostly shunned campaigning with Scholz and is critical of his ruling coalition's behaviour and policies. Scholz, meanwhile, called earlier this month on other parties to block the ""right-wing extremist"" AfD from office by maintaining a so-called firewall against it. He described the results in Thuringia and Saxony as ""bitter"" and ""worrying"". ""The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country's reputation,"" he said in a previous statement to Reuters. The AfD, officially classified “extremist” in some states, is unlikely to enter any regional governments because every other party has refused to work with it. Bolstered by youth support, it continues to capitalise on worries over an economic slowdown, immigration and the Ukraine war - concerns that resonate strongly in the formerly Communist eastern Germany. Its win with almost a third of the vote in Thuringia shocked the political establishment. It placed nine points ahead of the conservative CDU and far in front of Germany's three governing parties. The AfD is second in national opinion polls, with the federal elections only a year away. Co-leader Alice Weidel has claimed that ""without us, a stable government is no longer possible at all""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7jnvrr23po,'I'm feeling uneasy': First-time US voters reckon with high-stakes election,"With polls suggesting a tight race, people casting their ballots for their first time say they feel immense pressure.",5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"For millions of Americans, 5 November will be the first time they vote for president in a US election. With polling numbers showing a tight race, first-time voters say they're feeling immense pressure and reckoning with a strong partisan divide as they choose between former President Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris.  The BBC spoke to seven of them across the political spectrum about participating in a US election for the first time. We start with a voter who is scared by the level of partisanship that now colours US elections.  Denise participates in community outreach, urging young people to vote and to back the Harris-Walz ticket.  It's definitely disheartening to see how much hyper-partisanship has increased in the past couple of years. You can watch old presidential debate clips and you can see how cordial the candidates can be, and now you see a flip in politics. When you see that candidates are enticing their voters to be ""it’s either our side or their side"" - it’s almost ignorant, it’s not professional in any way and it’s not reflective of who our commander-in-chief is supposed to be.  I'm feeling uneasy because you would think that this would be an easy election. You would think that I wouldn't be scared of the outcome of this election because the outcomes are so night and day, but I am. Aleksei started paying attention to politics during the 2020 election and realised the power behind his planned vote for Trump.  I support Trump but I’m kind of dissatisfied with the way his campaign is running things. I feel like Kamala isn’t fit for the job and overall there’s been this feeling of both sides being very party-centric. Trump was an independent voice in 2016, it felt like he was running against the establishment of both parties. There’s no independent voice now and that’s demoralising to me. It makes me feel like it’s a return to this chaotic normalcy of two parties who both want to get us into wars and don’t care about the people of this country. Melina is eager to vote for a candidate who will focus on abortion access and climate change. She feels Harris is her best bet.  Going into the election, it's been very overwhelming. There’s a lot of information coming at me on social media especially.   Prior to Harris being nominated, I was still adamant about voting for Joe Biden because a lot of the rights I feel are important, I felt would be prioritised under a Biden administration. But I'm more proud now to stand behind Harris.  We could get to have our first female president. Lydia's number-one issue this election is abortion; she travels the country encouraging young people to vote for anti-abortion candidates and policies. I can't trust a candidate who refuses to protect the unborn child. If they can't protect preborn children, then I can't trust them to protect any of us. I'm voting for Trump as he is the most pro-life candidate and the most lives will be saved under him. This election is very heated and I definitely feel that. Being part of Gen Z, I know we're a target for both candidates. I've been focused on shifting our generation to vote pro-life first. Simon moved to the US from the UK in 2011 and says he previously supported Trump, but wasn't able to vote at the time. Since the 2016 election, everything seems to be way more divisive.  The one thing I miss about the UK system is the viable third party; right now you have left and right, and there’s very little in the middle. The divisiveness is pretty upsetting because I don't see the end of it.  At this stage I'm supporting Harris. There's very little about Trump I find appealing, certainly on a personal level and in terms of his policies there's nothing there that makes me think I would vote for him.  Devynn's interest in politics was sparked by seeing the 6 January riot at the Capitol. It's on her mind as she casts her first ballot.  My family has feelings opposite of mine when it comes to politics but I was always able to discuss things civilly.  Now it feels like we can’t have as many civil conversations and that’s not something I necessarily imagined. Trump is fuelling this divisiveness and the nastiness is somewhat supported by his policies.  Once he’s no longer within the candidate selection it won’t be as bad.  Alli has found this election cycle to be tense, but she feels strongly about casting her first ballot for Trump.  Even bringing up something about the election creates an argument with a lot of people. I'm voting for Trump in the fall because as much as I agree with his beliefs and policies, his capability of speaking and his charisma also draws me to him.  Both Trump and Vance have something that keeps me engaged with what they’re talking about.  I want my voice to be heard.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j7pd8ey3xo,VP debates rarely matter - the Walz v Vance showdown is different,"Trump has refused further debates with Harris, so their VP picks step in to sway voters in a tight race.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance will meet for their one and only vice-presidential debate on Tuesday night in New York City. While the stakes in these kind of running-mate face-offs are typically low – an undercard to the presidential main event - this one might be different. In a tight race that could be decided by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of states, every opportunity to generate positive attention and political momentum is precious. At the very least, the debate will be a fascinating contrast between two men with very different styles and political beliefs and two campaigns with distinct strategies for winning the White House. Donald Trump announced his selection of Vance back in July, at the start of the Republican National Convention and just a day after his near-assassination.  The former president was riding high in the polls, and his pick of the 40-year-old Ohio senator was viewed not only as a play to the white working class in the industrial Midwest – a key demographic in a region that is a top electoral battleground – but also as a way to establish his political legacy. Unlike Trump’s first vice-president, Mike Pence, Vance is an ideological kindred spirit, whose focus on trade and immigration match Trump’s top political priorities. If Vance was a front-runner to be Trump’s running-mate, Walz’s path to the Democratic number-two spot was considerably more unlikely. After Joe Biden abandoned his re-election bid, Vice-President Kamala Harris stepped in as the standard bearer and shortly thereafter began her ticket-mate search. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, was not a leading contender for the job, but his viral appearances on television, deriding Republicans as “weird”, and his ability to defend liberal policies in moderate-friendly language won Harris over. On the campaign trail, both men have sought to put the political skills that earned them the running-mate jobs to work. Vance is polished and practised – a former Silicon Valley venture capitalist with an Ivy League pedigree that belies his rural Appalachian roots. Walz is a high-school teacher turned politician with a penchant for folksy Midwestern humour. Vance has been a frequent advocate for the Trump campaign on mainstream media news programmes. He’s also rallied potential supporters in rural areas of the Midwestern battleground states, part of the Trump campaign’s strategy of engaging sympathetic voters who may not have participated in previous elections. Last week in Traverse City, Michigan, Vance gave his standard stump speech, which is focused on immigration, the economy and trade. “We’re going to pursue some commonsense tax and economic policies,” he told the crowd of a few thousand cheering supporters gathered in a local fair ground. “We will do it with American workers rather than foreign slave labourers.” While many of the rally attendees didn’t know much about Vance prior to his selection as candidate for vice-president, they said they liked what they had heard so far - even as Vance has frequently flirted with controversy. His amplification of untrue rumours that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating pets in Ohio is a recent example. The Democrat has been a regular fixture in more rural areas of the battleground states - often appearing in places that are traditionally more conservative. As a former high school football coach, he’s sought to play up his background and links to America’s most popular sport. On Saturday, he was at the Michigan-Minnesota college football game which was played in front of a crowd of 110,000. When Harris introduced Walz as her vice-presidential pick at a Philadelphia rally in early August, she repeatedly referred to him as “Coach Walz” - and highlighted his high-school teacher background. The Democrats may be hoping his plainspoken, salt-of-the-earth appeal could cut into the Republican margins outside major metropolitan areas. “In Minnesota, we respect our neighbours and their personal choices that they make,"" Walz said in Philadelphia. “Even if we wouldn’t make the same choice for ourselves, there’s a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.” During Tuesday night’s debate, Vance is likely to continue to hammer Democrats on the economy, immigration and crime – areas where polls show Trump and the Republicans are favoured.  He could accuse Walz of being slow to react to the sometimes violent demonstrations in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and highlight some of the more controversial liberal policies Walz enacted as governor, including around transgender rights.  He may also point to Walz’s sometimes contradictory statements about his record serving in the Minnesota National Guard. Walz may counter by highlighting Vance’s past controversial statements – on Ohio Haitians and his derisive remarks about Democratic women who don’t have children being “childless cat ladies”.  He may also note Vance’s connections to people who oversaw Project 2025, the proposed governing agenda advanced by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He is also sure to shift the focus onto the social issues where Democrats are stronger – such as healthcare, the environment and, most prominently, abortion rights. Both men had relatively low profiles in national politics prior to their elevation to their respective presidential tickets. Vance, who has served less than two years in the US Senate, is best known for best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. Walz has a longer political record, serving as governor and as a congressman from a rural area of Minnesota, but he was never in the top ranks of party leadership. The two will have the opportunity to introduce themselves to millions of Americans for the first time on Tuesday night – and their performance could reflect on the judgement and decision-making skill of the presidential nominees who selected them. The spotlight on Vance may be particularly sharp, given that Trump, if he wins, will be the oldest person ever elected president. Vance could also take the opportunity to provide ideological depth and detail to Trump’s conservative populism, as he did during his July Republican convention speech. For Walz, it’s a chance not only to help Americans learn more about him as a candidate, but about a Democratic ticket that did not exist two months ago – one that, according to polls, many Americans still are uncertain of. If he can do that in a way that appeals to moderate and independent voters – his touted strength – all the better for the Harris camp. Typically, the vice-presidential debate happens in the midst of a series of presidential debates – an interlude between the candidate showdowns that really matter. With no further presidential debates scheduled this year, however, the running-mate face-off could be the last chance for American voters to see the two tickets represented in direct contrast before they cast their ballots.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8mzgr300ko,Trudeau survives second parliamentary confidence vote,The prime minister's struggling Liberals are expected to face a series of votes aimed at toppling the government this autumn.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has survived a second non-confidence motion in parliament in as many weeks.  The motion, brought by the opposition Conservatives, was aimed at bringing down his minority Liberal government and triggering a federal election. The motion failed after Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre again fell short in his effort to gain the backing of other political parties in parliament. Poilievre tabled this second non-confidence motion the day after his last one failed.  This motion accused the government of failing Canadians on affordable housing, the cost of living, and crime - key issues that the Conservatives have been using to hammer the Liberals for months.  The vote needed the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass. After all the votes were counted, 121 voted for the motion while 207 voted against it.  In a statement following the vote, Poilievre blamed the NDP and the Bloc Québécois for its failure, saying the former had ""sold out working Canadians"" while the latter is ""letting down Quebecers"". The Bloc Québécois, which represents the interests of Quebec, Canada’s French-speaking province, had issued an ultimatum to the Liberals for its continued support.  The sovereigntist party gave the government a 29 October deadline to pass two bills, one increasing pensions for seniors and one to bolster protections on Canada's supply management system, which controls production quotas and imports on dairy and poultry products.  On Tuesday, it tabled its own motion calling on the Trudeau government to support their seniors' bill.  Meanwhile, the NDP leader Jagmeet Singh indicated last week that his party would not support the Conservative motion.  Several other non-confidence motions are expected to be tabled in the coming weeks, including a third that has been put forward by the Conservatives.  Trudeau has been Canada’s prime minister for nine years and has been facing growing pressure to resign over concerns he is a drag on his party's fortunes.  The Conservatives have been leading the Liberals by a wide margin in opinion surveys for months. His Liberal party lost two consequential by-elections this summer in Toronto and Montreal, both in strongholds previously held by the party for years.  A deal between the Liberal party and the NDP had helped Trudeau stay in power since Canada’s last federal election in 2021. The deal collapsed last month after Singh pulled out from the deal, saying that the Liberals are “too weak” to govern."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9j43890k7o,'He's just a bro': Trump's attempts to woo the 'manosphere',There's a huge gender divide in this election but will the young men Trump is courting go out and vote for him?,2 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has appeared on a slew of shows with huge audiences of young men, sitting for interviews with influencers, comedians and podcasters outside the usual political media. What’s his strategy? About 15 minutes into Donald Trump’s conversation with comedian Theo Von, the chat veered into territory not usually heard in a political speech. “I had a great brother who taught me a lesson, don’t drink. Don’t drink, and don’t smoke,” the former president said. “I admired so much about him… And he had a problem with alcohol.” “I’ve been in recovery for most of the past 10 years,” Von replied. “Drugs and alcohol.” Trump seemed genuinely interested. “Which is worse?” he asked. The pair went on to chat at length about addiction and the drugs industry. Politics wasn’t entirely absent - within a few minutes Trump was back alluding to his grievances against the “deep state” and the voting system - but the friendly chat was a prime example of a larger campaign strategy. Trump has done a series of interviews with podcasters and alternative media that together comprise a concerted effort to reach young men. Although the tactic isn’t new - for months, stretching back to last year, Trump has been appearing on alternative, male-dominated media outlets with big audiences - it’s taken on a greater importance in the final stages of this election. In August the Trump campaign told reporters that they are targeting a key group of voters that makes up just over a tenth of the electorate in swing states. They’re mostly younger men, and mostly white, but the group includes more Latinos and Asian-Americans than the general population. And they believe they can reach these often fickle voters by putting Trump on shows hosted by people like Von, internet pranksters Nelk Boys, YouTuber Logan Paul and Adin Ross, a livestreaming gamer who has repeatedly been banned from sites for violating rules on offensive language. The Nelk Boys are reportedly spearheading a voter registration drive on behalf of Trump which they hope will reach like-minded audiences. Although they may not exactly be household names in the world of mainstream media, these podcasts have audiences of millions. Von’s Trump interview has nearly 14 million views on YouTube. Polls indicate the political gender gap among young people has widened since Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee in July. Overall the vice-president seems to be pulling more young people into her camp - but her support among young women has risen faster than her support among young men. Recent research by the Harvard Youth Poll indicates 70% of women under age 30 support Harris, while 23% plan to vote for Trump. Among men in the same age group, 53% back Harris and 36% support Trump. Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life, part of the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, says that the political gender gap mirrors larger social divisions which have left many young men feeling like few politicians are looking out for them. “Trump is very good at turning things into zero-sum games,” Mr Cox says. “Young men are trying to understand their place in society that is rapidly evolving, as a group they are struggling more academically, they have mental health challenges and rising rates of suicide. “These are very real concerns and there’s a sense in the political realm that nobody’s advocating for them,” he said. But Trump’s podcast tour is not so much a question of policy, Mr Cox says, and more about “showing up” and talking with a different style to a different crowd. The attempt to switch up the vibe is apparent in his recent podcast interviews, where the mostly relaxed former president leads with chat about golf and mixed martial arts and Maga-world policies - Trump's Make America Great Again slogan that often refers to an America-first approach - are assumed to be good common sense rather than controversial topics to be picked apart and debated. Before the addiction chat on Von’s show, Trump praised Ultimate Fighting Championship competitors including Dustin Poirier, displaying more than a casual knowledge of the sport. “Boy, I'll tell you, he's a warrior,” Trump said, “The man he was fighting was tough… as that fight went along, he just got stronger and stronger.” Von did not push back - and in fact eagerly agreed - when Trump made a host of unsubstantiated and erroneous statements about voting, immigration and the border, including claiming that “hundreds of thousands of murderers” had entered the country. On the podcast circuit, there’s plenty of messing around, but sometimes the hosts seem awestruck, deferential or even nervous. Before one chat, the Nelk Boys videoed themselves chugging cans of their own-brand boozy seltzer to calm themselves down before Trump walked into the room. But their audiences aren’t demanding tough questioning or detailed policy positions. “A lot of young people are not looking for hard news,” says Mr Cox. “Their first interests might be crypto [currency] or video games, and the politics comes later - through the side door, not the front door.” There are other signs that Trump is making a hard pivot towards male voters - for instance filling the Republican National Convention stage with the likes of musician Kid Rock, wrestler Hulk Hogan and UFC chief executive Dana White, instead of being introduced - like he was at previous conventions - by his daughter, Ivanka. Judging from the comments on the podcast interviews, many viewers and listeners already back the former president, but getting them out to the polls may be the real challenge. Voting rates among young people lag behind overall, and young men tend to vote at slightly lower rates than young women.  The Harris campaign is also making a podcast play of its own, aimed at young women. The vice-president recently appeared on the popular sex-and-relationships pod Call Her Daddy, where she too faced less-than-aggressive questioning.  Garrett, a Logan Paul fan from Houston in his early 20s, runs his own YouTube channel under the name Spy Jay. He said he finds Paul’s brand - “being a Maverick” - appealing, and before watching the interview he had an overall positive view of Trump, calling him “a patriotic nationalist who wants to restore the country back to an improved state from before”. “But the persecution he's facing, while there's a relentless intention in the media to rewrite who he is and what he stands for, implies a greater evil at play,” he said. “And that makes me feel more inclined to be open-minded about voting for him.” Watching Trump on Paul’s podcast - the internet star asked Trump if he’d ever been in a fight - and Trump’s interview with Adin Ross, only confirmed his views, Garrett told the BBC. Garrett said he thought young Americans were increasingly tuning into politics, and that Trump is tapping into alt-media spaces “like no other candidate has before”. “So whether it's a good strategy or bad, it is going to reach quite a few of the young folks,” he said. Responses online to the video have been broadly positive. “No one can convince me Trump isn’t just a bro when it comes down to it” said one, while another read “Love or hate Trump, but he definitely knows how to make an interview entertaining”. But some experts question whether Trump has much room to grow his voting base among heavily male subcultures, where he has long had support. “Trump already seems to have captured the manospheric and hypermasculine over-25s, so this is a late stage and rather desperate attempt to become relevant,” said Jack Bratich, a media professor at Rutgers University who studies the male-heavy online spaces known as the “manosphere”. Extremely online young men were very active during the 2016 election campaign, when political memes and extreme message boards like 4chan burst into prominence, says Bratich. The situation is very different eight years later, he says, with “no identifiable right-wing youth-based online political movement” getting heavily involved in this year’s contest. However, he notes there is little risk and potentially large rewards for Trump. Whether it pays off will depend on convincing young men who don’t tend to get involved in politics to log off and head to the polls.  Like so many other things in this election, plays for younger voters are full of unknowns.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0ln0xy8q9o,Sigh of relief for Ghana's (not-so) new gender equality law,"After decades of stalling, the new law is warmly welcomed but some worry how well it will be enforced.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Women's rights advocates are demanding the immediate implementation of a nearly 30-year-old gender equity bill which Ghana’s president signed into law on Thursday. This ends a process which began in 1998, with the bill shuffling between parliaments until the legislature passed it in July this year. Many campaigners faulted Ghana’s law-making body for the long delay. Ghana now joins Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Mozambique and others in Africa that have working affirmative action laws. These countries have a 30% quota for women in decision-making bodies, in parliament and other state agencies. Ghana's Affirmative Action (Gender Equality) Act 2024 is expected to ensure a critical number of women hold key positions in government, security, commerce and other decision-making spaces. The law promotes the progressive and active participation of women in public life from a minimum of 30% to 50% by 2030, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal of achieving gender equality by 2030. The country’s trade unions are mandated by this law to ensure gender balanced representation on their executive boards, while private industries which enforce provisions of this law to employ women would benefit from tax incentives. After the law passed in July, Speaker of Parliament Alban Bagbin said he hoped lawmakers would commit to the reforms and “do more to create a free and just society to liberate more women to support us develop mother Ghana”. Subjecting an employee to gender-specific verbal attacks, stereotyping, hate speech or harsh rhetoric as well as discriminating against, intimidating or seeking to disqualify a candidate on grounds of gender are all banned under this law. Penalties include fines, and jail terms of between six and 12 months. Any act that victimizes, obstructs or exerts “undue influence on a person"" in a way that undermines the new law is deemed an offence. Trade unions who fail to comply could lose their registered status. Female lawmakers have described the law as a strong statement for the empowerment drive. Abla Dzifa Gomashie MP, whose constituency is in south-east Ghana, told the BBC she hoped it would “cure the cultural, political and economic discrimination against women and minority groups - especially that of the disability community.” “We must kick in the advocacy as soon as possible to ensure that state agencies and institutions get on board and educate the populace on the expectation that this law carries,” she added. But some advocates and activist groups who welcome the law worry that it will not be properly enforced. “In the midst of the joy, there are fears – we fear that for example where political parties are required to play a role, they may not necessarily do what they have to do,” Dinah Adiko, a technical consultant who previously worked with Ghana’s gender ministry, told the BBC. “We fear that the supervision of it, regulation... What are the biting powers to actively implement this law? Those are some of the reservations. But for the moment we are excited to see this come to light.” There has been little public criticism of the law. At a recent press conference, a journalist asked if ""pursuing equality by discriminating in favour of women"" was the wrong thing to do. But a senior minister dismissed that as a ""misconception about the bill fuelling tokenism"". ""Ghanaian women are qualified to hold positions of authority and influence,"" Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection Dakoa Newman told reporters. Many blamed both of Ghana's two main political parties - the NDC and the NPP - for failing to ensure passage of the law, despite repeatedly using it as a campaign promise. It was final re-introduced to parliament by current Gender Minister Newman earlier this year. Last year Ghana's parliamentary speaker said he wanted the bill to be passed but said it was not ready in its current form, and needed “critical stakeholder consultation for a well-defined and crafted law.” Recalling her stint as a technical advisor at the gender ministry in 2014,  Ms Adiko said: “We saw the bill all the way through to cabinet, got the approval until elections and the change in government in 2016 meant it went back several steps again.”  With the Ghana's general elections approaching in December, there are expectations that it could encourage more women to apply for political office. At present, two women have successfully submitted nomination forms for the presidency. One less than in the 2020 vote.  With this new law, the electoral commission is mandated to ensure political parties comply with quotas for women at various levels. The commission is also expected to “put measures in place to increase participation of women in the electoral process as candidates and voters”. Gomashie MP said she expected “political parties to engage vigorously in ensuring that they create spaces for our women to participate in electoral processes and also be able to contest in a free and fair environment”.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20j3428vyyo,"Bigots not welcome in Reform UK, says Nigel Farage","The Reform UK leader says the party needs to ""professionalise"" after winning its first MPs in July.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Nigel Farage has said ""bigots"" and ""extremists"" are not welcome in Reform UK, as he seeks to ""professionalise"" the party after its election success. Addressing its annual conference in Birmingham, the Reform UK leader said the party was ""coming of age"" after winning its first MPs in July. But he conceded the party had not been ""professional enough"" to properly vet candidates, following a series of controversies over their past comments. He added that the party represented the ""silent majority"" and could have won more seats, but that ""amateurism let us down"". Among proposed changes to make the party more professional, he said the party would be vetting candidates ""rigorously"" for all future elections. He added that they would also seek to emulate the Liberal Democrats by aiming to win more seats on councils to bolster its national electoral chances, with a target to win ""hundreds"" of seats in local polls next May. Reform UK, formerly known as the Brexit Party until the UK’s exit of the EU, won five seats at July's election, giving it a foothold in Parliament. Following its rebrand in 2021, it is aiming to become a permanent fixture on the right of British politics, with an emphasis on reducing immigration, tougher policies on crime and slashing taxes. Now, it is aiming to overhaul its party structures, as it seeks to use its election performance as a platform to build longer-term electoral success. Farage revealed ahead of the conference he would be giving up ownership of the party, which was set up as a private limited company to fast-track its creation ahead of the European Parliament elections in spring 2019. Addressing delegates, Farage said the initial structure had allowed the party not to be infiltrated by ""extremist groups"", adding that new political parties were often vulnerable to being ""hijacked"". He added: “We don’t want extremists, we don’t want bigots, we don’t want people who think that way, because we represent the silent, decent majority of this great country."" Around 4,000 activists are attending the party's gathering in the West Midlands, around four times as many as last year and its biggest yet. To the sound of Eminem's 2002 hit Without Me, which has become a familiar entrance tune for the Reform UK leader, Farage waved to activists as he lapped the auditorium at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre before his speech. Farage, who was elected as an MP in July at his eighth attempt, was watched by the party's other four MPs, including Lee Anderson, who sat on top of an open-top double decker bus inside the conference hall. In his address, he told activists he was on a mission to “professionalise and democratise” the party, having given it a ""beachhead"" in Parliament. He added the party would be ""vetting candidates rigorously at all levels,"" after dropping candidates during the general election following reports they had made offensive or racist comments. ""We haven't got time, we haven't got room for a few extremists to wreck the work of a party that now has 80,000 members and rising,"" he added.  ""We had the teenage tantrums which were those that caused us harm in the general election.  ""But we're now at a different point. The party is an adult, and this weekend, this weekend is when Reform UK comes of age."" Speaking to reporters after his speech, he said voters had punished the party for ""bad apples"" among its slate of candidates, adding the final few weeks of the election campaign had been a ""disaster"". Although party managers will undertake vetting, in a post-speech interview with the BBC, he pledged that local Reform UK associations will ""choose their own candidates"" for future elections. He added the branches would also be able to put new policies ""on the agenda to be debated"" at future conferences. A new draft constitution, to be put to a vote on Saturday, would see the party's board responsible, alongside the leader, for setting policy.  Motions approved by members would have to be debated within three months, but would only have ""advisory force"". "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylr0zx0jzo,Nigeria's ruling party wins first test since Tinubu elected,The election was seen as a test of the APC’s popularity given Nigeria’s economic troubles.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Nigeria's ruling party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), has won its first big electoral test since Bola Tinubu became president last year, despite the dire state of the country's economy. In the southern Edo state, which had previously been in the hands of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Monday Okpebholo defeated the PDP's Asue Ighodalo. He gained 291,667 votes against 247,274 for Ighodalo. However, the PDP has complained of fraud and vowed to challenge the result in court. ""The way these elections are going, they are probably going to be the worst elections in the history of this country,"" said PDP candidate Ighodalo. The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD-West Africa), which monitored the election, accused both the PDP and APC of vote-buying and also said election official had been intimidated in some areas. Although the PDP had previously been in power in Edo, the state has been in the hands of the APC for many years so its victory isn't necessarily a huge surprise. But given Nigeria's economic situation, some analysts had thought the APC could lose. The country is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation with annual inflation at 34% - the highest in almost three decades. Food prices have risen even faster - for example, in the commercial hub, Lagos, yams, a staple food, cost almost four times more than they did a year ago. Last month, massive protests were held across the country over the economic situation. Political analyst Muzammil Yakasai told the BBC that election violence had prevented some people from voting. “I don't think the election in itself is a reflection of how people in Edo state and Nigeria see the APC at the moment.” Another test awaits the APC in another governorship election in the south-western Ondo state in November.  Before his latest victory, he represented Edo Central as a senator at the National Assembly in an election he won last year. Born in 1970, Okpebholo, has a degree in Business Administration from the University of Abuja and a masters in policy and leadership studies from the same institution. Married with two children, the 54-year-old was charged earlier this year over allegations that he had falsified the date on his birth certificate.  He has not commented on the matter which is still in court. However, now that he's a governor, he has immunity from prosecution. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wndygyqgpo,Eswatini opposition leader poisoned in South Africa - party,The Pudemo party leader is among the organisers of pro-democracy protests planned for next month.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Eswatini’s main opposition leader has been poisoned as part of an assassination attempt and is being treated in hospital, his party says. Mlungisi Makhanya, 46, has been living in exile in neighbouring South Africa for the last two years, saying he fears for his life at home following a violent crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy. ""Our president has been stabilised but he is still in a critical condition,"" the People’s United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) said. Eswatini spokesman Alpheous Nxumalo denied state involvement, saying the ""government does not kill or poison suspects"". Pudemo says the attempt on its leader’s life comes ahead of planned protests next month calling for multi-party elections. The country, formerly known as Swaziland, allows independent candidates to stand for parliament but does not allow political parties to participate. King Mswati III has been on the throne since 1986 and rules by decree. He has been criticised for his extravagant lifestyle and is regularly accused of not allowing any dissent, which his government denies. Last year, Thulani Rudolf Maseko, a human rights lawyer, who was opposed to the king, was killed in his home in the capital, Mbabane, sparking widespread condemnation. In September 2022, Makhanya’s home in Eswatini was set alight in an alleged fire bomb attack by state agents. He now lives in South Africa’s capital, Pretoria, with his family. Makhanya leads Pudemo, one of the leading pro-democracy parties which are theoretically allowed, but banned from participating in elections. He was allegedly poisoned in the early hours of Tuesday inside his house in Pretoria by an unnamed ""young boy"", who Pudemo said was used as an ""agent of evil intent by Swazi government"".  Makwanya was rushed to a Pretoria hospital escorted by the South African police,  the Swaziland News website reported. He was later moved to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), in a critical but stable condition, it added.  He reportedly informed police and doctors that he had been poisoned and robbed of his cell phones. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Wandile Dludlu, the Pudemo deputy president, said an ""extremely dangerous and fatal"" pesticide poison was used in the incident.  ""It is encouraging that the president has survived a day,"" Dludlu added.  ""It was an assassination attempt on the life of our leader."" This was rejected by the Eswatini government. ""Government, through the law enforcement agencies - that adheres to a strict code of ethics and professionalism  - only apprehend suspects and bring them to Justice, and they are brought to justice 'alive', not 'dead',"" Nxumalo said in a statement. The Pudemo party has appealed for international support to ensure Makhanya's security and that of his family while in hospital. The Swaziland Solidarity Network (SSN), a group of Swazis living in South Africa, condemned what it termed a ""bold attack"" and a ""clear assassination attempt"" against Makhanya.  It called on the South African government to take action against Swazi state agents it said were targeting exiled pro-democracy activists ""fighting for freedom"" . Opposition parties have accused security agents of  killing dozens of protesters who have blamed the lack of development in the country on the current political system. In 2021, student-led protests that began over alleged police brutality morphed into calls for political change. At least 46 people died in a series of clashes between the security forces and demonstrators, according to Human Rights Watch. The government has disputed this figure and said that the police were responding to violent attacks. ""This is a political fight between the oppressed masses and the traditional autocratic monarch,"" Dludlu said, vowing that Pudemo would proceed with next month's protests as planned.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv2zvzvp90o,How both campaigns will seize on interest rate cut in US election,"With less than 50 days until the US election, Anthony Zurcher looks at how the rate cut will shape the presidential campaign.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Biden administration officials have been saying for months that the post-Covid surge in inflation is over. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve agreed. Given that the US central bank, and its chair Jerome Powell, pride themselves on making decisions removed from political influences and considerations, the move to decisively lower a key lending rate offers an impartial affirmation that inflation is now firmly under control and a top concern for economic policymakers is ensuring continued economic growth. Although most Americans would not be able to pick Mr Powell out of a crowd or explain the duties of the Federal Reserve, the interest rate change will shape media coverage of the US economy in the final two months of this presidential campaign. The larger-than-expected cut could also trigger another stock market boom and will lead to substantive drops in interest rates – on credit cards, car loans and, indirectly, home mortgages – that will be felt by consumers across the nation. All of that is good news for Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, given that voter concern about the economy have weighed on the electoral prospects for the incumbent vice-president and, before he abandoned his re-election bid, President Joe Biden. Since entering the presidential race in July, Harris has walked a fine line, attempting to take credit for the Democratic administration’s successes while also distancing herself from the negative perceptions many voters have of Biden’s economic stewardship. Wednesday's Fed move will help make that political dance an easier one for her. Expect Donald Trump to condemn the move as a partisan attempt to influence November’s election, while also pointing to the concerns the Fed has about rising unemployment and sagging economic growth of late.  He has criticised the central bank and its leadership in the past, and if he is re-elected, he may be even more inclined now to make a move to bring the quasi-governmental agency more directly under presidential influence. There are a handful of economic reports – on unemployment and economic growth – set to be released in the weeks ahead that will provide one final snapshot of the US economy as voters cast their ballots. But those will be a reflection of the state of affairs in the country. Wednesday's interest-rate announcement is different. It will shape America’s economic path for months to come."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xejx07exro,Michigan Arab-Americans 'can't stomach' Harris stance on Gaza,Arab-American voters in swing states like Michigan could decide who wins the US presidential election,21 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"At the Sahara Restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan, four Arabic language TV news channels are beaming in images of the war in Gaza and the aftermath of the recent  pager and radio devices explosions in Lebanon.  The smell of cardamom-infused coffee and shawarma and falafel, and hum of friends catching up, stand in stark contrast to the images on the television screens. Dearborn is the first Arab-majority city in the US, and it has served as a key centre for the ""uncommitted"" movement that is opposed to the Biden administration's policy toward the Middle East.  Because they are in Michigan - a key Midwestern swing state that Joe Biden won by fewer than three points in 2020 - Dearborn voters, like those who frequent the Sahara Restaurant, could decide Kamala Harris's political future.  Sam Hammoud, whose family has run the Sahara Restaurant in Dearborn for the past 30 years, said that taxes and inflation have negatively affected his business - but it's not what is motivating his vote. He is currently an undecided voter.  “It’s about the situation in our homelands,” he said. “We need a ceasefire. There is no ceasefire. We have no more words,” he added.  Mr Hammoud's feelings are shared by many here, and the Arab-American community has been sounding the alarm bell to Democrats for months, warning the party that its loyal support could not be automatically counted on this election. In a statement this week, the Uncommitted Movement - which is made up of traditionally Democratic members - said it could not endorse Harris because of her “unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing US and international human rights law”.  Soujoud Hamade is a lawyer in the Detroit suburb and president of the Michigan Chapter of the Arab American Bar Association.  She canvassed for the Democratic Party in past elections, and feels her work helped get President Biden elected in 2020. He won Michigan with a margin of just 2.78%. This time around, Ms Hamade is voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. She is not alone. An August poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations indicates that in Michigan, 40% of Muslim voters back Stein, 18% preferred Republican Donald Trump - and only 12% supported Harris - suggesting a significant shift from past strong support for Democrats.  Ms Hamade said the ""traditionally"" Democratic Arab-American voters in Michigan “cannot stomach the thought of voting for someone who's directly contributing to the death and destruction of our home country and of our relatives overseas”.  Harris welcoming the endorsement of former Republican Vice-President Dick Cheney was particularly troubling for the Michigan lawyer. She said Cheney’s involvement in the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 makes him an unwanted bedfellow for her community. “It's baffling to me as an American, to now see the direction that the party is going, it's disheartening,"" she said.  ""These aren't the values that we as Democrats stood for. We were not the party of war."" Packed full of cafes, restaurants and independently owned stores, Dearborn enjoys a thriving small-business economy - as well as a strong community that is deeply affected by the conflict in the Middle East.  Dr Maisa Hider-Beidoun, who owns a chain of pharmacies and medical centres in the region, said she is a lifelong Democrat who does not know if she can support Harris.  Her community has been placed in ""a moral dilemma”, she said. “We are good Americas, we are good tax-paying, law-abiding citizens, but our money is being funnelled overseas and killing people that are actually physically related to us.""  In February's Democratic primary in Michigan, part of the process of choosing the party's presidential candidate, over 100,000 people in this community declared themselves ""uncommitted"" in protest at the Biden-Harris administration policy towards Gaza.  The community says it has sought meetings with the White House and asked the vice-president to outline how her approach to Israel might differ from Biden's.  While the Uncommitted Movement criticised Harris, it also opposes Trump, whose “agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organising”, it says. The organisation did not recommend its members vote for a third-party candidate like Stein. While Trump has been critical at times of Israel's handling of the war, he has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel. He has condemned pro-Palestinian protests and as president, angered Palestinians by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. He has said the war would not have happened if he were president but has said little on his plans to end the conflict.  Dr Mona Mawari, a pharmacist and a community organiser who worked on the uncommitted campaign, told the BBC she is still struggling to decide how to vote in November - “a really hard decision”.  Harris is “maybe a little more empathetic with her words” than Biden regarding what Dr Mawari describes as “genocide” in Gaza, but she finds it hard to support her. Harris has said she is aligned with Biden on US support for Israel though she has spoken more about the scale of the human suffering in Gaza.  Said Dr Mawari: “The community is really upset, and they're very hyper-aware that lip service is just lip service, and without any actions they can't vote for her.""  The situation in Lebanon has also sharpened fears about an escalation in the regional conflict and, for this Arab-American community, what it means for their families there.  Faye Nemer came to the US when she was 10, fleeing Lebanon because of the political instability and violence, and she is now the CEO of the Middle East North American Arab Chamber of Commerce. Before her family left Lebanon, she says they were “living as refugees” in their own country, moving between “abandoned office buildings”.  So she looks at the situation in Gaza - where more than a million people have been displaced - through a different lens, particularly the experience of children.  Her sister and much of her extended family are still in Lebanon.  “It's difficult to conduct your day-to-day without that being top of mind,” she said.  A lifelong Democrat, she has also not made up her mind on how - or if - she will vote, and is also weighing voting for a third-party candidate. Some 3.5 million Americans claimed Middle Eastern descent in the 2020 Census -around 1% of the population, though many are concentrated in battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Dr Mawari said the uncommitted movement doesn't want people to feel apathetic and not cast a ballot, but to use their vote in whichever way they believe is right.  ""Sitting this one out is not an option. It's not an answer to what's going on,” she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vknnwggdzo,South Sudan’s president sacks his powerful spy chief,"Gen Akol Koor Kuc has been moved to become governor of Warrup State, where insecurity is rife.",3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir has sacked his powerful and long-serving spy chief Gen Akol Koor Kuc. He became head of the feared National Security Services (NSS) after independence in 2011 and continued throughout the bitter civil war that followed. No reason was given in the presidential decree that announced his removal, which was read out on national TV on Wednesday night - but he has been made governor of the president’s home state of Warrup, where insecurity is rife. Analysts say it may signal a power-struggle in Kiir's inner circle - with some believing Gen Kuc may be being lined up to one day take over from the 73-year-old president. It is not known how old the former spy is - but he is believed to be in his late 50s or early 60s. The shake-up at the NSS come weeks after it was announced that long-delayed elections, due to take place in December, had been postponed by two years. While some see Gen Kuc’s appointment to governor as a demotion, others believe the move may also help quell the violence in Warrup State. It is one of South Sudan’s conflict hotspots, which still sees fighting between rival ethnic communities despite the 2018 peace agreement to end the civil war. A job as governor would also give Gen Kuc experience in a civilian role, which some believe may be a way of preparing him for political life. This week has seen violence in Warrup's Tonj North county - with revenge attacks leaving at least 20 civilians dead and 37 others injured, the Netherlands-based Radio Tamazuj quoted the local authorities as saying. Sources told the BBC that major roads leading to the village of Akok in Tonj North were still blocked by heavily armed young men on Wednesday. Gen Kuc’s replacement at the NSS is Gen Akec Tong Aleu - moving from a position in the defence ministry. Under Gen Kuc’s leadership, the NSS has come in for fierce criticism from human rights groups. It is known for cracking down on opposition voices - including activists and journalists, with waves of arbitrary arrests and other alleged abusive practices. It denies allegations of abuse. Oil-rich South Sudan became the world’s newest country 13 years ago after seceding from Sudan - but it was then engulfed by civil war after Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar fell out. After five years of fighting, they signed a power-sharing agreement, which has been fraught with problems. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dvrrk9375o,Young Conservatives fighting to change their party,The Conservative Party has a youth problem - how do its young activists plan to solve it?,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It's not every day you bump into a Churchill at the Conservative Party conference. Henry Churchill, a 17-year-old distant relative of the former prime minister Sir Winston, is a member of another rare group - young Conservative supporters. There are plenty of them here in Birmingham, of course, but Henry thinks there should be more. He is calling on the party to ""tap into"" the growing right-wing youth movements in Europe. Compared to a rightward swing among young voters in Italy, Germany, Austria and Spain, there is an apathy for the Conservatives among his peer group. In the UK “most people my age are either voting for Reform or Labour”, says Henry, who is Sir Winston's fifth cousin four times removed. He says his contemporaries believe the Tory Party is “filled with a bunch of old people trying to make themselves richer”. But they’re wrong, Henry argues. “The Conservatives can offer people better opportunities to get on and get out into the world - get a good job and start earning money."" Recent European elections show a rightward trend among young voters. Meanwhile YouGov data shows the share of the under 25s vote for the Conservatives crashed from 21% in 2019 to just 8% at the last election. In 2024, more under 25s voted for Reform UK - they won 9% of the under 25s vote share. Labour won 41% of the share of the vote, according to the same survey, with the Liberal Democrats on 16% and the Greens on 18%. Aayaan Jafferi, an 18-year-old Conservative-leaning student from Dudley, argues that unlike other countries ""the right in the UK can't communicate properly with the young"". ""In other countries like the US, you have figures like [Republican vice presidential nominee] JD Vance,"" according to Aayaan. ""I'm not saying they're lovely people, but they can communicate to every age really,"" Aayaan says. Speeches by Rishi Sunak and other senior Tories are not getting young people ""excited enough to get jumping off their chairs to listen to them speak,"" he argues. The urgent need to win young voters has been a theme at this year's Conservative Party Conference.  Former Tory minister Grant Shapps told the conference, many people who voted Conservative this year won't do so at the next election ""because they will be dead"". But the party has ""their work cut out for them"" according to 20-year-old Tory activist George Pattenden. ""Back in school there was a natural left-wing leaning to the youth,"" George says. On top of this the Conservatives have to accept ""we’re just not that enthusiastic as a nation"" which is why ""youth turnout is quite low"", he argues. ""It is hard to get young people to do anything,"" he says. He says he ""understands the apathy,"" as politics is not mandatory in schools, leading many to avoid political debate. ""I'd say it is very unlikely that our generation turns right now,"" Aayaan Jafferi says. ""Because of social media, we have been kind of trained to think Conservatives bad, Labour good,"" he adds. Unless the Conservatives ""have a radical change"" and start offering young people policies to get them housing and starting young families ""we're stuck in this left-wing ideology for young people"". Milan, 17, a classmate of Jafferi's, says ""growing up under Tory rule has shifted people's minds against Conservatives"". ""I think the same thing would have happen if it was 10 years of Labour as well,"" she adds. In Europe, countries have ""had more left wing or centrist parties in power"" so the anti-establishment vote is ""going right"", another 17-year-old Young Conservative told me. He argues the British are not as rebellious as people in other parts of Europe. ""Just look at our history, we've not had revolution for 400 years - it is ingrained in us to be more civil."" Josh, 21, a member of the Young Conservatives, predicts ""right-wing support will eventually grow"" among his generation - but ""not for a good reason"". The UK is only a ""few years behind Germany and Italy"" in the rise of anti-establishment right-wing movements. ""Brexit relieved some of that right-wing pressure out of the UK,"" Josh argues. ""When people see mainstream centrist parties not delivering and not being true to their word on things like immigration"" people his age will eventually turn to more to the right. Though rare, young voices at the conference agree the party needs to change to win back young voters.  The real question is whether the party is ready."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw84kv9q8yo,"After a decade, Kashmir to vote in historic elections",This is the first assembly election since PM Modi's government revoked Kashmir's special status in 2019.,16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"On a bright September afternoon, a caravan of colourful cars, festooned with  flags, arrives at a village in Indian-administered Kashmir for an election rally. Iltija Mufti, a politician from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), slowly rises from the sunroof of one of the cars. “Yeli ye Mufti (When Mufti will be in power),"" she shouts at a crowd that has gathered to hear the third-generation leader of one of the most influential political dynasties of the region. “Teli Tch’le Sakhti (Then the repression will end),"" they respond in unison. From a distance, army personnel in bulletproof jackets, armed with automatic rifles, stand watch, tracking every movement. For the first time in a decade, elections are being held in 47 assembly seats of Kashmir, long marked by violence and unrest. The region, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the cause of three wars between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Since the 1990s, an armed insurgency against Indian rule has claimed thousands of lives, including civilians and security forces. The three-phase polls will also extend to the 43 seats in the neighbouring Hindu-majority Jammu region. The election is the first since 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy, stripped its statehood, and split it into two federally-administered territories. Since then, the region has been governed by a federal administrator. In the fray are 13 main parties vying for a majority in the 90-seat assembly.  The major players are the two main regional parties - the PDP led by Mehbooba Mufti and the National Conference (NC) which is headed by Omar Abdullah. Both Mufti and Abdullah are former chief ministers of the region.  The NC has formed an alliance with India's main opposition party Congress. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also contesting but not many are betting on the party, which has a stronghold in Jammu but a weak political base in the valley. In the last elections in 2014, the BJP had formed a government in alliance with PDP after sweeping Jammu. The alliance fell apart in 2018 after years of disagreements.  Also in the picture, this time, is Engineer Rashid - a controversial politician who has spent five years in jail accused in a terror case and was released on bail this week. Rashid came to limelight earlier this year when he pulled off a stunning victory in the general election over Abdullah. He fought the election from jail, with his sons leading an emotional campaign on the ground. Elections in Kashmir have long been contentious, with residents and separatist leaders often boycotting them, viewing the process as Delhi's attempt to legitimise its control.  Since 1947, Kashmir has held 12 assembly elections, but voter turnout has often been low and marked by violence. Militants have attacked polling stations, and security forces have been accused of forcing voters to come out and vote. Since the 1990s, hundreds of political workers have been kidnapped or killed by militant groups. But for the first time in decades, even separatist leaders are contesting in several seats. The most keenly watched of these is the outlawed Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) party, which has joined hands with Rashid's Awami Ittehad Party (AIP).  Residents will vote to elect a local assembly, led by a chief minister and council of ministers. Though the assembly will have limited powers under Delhi's rule, it has sparked hopes for a political change in the valley. Almost all opposition parties have pledged to restore statehood and the region's special status. The BJP has ruled out restoring autonomy but has promised to reinstate statehood to Jammu and Kashmir ""at an appropriate time after the elections"". Most residents appeared to be reconciled to the loss of their region's autonomy. “I don’t think Article 370 will come back unless any miracle happens,” said Suheel Mir, a research scholar, adding that parties were making promises about restoring autonomy in a “politically charged” atmosphere to get votes. Several young men and women said they were more concerned about issues like political instability, corruption and most of all, unemployment -  also a major concern in Jammu.  “We want to cast our vote to resolve our day-to-day issues. It has nothing to do with the Kashmir dispute,” said a man who did not wish to be named. But others said they didn't want to give the impression that they had accepted the events of 2019 and would participate in the election solely to vote against the BJP. ""We want to send a message to the government that the revocation is unacceptable to us no matter what,"" said 38-year-old Zameer Ahmad. Five years ago when Modi's government abrogated Article 370, the 70-year-old constitutional provision that gave the region its autonomy, the government said it was necessary to restore normalcy in India’s only Muslim-majority region.  The move triggered a severe security clampdown, mass detentions, curfews and a months-long internet blackout, stripping residents of rights to jobs and land.  Since then, Modi and his ministers have extensively talked about a new era of peace and development in Kashmir, announcing projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars that they say are part of a plan to integrate the region's economy with the rest of India. (Until Jammu and Kashmir's special status was removed, outsiders could not buy land to do business there). But locals say they have yet to see the benefits of such projects and continue to struggle with violence and high levels of unemployment.  Thousands of Indian army troops continue to be perpetually deployed there, with powers that have led to decades of allegations of human rights violations.  ""There is an absence of democracy and freedoms in Kashmir and many political activists remain in jail,"" said political scientist Noor Ahmad Baba. ""The election allows people to give their verdict for or against these changes."" The change in mood is visible everywhere. Across Jammu and Kashmir, streets are adorned with posters, party flags, and billboards and men at local bakeries freely discuss election outcomes over chai.  ""There has been a complete overhaul of traditional political narratives,"" said Tooba Punjabi, a researcher. ""Earlier, public boycotts defined elections. But now, it's a means of putting the right party in place to undo damage."" The shift in political attitudes was also evident earlier this year, when Kashmir registered a historic 58.46% voter turnout in the parliamentary election. Many residents are now pinning their hopes on regional parties to raise their demands.  ""These parties have acted as a shield between Delhi and Kashmir,"" said businessman Tahir Hussain,"" adding that ""it didn't matter who will form the government as long as it's a local one"". Analysts say the BJP's performance could also receive a significant blow in Jammu this time, where internal discord and infighting has derailed its ambitions. There's also growing anger among the residents who are unhappy with the party's policies. Until now, the BJP's push for development has resonated with people in Jammu who hope it would bring in more economic opportunities for them. But many say they are yet to see any signs of change. “In fact, now that Article 370 has been scrapped, people from other states are coming to Jammu. Our rights on jobs and land are being taken away from us,"" said Gulchain Singh Charak, a local politician. Sunil Sethi, BJP's chief spokesperson in the region, rejected the allegations. “We have done massive infrastructure developments, build roads and brought foreign investors here,” he said. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3zxk9w955o,Melania Trump is latest Republican First Lady to back abortion,"Her apparent support of abortion access puts her at odds with her husband, who has taken credit for helping to overturn Roe v Wade.",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Melania Trump seems to have joined a long line of Republican former first ladies who have come out in support of abortion rights, putting them at odds with their husbands' public views.  In a short video clip promoting her forthcoming book, Mrs Trump expressed her support for women's ""individual freedom"", describing it as an ""essential right that all women possess from birth"". It comes a day after an excerpt of her soon-to-be-released memoir, in which she reportedly takes an even clearer pro-choice stance, was published in a newspaper report. Mrs Trump's apparent stance on the issue appears to contrast with the position of her husband, who has taken credit for helping overturn Roe v Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion. But it follows a decades-long American tradition of Republican first ladies who - since Roe v Wade was first decided in 1973 - have said legal abortion access should be protected.  In 1975, while still in the White House, First Lady Betty Ford called the Roe ruling a ""great, great decision"". Nancy Reagan waited until her husband, President Ronald Reagan, left office before she said publicly that she ""believed in a woman's choice"", but her position on the issue was reportedly well known within the White House.  Barbara Bush, wife of President George HW Bush, and her daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, wife of President George W Bush, were similar, revealing their stance on the issue after their husbands left the White House.  ""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons,"" Laura Bush said in a 2010 interview promoting her memoir.  Mrs Trump's approach was different.  In a black-and-white video posted on her X account on Thursday, Mrs Trump said ""there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom"".  ""What does my body, my choice really mean?"" Mrs Trump continued.   The video comes one day after The Guardian published an excerpt from her new book, Melania, set to be released on 8 October. In the excerpt, quoted by the Guardian, she writes: “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government."" “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,"" she continues. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. ""I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of the book First Women, said she was ""shocked"" by the comments. ""So shocked that I wanted to check it was real,"" she said. ""She's very much been in line with her husband, so on this issue how did she spend all those years watching him derail something that she seems to care about?"" More than the other first ladies, Ms Brower said, Mrs Trump's comments appear ""diametrically opposed"" to her husband's approach on the issue. And she is the only first lady so far to make her stance on abortion known while her husband is actively seeking re-election.  Indeed, the timing of Mrs Trump's comments suggest a possible political angle, Ms Brower said.  ""It's not out of the realm of possibility that this was done intentionally to come out right before the election, because it could appeal to those swing state voters who are upset about the overturning of Roe v Wade,"" she said. ""Maybe they could see this as a sign that he [Trump] perhaps is softening on abortion.""  But Republican strategist Rina Shah offered a different view. The notion of Mrs Trump trying to help out her husband ""doesn’t track with the Melania we know"", she said.  ""At this point in the game it doesn’t change anything, and she knows that,"" Ms Shah said. ""Early ballots have already gone out in certain places. It’s just too late."" Abortion access is a key issue in next month's 2024 election - and it is considered a weak point for the Republican Party, which has struggled to appeal to a conservative base that opposes the procedure and a wider electorate that supports abortion access.  Throughout the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump's position on the issue has fluctuated.  Earlier this week, the Republican presidential nominee said for the first time that he would veto any federal abortion ban in the unlikely event that such a measure ever passed Congress. The BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment.  Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has sought to capitalise on Trump's position in an effort to galvanise voters.  She has regularly cast Trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of the overturning of Roe v Wade, which took place after he appointed a conservative majority to the Supreme Court. “Sadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump’s husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,"" Sarafina Chitika, a spokeswoman for the Harris-Walz campaign told the BBC.

The percentage of its net budget that is spent on social care has increased from 58% to 74% over the last six years, and the number of children in council care has risen by more than 80% since 2020. The council, like all other local authorities across the country, has also been impacted by inflation and a consequent hike in the cost of providing services since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. All non-statutory services are being reviewed to find savings, and as departments shrink, 540 full-time posts need to be axed. ""Of course the staff are worried, we're all worried"", said the Conservative council leader, who has held the role since 2021. ""We're all really upset about people having to lose their jobs, but we have to make these changes."" Although councils are not technically subject to bankruptcy, if they cannot balance the budget they must issue a section 114 notice, which limits their activities and can lead to government intervention as in Birmingham. When asked if she thought Shropshire Council could see out this financial year without such a declaration, Picton could not give an answer. ""We are so desperate to make these savings so the council will continue for the future. ""I will do everything in my power to financially survive, but I can't say one way or the other whether that's possible."" Opposition parties have agreed that Shropshire Council needs more money, but have accused the authority of not doing enough to find savings. Liberal Democrat co-leader, Roger Evans, said the current administration had chosen not to invest in areas that would generate extra income, such as placing solar panels on more council buildings or changing to LED street lighting when first recommended in 2017, a potential saving of around £1m a year. And Labour group leader Rosemary Dartnall said the council had ""been too slow in grasping the scale of the problem"". The leader of the largest union at Shropshire Council is very concerned about the future of local government. Unison branch secretary, Ash Silverstone, said more councils ""will go under"" unless  council financing was addressed. ""Without local government, society is going to start to fall apart,"" he said. ""We're at a tipping point now... are we going to see libraries closed? Are we going to see the end of leisure facilities and theatres? Are we going to see potholes not being fixed? ""Who wants to live in a society like that? I know I don't."" Follow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7481gy3kg9o,"I'd have done better than Sunak in election, says Truss",The former PM tells a packed hall what she thinks of her Tory predecessors and the MPs vying to be the next leader.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Liz Truss has said she would have done better than Rishi Sunak at the general election if she had still been Conservative leader. Truss was forced to stand down as prime minister in 2022, after just 45 days when her ""mini budget"" triggered a market meltdown. Asked at a Tory conference event if she would have done better than Sunak, who led the party to the biggest election defeat in its history in July, she said: ""Yes I do.""  But she went on to say that it would still have been a ""tall order"" to win, adding that the party ""should have kept Boris"". ""If the mini-budget had been allowed to succeed” then voters would have looked more kindly on the Conservatives, she argued, but it was ""difficult"" to get the changes she wanted through without the support of Tory MPs. The former prime minister said she would not endorse any of the four contenders vying for the Tory leadership - Kemi Badenoch, Robert Jenrick, Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly. “So far I haven’t seen any of the candidates really acknowledge how bad things are in the country as a whole and frankly for the Conservative Party.  ""I think there’s a bit of Panglossian [thinking that] all we need to do is unite, all we need to do is show competence and we’ll be ushered back into office”. She urged candidates to think more radically about policies like expanding fracking and coal power, and abolishing the Human Rights Act and the Equality Act, arguing that Britain was now a ""socialist country"", thanks in part to previous Conservative governments. The packed auditorium listened largely in silence, but broke into applause and cheering when Truss said a Donald Trump victory in the US elections ""would really cheer me up"". She was quizzed by The Telegraph's Tim Stanley about how she managed to keep going in the face of rejection by voters, attacks from critics and ridicule by comedians. She denied lacking a sense of humour, but said jokes about her from ""left wing"" comics were ""just not funny"" as they were ""in power"" as part of the liberal establishment she was fighting against. Explaining that she was on a mission to save ""not just Britain but Western civilization"", she added: ""I enjoy the fight."" Did she ever feel like throwing the towel in and doing whatever makes her happy? she was asked. ""This is what I do to be happy,"" she told the crowd. She said that she had lost her own, previously safe, Norfolk seat in the general election because of Reform UK’s strong performance, but added: “I don’t believe the people of South West Norfolk actually consciously want a Labour MP.” When Tim Stanley asked the crowd if they wanted to see Truss back in Parliament, many hands shot up. She did not rule out a return to the Commons, but said she was still considering what to do next.  She got another round of applause when she attacked the British media for not giving enough scrutiny to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey. “Conservatives won’t succeed until we get rid of the Office for Budget Responsibility,” she said, before accusing the Bank of England of seeking to “blame their mistakes on me”. She argued that the “new divide in British politics” is between “the establishment”, which includes institutions like the bank - and the BBC - but also the former prime minister Theresa May, the current chancellor Rachel Reeves - “both former employees of the Bank of England” - and senior bureaucrats."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glxxreed7o,What latest FBI data shows about violent crime,BBC Verify looks at violent crime rates in the US following the release of new data from the FBI.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Violent crime is one of the key issues in the US election, with research suggesting that many Americans believe it is on the rise. But the latest FBI crime data shows it fell last year. The much-anticipated report, released on Monday, shows declines across several serious crimes including rape, robbery and aggravated assault.  The number of murders saw the largest drop in 20 years, according to the FBI.  Violent crime - as recorded by the FBI - includes homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault reported to and recorded by police forces.  Its latest report shows that violent crime fell by an estimated 3% between 2022 and 2023. Murder and non-negligent manslaughter reduced by 12%, the largest drop in the last 20 years. The report also shows falls in: In 2023, the FBI recorded a rate of 363.8 violent crimes per 100,000 people, down from the 2022 rate of 377.1 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Reported violent crime has fallen year-on-year since 2020.  But while violent crime is down, some non-violent crimes are up. In 2023, motor vehicle theft rose by 13%. Submitting data to the FBI is voluntary and in recent years some police forces have not done this.  In 2021, the participation rate was around two thirds because many agencies - including in New York and Los Angeles - did not submit data to a new FBI system. Donald Trump regularly criticises the FBI data and his website says it “is missing nearly a third of the nation's law enforcement agencies — including from many of the most violent cities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and New Orleans”. But participation has steadily improved and in 2023 more than 85% of agencies enrolled in the FBI's data collection system submitted figures. The FBI says every city agency covering a population of one million or more residents contributed a full 12 months of data in 2023. Daniel Flannery, a professor specialising in violence prevention research, says that generally it is the smaller agencies that do not submit data. “Many of them don’t have their own data people. Suburban and and rural communities tend to be the ones not submitting the data because they lack resources,” he says. The other way of tracking US violent crime is through a nationwide survey of about a quarter of a million people. The National Crime Victimization Survey asks them whether they have been victims of crime and whether they reported these offences to the police (in 2023, only around half of them did). Violent crime, as recorded by the survey, includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. It does not count murder. Donald Trump regularly highlights this survey as proof that “violent crime nationwide is up 40%” since 2020. This figure is right, according to the latest crime survey statistics.  They show that the rate of violent crime per 1,000 of the population did increase by this much between 2020 and 2023.  However, Trump is making a comparison with a year when violent crime - as measured by the survey - was significantly lower.   Prof Flannery says “picking a year during Covid that may represent the lowest crime rates then comparing to a more 'return to normal year' cherry picks two points in time. Comparing 2023 to a pre-Covid year may be more appropriate.” The survey says that “while the 2023 rate was higher than those in 2020 and 2021, it was not statistically different from five years ago, in 2019”. Both of the main data sources show violent crime has fallen in the past three decades. FBI data shows a 49% reduction in the rate of violent crime between 1993 and 2022, with large decreases in the rates of robbery (down 74%) and murder (down 34%), according to analysis by the Pew Research Center. Likewise, the victims’ survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows a 71% decline over the same period. On the reduction in violent crime, Prof Flannery says it’s “partly because we’re getting better at understanding what drives violent crime, which tends to be a small number of people in a community committing repeat offences. It’s also about targeted policing strategy and intervention.” Marc Levin, Chief Policy Counsel at the Council on Criminal Justice, says that other factors may be influential in bringing crime levels down. “We don’t know all the reasons crime fluctuates but some of it is obviously demographic. We’re an aging society which generally speaking should lead to less crime. “There are also environmental factors like streetlighting which help with crime prevention. Evidence suggests it makes the potential perpetrators of crimes like robbery and auto-theft believe they’re going to be caught,” he argues. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

The upgrades to the A12 in east Suffolk, which links the county's two biggest towns of Lowestoft and Ipswich, include improving the A14 Seven Hills junction and the A1152 Woods Lane in Melton. Suffolk County Council said the road was a ""key route"" and improvements would ""improve conditions for all road users"".  A public consultation on the plans is open until 29 October. The project was given £54m in government funding last year.  The scheme will include a new dual carriageway at Seckford Hall, between the B1438 and B1079.  An overbridge at Martlesham Heath would also be widened as part of the plans. Chris Chambers, Suffolk County Council's cabinet member for transport strategy, planning and waste, said the scheme would provide ""major benefits"".  He said: ""These improvements will provide greater access to the east coast, an area with several Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) including Sizewell C, easing congestion and network disruption during its construction. ""I encourage residents to take a look at the plans, read up on the benefits and let us know their thoughts."" In person consultation events are being held in Woodbridge and Martlesham at the end of the month.  Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70w909znl6o,"Time stood still, Trump says at site of assassination attempt",Donald Trump invited tech billionaire Elon Musk to the stage to join him attacking his Democratic opponent.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Nearly three months after an assassin’s bullet came close to taking his life, former President Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania - a place of ""tragedy and heartache"" - to promise his supporters victory in the 5 November presidential election. One person - a volunteer fire chief - was killed in the 13 July shooting, which also left two bystanders seriously wounded and Trump shot in the ear. “For 15 seconds, time stood still,” Trump told the crowd. “This vicious monster unleashed evil… the villain did not succeed in his goal.” For Saturday's rally, though, security was tight - a result of increased scrutiny of the Secret Service in the wake of two attempts on Trump’s life - the second last month at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Also in attendance were Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, as well as son Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump after the earlier shooting. Trump largely stuck to familiar talking points during his speech, railing against the “corrupt system”, promising to bring “respect” back to US foreign policy and vowing to shut the “open border”, which he claims is a source of crime. “You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, and defends your sovereignty, your security, your dignity and your freedom,” he told the thousands gathered at the showgrounds in Butler to large applause. He also struck out at his political opponents, accusing them of “slandering” him and attempting to interfere in the election, and “who knows - maybe even tried to kill me.” “But I’ve never stopped fighting for you,” he added. “Never will.” Trump repeatedly referenced the previous shooting, and the event included a moment of silence for Corey Competore, the volunteer firefighter who was killed in the July shooting. “He’s become somewhat of a folk hero,” Trump added. “Our beautiful Corey.”  The former president had fulsome praise for Elon Musk and went out of his way to invite him to the stage. The tech billionaire told the crowd he thought this was ""the most important election of our lifetime"" and exhorted voters to register and elect Trump. Between 25,000 and 30,000 people were expected at the rally, which snarled traffic to a standstill in the rural town north of Pittsburgh for the entirety of Saturday. Many waited for as many as 10 hours in harsh sun to be let in past a long string of vendors selling Trump-Vance campaign flags, hats, signs and orange wigs meant to emulate the former president. “I certainly admire his willingness to come back here and give the speech he was denied last time,” said Teresa Wilson, a former US Marine who also attended the previous rally on 13 July. “I’d understand if he avoided coming back - I know some spectators who didn’t want to return, and some who were very apprehensive,” she added. “If he can stand in the place of the previous attempt, then we as his constituency can certainly show up to offer our support.” With just 31 days to go until Americans vote, polls show Trump and Kamala Harris in a tight race in Pennsylvania -  a hotly contested battleground state that could prove pivotal. Data from the New York Times and Siena College, for example, shows the two nearly deadlocked in a tie, 49% to 48% in Harris’s favour. In dozens of interviews with Trump supporters at the rally, most identified the economy - particularly inflation - as their primary concern ahead of the election. “We’re not being taken care of. People can’t afford food. They can barely afford gas [petrol],” said Jessenia Anderson, a voter who was at the rally wearing a red ""Latinas for Trump"" T-shirt. “I have a family, but I find myself making cheaper [meals], buying cheaper things.” Others - such as rapper Sean Moon, a Tennessee voter - pointed to the US-Mexico border and concern over immigration as the main reason they supported the former president. Migrant crossings over the US southern border hit record levels under the Biden-Harris administration but the numbers have dropped significantly in recent months. “That’s an existential threat for this country,” said Mr Moon, the son of a North Korean refugee, about migrant crossings. The event in Butler, he said, was his 15th consecutive Trump rally. “There are people coming in without being vetted. They tell untruths and get rewarded for it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241011-six-books-to-help-understand-the-us-and-its-history,Six books to read to help understand the US,"From the pursuit of happiness to the economy – in the run-up to the election, here are some books that offer context, insight and perspectives on the US.",2 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"From the pursuit of happiness to the economy – in the run-up to the election, here are some books that offer context, insight and perspectives on the US. In the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election, it seems there is plenty for the population to disagree on. To help understand the differences of opinion, consider the following six books, which offer detailed analyses of the issues and their context. The books cover everything from the Declaration of Independence and shifts in conservative politics – beginning in the Reagan era – to the US's cultural foundations. Also in the mix: the opioid drug epidemic, initiated in 1996 by the marketing of the prescription pain medication Oxycontin, and the economy, amid concerns about the cost of living. Will the US be able to achieve a sense of ""We the people"" despite disagreements? That's the question to be answered by the 5 November election.  Harvard history professor and New Yorker contributor Jill Lepore draws the title of her comprehensive and gripping US history from the Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" Covering the 16th Century through to 2018, the book is ""the story of a nation, multiracial at its founding, and those who sought to find ways to realise 'these truths,'"" writes John S Gardner in The Guardian. ""No country before or since has been this convulsed with conflict and wealth,"" writes Andrew Sullivan in The New York Times Book Review. ""No country had ever been defined as one of strangers and travellers, where waves and waves of immigration constantly churned through society… No people were as passionate both for slavery and for freedom."" These Truths is the perfect civics book for these times. It is not a story of ""relentless progress"", notes The New York Times Best Books of 2018, ""but of conflict and contradiction, with crosscurrents of reason and faith, black and white, immigrant and native, industry and agriculture rippling through a narrative that is far from completion.""  The last of Pearlstein's four-volume chronicle of the rise of conservatism in the US is a colourful narrative history. Perlstein begins with the Gerald Ford/Jimmy Carter presidential campaign. Reagan, a primary candidate who didn't make the cut, refused to help Ford, setting the stage for his own successful run against Carter four years later. ""It's all here – the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, brother Billy, the Panama Canal Treaty, California's Proposition 13 cutting property taxes, supply side economics, the 'killer rabbit', direct mail, the Ford Pinto, Ted Kennedy, Three Mile Island, malaise and a hundred other incidents and stories that defined these tumultuous years,"" John S Gardner writes in The Guardian. Reaganland ""is essentially sociopolitical history, focusing on the movements and causes that animated public debate so virulently and the impacts of major social changes, such as women's rights, on American life"". Follow it with Max Boot's new biography, Reagan, which focuses on the links between Reagan and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. In Culture Wars (1991), Hunter coined the term that describes the divide between two opposing forces in the US. ""Democracy in America is in crisis,"" he writes in Democracy and Solidarity, his new book. He examines US political culture over two-and-a-half centuries, identifies the cultural roots of the crisis – the promise that all are created equal, versus the practice of excluding wide swaths of humanity. ""Hunter is the nation's leading cultural historian,"" writes David Brooks in The New York Times. ""He reminds us that a nation's political life rests upon cultural foundations. Each society has its own way of seeing the world, its own basic assumptions about what is right and wrong, its own vision of a better world that gives national life direction and purpose."" American culture, which often achieves solidarity through opposition to a common enemy or affirmation of a common goal, has ""unravelled at its deepest levels,"" Hunter writes. In June 2022, in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation, the US Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that granted women the constitutional right to abortion, based on the right to privacy implied in the 14th Amendment. This action set in motion an avalanche of state bills to ban abortion, and parallel protests and actions to restore Roe. In Garrow's landmark legal history, he begins with a 40-year struggle to repeal Connecticut's law banning birth control. He fastidiously covers Roe v Wade, its precursors and successors, including the 25 years of litigation post-Roe. It is a ""a monumental, sprawling, insightful, frustrating, challenging and wide-ranging book that chronicles one of the most profound transformations in the lives of modern Americans,"" writes sociologist and legal scholar Kristin Luker in The New York Times. She notes that ""much of the struggle over the boundaries of the sexual revolution took place in legislatures and in courtrooms"". The case, concludes Garrow, represents one of the two most important stories in 20th-Century legal history (the other is Brown vs Board of Education). What comes next is likely to be determined by the US presidential election. Quinones's National Book Critics Circle award-winning Dreamland pieces together the puzzle of ""the worst drug scourge to ever hit the country"". ""Children of the most privileged group in the wealthiest country in the history of the world were getting hooked and dying in almost epidemic numbers through substances meant to numb pain,"" he writes. Overdose deaths involving opiates rose from 10 a day in 1999 to one every 30 minutes by 2012. Quinones's chronicle of ""pain pills, pill mills, Mexican traffickers, the quiet surrounding the epidemic,"" is told in dramatic, heartbreaking detail, connecting small towns and suburbs across the US with a small town in Mexico in a ""catastrophic synergy"". OxyContin came first, he writes, ""introduced by reps from Purdue Pharma over steak and dessert and in air-conditioned doctors' offices. Within a few years, black tar heroin followed in tiny, uninflated balloons held in the mouths of sugarcane farm boys from Xalisco driving old Nissan Sentras to meet-ups in McDonald's parking lots"". Quinones offers glimmers of hope, including the widespread availability of naloxone, the heroin overdose antidote (also used now against fentanyl, the synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin). The ultimate antidote, he argues, is community. Economist Gilder's 1981 book Wealth and Poverty defined supply-side economics, and influenced the politics of the Reagan administration. His new one offers a contrarian theory based on the concept that knowledge is the true wealth. ""When you insert your credit card into the gas pump, what you're really buying is the knowledge that makes the transaction possible,"" Gilder writes. The essence of life after capitalism, he argues, is ""the enormous shift of power – enabled by government control of money… away from productive citizens, innovators, and entrepreneurs to politicians, bankers and bureaucrats"". Gilder's system is based on information theory. ""Economics focuses on human wants and incentives; information theory focuses on human creativity."" His key principles: ""Wealth is knowledge, growth is learning, information is surprise, money is time."" Gilder tends to side with optimists, confident that technology, entrepreneurship and innovation can drive economic progress. Economic concerns are key to the upcoming election, with the majority of Americans (some 70%, according to Pew research), worrying about the rising costs of food and housing. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkd4nzj0n6o,Lib Dems set sights on county council elections,The BBC's Michael Keohan says there is a sense among Lib Dem members that the party is back.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"At the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, BBC political reporter Michael Keohan has spoken to the party's representatives in Kent about their ambitions for the county. It might seem a touch premature for the Liberal Democrats to be popping champagne corks at their autumn conference in Brighton having secured just one of 18 Kent MPs in July’s general election.  However at conference, there is a real sense they are back, and on the up. The newly-elected Tunbridge Wells MP, Mike Martin, told me: “We’re not just a party of the protest vote, we’re a party of making a difference to the communities we serve.” Meanwhile, Kent county councillor Richard Streatfeild said: “There is real hope that at next May’s county council elections we could become one of, if not the largest, party. ""We got a bronze medal in the general elections, but come next May, we’re looking for gold."" But where has this hope come from?  The change in demographics around some of Kent’s costal towns post Covid, and the prominence of water quality have played well for the Lib Dems, not to mention securing the Tunbridge Wells seat at the last election, the first time in the constituency's history it has been anything other than Conservative. However, it is not all positive stories. Graham Colley has stood twice for the Lib Dems at elections this year. Firstly, as their Kent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) candidate in May and most recently as their Rochester and Strood candidate at the general election. He told me: “We still have work to do,"" adding, ""in July, I lost my deposit,"" having failed to secure enough of the vote in Medway. At the conference, the message has largely focussed on health and social care, with a side order of water quality, a greatest hits list from the election for the Lib Dems.  The gimmicks have also kept coming, with the leader of the party, Sir Ed Davey, arriving in Brighton on jet ski. One thing that has struck me from the fringe events is the belief many of the members and activists who knock on our doors, or canvas our support, now have that change is possible, and that they are now the party of holding Westminster to a centre ground. Looking ahead to where the party could follow Mike Martin’s success in Tunbridge Wells, the newly-elected MP told me “Sevenoaks and Margate” could be target areas.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04n1kg1d4o,Trump and Harris are deadlocked - could an October surprise change the game?,"With one month to go, any unexpected event could help sway this close race for the White House.",6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"With one month to election day, the contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the electoral equivalent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The race for the White House still appears deadlocked, both nationally and in battleground states, so victory will be decided by the slimmest of margins - every new voter engaged, every undecided voter swayed, could help land a knock-out punch. “In any super close race, where the electorate is divided down the middle, a difference of a percentage point or two could be decisive,” says David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. While party strategists are focused on how to earn that decisive edge, it could just as easily be an event out of their control, an unexpected twist, that upends the campaign in the final weeks. It’s already been a year of political shockwaves - from one candidate surviving two assassination attempts and being convicted of a crime, to another, President Joe Biden, dropping out of the race in favour of his much younger vice-president. However, when the surprises drop in October - think Trump’s Access Hollywood tape or Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016 - there is scarcely time left to recover or regain momentum after a misstep or bad news cycle. This week alone, there were several new rumbles that could turn into political storms by 5 November. The first potential political storm was a literal one. Hurricane Helene tore through two key electoral battlegrounds last week, Georgia and North Carolina. Because of the intense focus on both states during this presidential race, a humanitarian disaster, with a death toll already over 200, has also become a political issue. Harris pledged long-term aid to the region at a stop in Georgia earlier this week, and visited those affected by the storm in North Carolina on Saturday. ""We're here for the long haul,"" she said in Georgia. Meanwhile, both states are essentially must-wins for Trump, and polls show a dead heat. While visiting Georgia, the former president claimed that Americans were losing out on emergency relief money because it had been spent on migrants. In fact, the two distinct programmes have separate budgets, and the Biden administration accused Republicans of spreading ""bold-faced lies"" about funding for the disaster response. When disaster strikes, it's not easy for the government to keep everyone happy. If Trump’s attacks land, any voter dissatisfaction with recovery efforts could potentially impact the result in two of the most closely-watched states in the country. Thousands of miles from the disaster-ravaged American southeast, a manmade crisis continues to inject itself into American politics. The Gaza war is in danger of expanding into a regional conflagration, as Israeli forces fought Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon and Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel earlier this week. While Harris has presented herself as a candidate of change, she put no distance between herself and the current administration when it comes to US-Israeli policies. That comes with risks. Hopes for any kind of pre-election ceasefire in Gaza appear firmly dashed, and the White House at this point is trying to ensure that the inevitable Israeli response to Tuesday’s Iranian strike doesn’t lead to all-out war. On Thursday night, Biden was not exactly reassuring. “I don’t believe there’s going to be an all-out war,” he said. “I think we can avoid it. But there’s a lot to do yet.” The war is also having consequences at home for Democrats, even if American voters usually don’t think directly about foreign policy when they cast their ballots. Harris’s commitment to continue supplying arms to Israel is a problem for two key segments of the Democratic base: Arab-Americans in the must-win state of Michigan, and young voters on campuses, where anti-war protests could start up again. The conflict in the Middle East has also fuelled pocketbook concerns. Biden’s mention of the possibility that Israel would target Iranian refineries caused the price of oil to jump more than 5% on Thursday. If there’s one thing that American consumers are particularly sensitive to, it's higher prices at the petrol pump. Across the board, public opinion surveys continue to show that the economy is the top issue for American voters. And Harris and the Democrats received some good news on that front on Friday, with the latest employment figures showing robust job growth over the past few months and an unemployment level that dropped to 4.1%. According to Mr Greenberg, however, voter concerns on the economy are about more than the latest job figures. “When people complain about the economy, what they’re really complaining about is the longer-term failure in certain parts of the country - rural America’s de-industrialised communities,” he says. “Those are parts of the country that are hurting even in a good economy.” For most of the election season, Trump has fared better than Harris when voters are asked who they think would do a better job with the economy, including in a recent CNN poll. But there are signs his lead may not be set in stone, such as a Cook Political Report survey of swing states that showed the two candidates tied on who would be best at dealing with inflation. One looming economic pitfall for Democrats also evaporated this week - the dockworkers strike, which had briefly shut down critical ports on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for the first time in 50 years. Both parties agreed to return to the bargaining table in January, reopening the ports. If a work stoppage had continued, it could have disrupted supply chains and driven up consumer prices in the weeks before the election.  Meanwhile, undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border have returned to pre-Covid pandemic levels, after hitting a record high of 249,741 last December. While the impact of that border surge is still being felt in many American cities, the urgency of the crisis may be diminishing. While much of this week’s news could spell trouble for Harris and the Democrats, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for Trump. His conduct during the 6 January attack on the US Capitol once again came into focus on Wednesday, when a federal judge released a document from special counsel Jack Smith outlining his case and evidence against Donald Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election result. The document, which argued that the former president should not be given presidential immunity from prosecution, contained new details about Trump’s words and actions leading up to the Capitol riot by his supporters. A recent CNN poll shows that voters favour Harris over Trump on issues of “protecting democracy” by 47% to 40% - so anything that renews attention on the chaotic final weeks of Trump’s presidency could be to the Democrat’s advantage. The term “October surprise” has been a fixture in American political lexicon for nearly 50 years. Campaigns dread the unexpected headline or crisis that pushes their candidates off message and changes the trajectory of a race. Even the smallest ripple in public opinion might deliver the White House in a year when the electoral margins in the swing states could be measured in only tens of thousands of votes. November’s balloting, says Mr Greenberg, is shaping up to be a nail-biter. “I don’t have any fingernails left,” he says. “I could totally imagine this election going either way with extremely significant consequences riding on that vote no matter where your loyalty is.” North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy437gnp28zo,Northern Lights possible as solar storms gather,The largest solar flare since 2017 has been spotted erupting from the Sun’s surface.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A huge solar flare, the largest since 2017, has been spotted erupting from the Sun’s surface. Solar flares are made up of electromagnetic radiation that travel from the Sun at the speed of light and can reach Earth in about eight minutes. They can disrupt some radio communications and satellites but most of us are unlikely to see those effects. There is also a chance that northern latitudes could see the Northern Lights this weekend as two geomagnetic storms are predicted to hit Earth. Solar flares do not cause the Northern Lights. They are caused by a phenomenon called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that erupt from an active sun spot. Combined with flares, they can create solar storms that interact with Earth's magnetic field or magnetosphere. The CMEs spew out plasma and magnetic field, and up to billions of tons of material, that can hit Earth. As our magnetosphere repels the storm, it creates the aurora. “There is the potential for a coronal mass ejection to arrive at Earth late on Friday or early on Saturday, which could lead to visible aurora for Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England,” said Met Office Space Weather Manager Krista Hammond.  A second CME is likely to hit Earth on Saturday and Sunday, associated with the solar flare which is rated X9. That means “enhanced auroral visibility is possible further south across central England and similar latitudes, though cloud and rain could hamper viewing potential for some,” says Krista Hammond. In the US, aurora might be seen in the northern states, and from the mid-west to Oregon, according to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Centre. The X9 solar flare emitted is the largest categorised by Nasa. The smallest is B, followed by C, M, and X. The scale ranks from 1 to 9, so X9 is the most powerful in Nasa's ranking. The Sun is approaching something called “solar maximum” which is when it is most active in an 11-year cycle. As the Sun continues in this active phase, Earth is more likely to be hit by strong geomagnetic storms, meaning there is higher chance of seeing the Aurora Borealis for the next few months. But scientists only know if solar maximum has happened six months after the event,  because they use six months of data analysing the intensity and frequency of sun spots. Current predictions suggest we could reach solar maximum at the end of 2024 or early 2025.  BBC weather presenter Simon King says the UK weather does not look good for people hoping to spot the aurora this weekend. “It would just be the far north-east of Scotland getting the odd break in the cloud for a short time,"" he says. “If activity turns out to be a bit stronger, the best of the clear skies on Friday night will be more towards central and south England. He says clouds may hamper viewings on Saturday night despite the evening starting with a lot of clear skies."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr75z7kd300o,A12 upgrade plan: Strong views on traffic lights,The council says it plans to carry out £63.3m worth of improvements to help with congestion.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"There are ""too many traffic lights"" in the plans to upgrade a major road, according to some residents.  A scheme was put forward to upgrade the A12 which links the county's two biggest towns, Lowestoft and Ipswich. The plan would also see improvements to the A14 Seven Hills junction and seven out of the eight roundabouts through to A1152 Woods Lane, in Melton. The first public exhibition of the proposals was held in Woodbridge on Thursday where residents expressed their thoughts on the plans.  Steph and Jim Maltby live in Wickham Market and went to see the first exhibition at Woodridge Community Hall. Mrs Maltby said she ""hoped"" her drive from the Seven Hills junction to Wickham Market would see an improvement. However with ""the considerable amount of traffic lights that they're putting in"" she thought this might not happen. The couple had originally moved to Wickham Market as they came from an area where with ""too many traffic lights"" where ""it didn't work effectively"", according to Mrs Maltby. Mr Maltby said he was concerned that if the lights were not ""state of the art"" with the ""algorithms to maximise flow"", then their car journeys would be affected.  He said he had been reassured at the exhibition that the lights did use ""fancy algorithms"" and he hoped the developers were ""true to their word"". Phillip Ainsworth, chief executive of Suffolk Agricultural Association, based at Trinity Park in Ipswich, said he believed the scheme would help support businesses in the area with their operations.  ""Clearly there's got to be something done to recognise the increase in particularly larger traffic coming out of Felixstowe for Sizewell C and other major projects going on at the moment,"" he told the BBC. He added that the improvements could specifically help support events at Trinity Park like the annual Suffolk show. ""If there's a way to better regulate traffic flow and traffic lights might well help with that, and with more lanes available, it's got to help with getting in and out of the show in particular,"" he said. ""It's not that bad in terms of how long it takes you to get in and out at the moment but recognising there's going to be a lot more additional traffic with all the housing and business developments going on, you can see why strategically this is quite an important and necessary investment."" As well as the changes to the junctions along the A12, there would also be a new bus route, along Portal Avenue linking the A12 to the A1214 in North Martlesham, under the plans. New shared paths and crossings for pedestrians and cyclist would be added and an overbridge at Martlesham Heath would be expanded. A new dual carriageway was also being suggested at Seckford Hall, near Woodbridge, between the B1438 and B1079. Jim Hardwicke lives near this planned new road in Woodbridge and was ""not in favour of widening any roads and wants to see them reduced"". He does however support improved crossing for walking and cycling.  Mr Hardwicke said you had to ""take your life in your hands"" when attempting to cross the A12 at the B1097 roundabout in the area. The scheme is estimated to cost £63.6m with £5m coming from ""third parties"".  The government allocated £54m in funding for it last year. Chris Chambers, Suffolk County Council’s cabinet member for transport strategy, planning and waste, said the improvements would help ease congestion. ""These improvements will provide greater access to the east coast, an area with several Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) including Sizewell C, easing congestion and network disruption during its construction,"" he said. ""I encourage residents to look at the plans, read up on the benefits and let us know their thoughts."" Sandy Martin, a county councillor and deputy leader of the Labour Group, said he was not ""convinced"" the county council took ""air pollution seriously enough"". ""We need to promote sustainable transport policies which do not pollute the community around us,"" he said. ""The more roads you build the more traffic you get on the roads - we need to invest more in public transport - I don’t want to encourage congestions but building new roads to deal with congestion is not the answer."" A public consultation on the plans is open until 29 October.  Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99v3397pdpo,Five takeaways from new filing in Trump election case,"Trump allegedly said it didn't matter if he won or lost 2020 election, he would still ""fight like hell"".",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump's alleged criminal efforts to overturn his 2020 US election defeat are described in detail across 165 pages of a new filing from the federal prosecutor investigating him. The filing, released by a judge on Wednesday, lays out in depth how Special Counsel Jack Smith would pursue his case if it ever comes to trial, which is uncertain. Since Trump is expected to end the prosecution if he returns to the White House, Mr Smith may never be able to make an opening statement or call a witness. The Supreme Court ruled this summer that Trump cannot be prosecuted for official acts carried out as president, forcing Mr Smith to change the historic case and argue that Trump committed crimes as a private citizen.  Trump denies any wrongdoing in trying to block Joe Biden's certification as the election winner and his campaign called the document ""falsehood-ridden"". The judge overseeing the case has given Trump's team until 7 November - two days after the presidential election - to make a response to the latest filing. Here are five key points detailed in the prosecutor's arguments and evidence released on Wednesday. “It doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election,"" Trump allegedly said at some point after the election. ""You still have to fight like hell.” The filing cites these comments - reported by an unnamed assistant who overheard Trump speaking to his family - as evidence he was trying to overturn the result. And the document says Trump laid the groundwork for challenging the election even before polling day. It alleges the Republican had been told that the results would not be known on the day that most Americans voted - but that he might have an early edge before rival Democrats benefited from mail-in voting, which took longer to count. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, many voters had voted by mail. Trump allegedly told advisers that he would ""simply declare victory before all the ballots were counted and any winner was projected"".  The former president's allies were clear on what that meant, according to the filing. ""He's going to declare victory. That doesn't mean he's the winner, he's just going to say he's the winner,"" a Trump adviser is quoted telling a private gathering of his supporters. The filing shows how Trump allegedly carried out his plan to claim victory in several battleground states before votes were fully tallied by spreading false claims of fraud. Yet he is said to have characterised fraud claims made by some of his allies as unbelievable. The filing quotes him telling aides that one unnamed lawyer - who appears to be Sidney Powell - was making ""crazy"" claims, which he likened to sci-fi series Star Trek. ""Nonetheless, the defendant continued to support and publicise"" such claims, the document says.  On another occasion, a White House official reportedly told Trump that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, would not be able to prove his election fraud theories in court.  ""The details don't matter,""  he reportedly replied. The world has seen the deep rift between Pence and Trump that developed after the election. The filing includes new details on supposedly how their relationship deteriorated. Mr Smith argues that since they interacted as election running mates, Trump's communication with his vice-president did not count as an official act.  Pence, according to the filing, ""gradually and gently"" tried to convince Trump to accept the election results, ""even if it meant they lost"". As Trump continued spreading false fraud claims and filing legal challenges, Pence reportedly suggested on 12 November a “face-saving option”: ""Don’t concede but recognise the process is over."" Days later, he encouraged Trump to accept the loss and run again in four years, to which Trump supposedly responded: ""I don’t know, 2024 is so far off."" Eventually, on 1 January 2021, Trump allegedly told Pence that ''hundreds of thousands"" of people ""are gonna think you're stupid"" for wanting to acknowledge their loss. Less than a week later, Trump supporters called for Pence to be hanged as they stormed the US Capitol building in the 6 January riot, because he planned to sign off on Biden's election win. Pence fled to safety in a parking garage. The filing says that when Trump was informed Pence might be in danger, he allegedly asked: ""So what?"" Mr Smith's team alleges Trump's campaign sowed ""chaos"" in battleground states that risked triggering violence.  When a large batch of ballots in the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, Michigan, seemed to put Biden ahead, a Trump campaign operative allegedly told his colleague to ""find a reason"" that something was wrong with them. The colleague then suggested that could cause unrest. According to the filing, the operative answered: ""Make them riot."" Campaign officials in another swing state, Pennsylvania, allegedly provoked confrontations, which were then used to claim that observers were not given proper legal access to the vote counting. The prosecutors allege that Trump incited the 6 January Capitol riot by telling a crowd ""many of the same lies he had been telling for months"". In a speech in Washington that morning, Trump ""made clear that he expected his supporters to take action"", according to the filing. Mr Smith has made this allegation before, but he now contends that Trump fired up supporters as a political candidate, not president, and the speech was part of a rally. His team argues that Trump ""directed his supporters to go to the Capitol and suggested he would go with them"" to provoke further action. Then, Trump and his allies allegedly sought to ""exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol"" to try to delay the election certification. Trump watched the riot unfold on Twitter and Fox News, says the filing, citing information from his phone and former White House staff. He also allegedly used social media to target Pence and repeatedly ""refused""  advisers' requests to ""issue a calming message and make efforts to stop the riot"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5l9jzjglo,Ryan Routh charged with attempted assassination of Trump,"Routh, 58, is being held in jail awaiting trial on two federal gun crime charges.",25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US prosecutors have charged a man arrested near Donald Trump's Florida golf course with the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate. It comes a day after a court filing showed Ryan Wesley Routh had written a note months ago saying he intended to kill Trump. Routh, 58, already faces up to 20 years behind bars on two gun-related charges. But he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on the new, more serious charge. “Violence targeting public officials endangers everything our country stands for,"" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, vowing to ""use every available tool"" to hold Routh accountable. Trump has accused the government of mishandling the case, writing in a social media post on Monday that the justice department should “LET FLORIDA HANDLE THE CASE!” But Garland rebuffed that, telling reporters on Tuesday that his agency will “seek to cooperate and get assistance from” state officials “consistent with the law”. Court documents show the case has been assigned through random selection to US District Judge Aileen Cannon. Ms Cannon is the South Florida judge who was assigned last year to Trump's federal classified documents case and who threw it out earlier this year. Her decision is currently under appeal. A separate judge on Monday ordered Routh to remain in custody after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk and a danger to the community. The suspect is being held at a detention centre in South Florida since his arrest on 15 September. Earlier that day, a Secret Service agent had spotted his rifle poking through a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.  The agent opened fire as the three-time Republican presidential nominee was playing a round of golf. Routh fled without firing a shot, leaving his weapon and other items at the scene as agents escorted Trump to safety. He was arrested shortly afterwards, after a witness spotted him on the highway. On Monday, new court records unveiled evidence to suggest Routh had been plotting his attack on Trump for months. In a pre-written letter addressed to ""The World"" and sent to an unnamed witness months earlier, Routh appears to pre-empt a failed assassination attempt on the former president. ""I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,"" the letter reads, with the offer of a cash reward to anyone ""who can complete the job"". In addition to the attempted assassination charge, an eight-page indictment unsealed on Tuesday also charges Routh with: According to the indictment, Routh ""did forcibly assault, oppose, impede, intimidate, and interfere"" with a Secret Service special agent. He returns to court for an arraignment hearing on Monday 30 September, where he is expected to enter a plea. Separately on Tuesday, his son, Oran Routh, was arrested on federal charges of receipt and possession of child pornography. Authorities discovered ""hundreds"" of pornographic files while searching the younger Routh's residence in North Carolina over the weekend in connection with the investigation into his father. Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life after Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire on the former president during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July.  Crooks was shot dead by counter-snipers. "

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9lg50gndo,"Biden was right to stand aside in critical election, Clinton says","The former presidential hopeful tells the BBC ""the future of democracy is at stake"" in November's vote.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Hillary Clinton has told the BBC that Joe Biden was right to stand aside in the US presidential election after his stumbling debate performance against Donald Trump earlier this year. ""Once that debate happened, he could not recover and he did the right thing,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. She also said Democrats had not been effective in telling Trump supporters what they were doing to address their economic concerns.  In 2016, the former US secretary of state was unexpectedly defeated by Trump, who now faces Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November's election, which polls suggest is extremely tight. She said she saw Joe Biden a week before the debate and saw no reason then why he should step down but that all changed. Clinton also said the future of democracy is at stake in this election and called on Harris to ""defeat Donald Trump to break the fever that he has caused in our political system"". ""The two candidates have presented extremely different agendas for where they want to take our country,"" Clinton said in the BBC interview, which came as she promotes her new memoir. Trump has rejected the notion that he is a threat and said the real threat comes from the Democratic Party.   The election, Clinton said, would have repercussions far beyond the US including ""whether or not we continue supporting Ukraine, whether we can get some kind of workable resolution in the Middle East and so much else"". Trump has previously indicated that he would cut US aid for Ukraine. After meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Friday, the former US president said he had ""a very good relationship"" with both Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.  “We both want to see a fair deal made,"" Trump said. The war, he added, ""should stop and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop, and I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that’s a good combination.” Clinton, who served as secretary of state in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, also criticised Trump's promise to begin a mass deportation of illegal immigrants if elected. ""Let's start with one million,” his vice-presidential pick JD Vance said of the plan in August. “That's where Kamala Harris has failed. And then we can go from there.” ""He is going to have a military presence [in US cities] to achieve his goals,"" Clinton said on Monday. ""If you look a certain way, if you talk a certain way, you will be subject to these Draconian measures."" When asked what drives Trump's support, she told the BBC that ""people support him for different reasons"" including feeling ""overlooked"" and ""unseen"" or that the ""economy doesn't work for them"". ""I think our problem is frankly we are not the most effective messengers,"" she said of the Democratic Party. ""About what we see and what we’re trying to do to address these real and legitimate concerns that people have. I recognise and accept my share of the responsibility."" The expectation upon politicians to be entertaining or outrageous in a social media age makes it harder to ""do the hard, boring work of actually getting things done,"" she added. Polling suggests Trump is more trusted on the election's biggest issue, the economy. The election will be held on 5 November and the new president will take office in January. Polls are currently very tight in the seven states considered as crucial in the contest, with just one or two percentage points separating the two candidates. Clinton, 76, was the first woman nominee for president from a major political party when she ran against Trump in 2016. Her husband, Bill Clinton, whom she married in 1975, was president from 1993 until 2001."

The Citizen, Mwananchi and Mwanaspoti newspapers have had their online licences suspended for 30 days over the viral animated clip, which has since been removed. The clip, just over a minute long, published by the Citizen on social media highlighted the increasing cases of abductions and disappearances in the country. The media regulator said the content ""threatens and is likely to affect and harm national unity and social peace of the United Republic of Tanzania"".  Rights groups have accused President Samia's government of stifling dissent and targeting opponents ahead of next year's general elections.  It follows a recent wave of abductions, arrests and the brutal killing of an opposition official in the country.  Wednesday's ban affects all websites, social media and YouTube platforms of the three newspapers, all run by Mwananchi Communication Limited (MCL).  The viral animation by the Citizen, which authorities said violated the country's online communication laws, was published on Tuesday.  It depicted a female cartoon character who resembled Samia with her signature hijab.   It showed the character switching between different TV stations. On each one there was someone complaining about the killing, abduction or disappearance of a family member. At the end, the character appears upset by all the complaints.  Mpoki Thomson, the Citizen's managing editor, said the animation depicted ""events that raised concerns regarding the safety and security of individuals in Tanzania"". The animation was taken down a few hours later due to what the newspaper termed ""misinterpretation"" by the public. ""Our decision to take down the animation stems from the misinterpretation it has generated, which diverges from our original intent,” Mr Thomson said in a statement.  In a statement on Wednesday, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) said the audio-visual content violated the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations of 2020]. ""Following the publication of content which contravenes the law, TCRA suspends online media services licences for The Citizen, Mwananchi Digital, Mwananchi and Mwanaspoti for a period of 30 days,"" it added.  The suspension prevents the outlets from publishing any content online, ""while further regulatory actions are under review.""  The media company has assured its audience that it would continue to serve them through its daily print editions and noted that it would engage with the authorities to resolve the matter.  Rights groups and opposition parties have condemned the ban, describing it as a move to muzzle the media in the country.  It comes two years after the lifting of a ban on four newspapers that had been barred from publishing since 2016 and 2017 for exposing alleged corruption and human rights violations.  The four newspapers, Daima, Mawio, Mwanahalisi and Mseto, were banned from publishing for various offences under the restrictive Media Services Act, which came into force in 2016, under the late President John Magufuli.  When Samia succeeded Magufuli after his death in 2021, there were hopes that she would allow the media more freedom. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20md2rrjpvo,Top staff quit scandal-hit Robinson campaign,The Trump-endorsed candidate has vowed to stay in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Senior staff working for Republican Mark Robinson's campaign for North Carolina governor have quit after a report revealed his alleged past postings on a porn website's message board. Robinson's campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, finance director and senior adviser all stepped down over the weekend, the campaign confirmed in a statement to US media.  The furniture maker-turned-politician, who is running to be the state’s first black governor, allegedly called himself a “black Nazi” on a porn website more than a decade ago, according to a report by CNN. Robinson, who identifies as an evangelical Christian, branded the report ""tabloid lies"". The BBC has not independently verified CNN’s claims. ""Let me reassure you, the things you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,"" he said in a video statement posted to X. He has subsequently avoided talking about the story. The departure of top campaign staff came within days of the CNN exposé of Robinson's online postings in which he is also reported to have said he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama.  The report suggests that the alleged comments have now been removed from the adult website on which they appeared. “I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign,"" Robinson said in a statement. Among those who left Robinson's team over the weekend were key adviser Conrad Pogorzelski, who helped Robinson win election as North Carolina’s lieutenant governor in 2020. Pogorzelski also told US news outlets in a personal capacity that the group had left of their ""own accord"". The BBC has contacted Robinson campaign for comment. Robinson is running for office in a critical swing state being targeted by both Republicans and Democrats ahead of November's elections. The candidate himself has resisted pressure to quit the race from state Republicans - and reportedly also from Donald Trump's team. He was elected to be North Carolina's first black lieutenant governor in 2020. Trump himself has not publicly acknowledged the controversy. He previously endorsed Robinson for office, calling him ""Martin Luther King on steroids"". Some voters who the BBC spoke to in North Carolina afterwards were nonplussed by the story, with one woman even saying she was planning to donate more money to the Robinson campaign. The furore is being closely watched in the context of November's presidential election.  The Tar Heel State is described as ""purple"", as it could go either Democratic or Republican when picking the next US leader. That said, polls in the governor contest have indicated a lead for Robinson's rival, Democratic candidate Josh Stein, who is also the state attorney-general. As the deadline for withdrawing from the governor contest passed on Thursday evening, Robinson remained the Republican candidate. Even before the CNN exposé was published, Robinson was under scrutiny. He has faced backlash over 2019 comments in a Facebook video about abortion on demand, when he said women should be ""responsible enough to keep your skirt down"". In 2021, he refused to apologise after triggering a backlash by saying that children should not be learning about ""transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth""."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm241ng4qg7o,DUP leader pledges new approach in conference speech,Gavin Robinson says it is a time to reflect as he makes his first conference speech as DUP leader.,21 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The DUP leader Gavin Robinson has said it is “time to reflect” as he pledged a “new approach” to how the party does business. He made the remarks at his first conference as leader, and the first since Sir Jeffrey Donaldson resigned as leader in March. Sir Jeffrey quit after he was charged with historical sex offences - charges he denies. Robinson, who replaced him, said he promised to “chart a path for a stronger tomorrow”. Speaking to delegates in Belfast on Saturday, he said: “The last six months have been difficult and challenging. ""We don’t choose the challenges we face but we do choose how we approach them.” Robinson was ratified as DUP leader in May, when the party was preparing to fight the general election. He acknowledged the party’s loss of three seats in that election, and said the DUP would “work to re-engage with communities across Northern Ireland”. He added: “I am determined that in the remaining months of 2024 you will see that with a new leader there will be a new approach, both internally and externally, as to how we do our business which will be people-centred and focused on getting outcomes that better the lives of all our people. “With your support, I will continue to build and renew our party, our structures and our purpose.” Sir Jeffrey resigned as leader on 29 March this year - Good Friday - just as Easter holidays were beginning in Northern Ireland. He has since pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces, with a trial date fixed for next year. In his speech, Robinson said: ""If the message of Easter reminds us of anything, it’s that the darkness of Good Friday has passed; we won’t live in the shadows of yesterday but walk in the light of today and for the hope of tomorrow."" Robinson added that while the next assembly election is two and a half years away, the party ""must use the season wisely"". ""What we plant now, we must be ready to harvest, not for the DUP, but for Northern Ireland. The work has already started and will continue in the weeks ahead,” he added. ""The opportunity is great, but hope alone won’t secure it. Action is hope. There is no hope without action... and if we don't grasp this moment who will?"" The Belfast East MP also criticised those within unionism who have ""thrived on attacking one another"". “Let me say very clearly, I am not interested. Our electorate is not interested . ""For our part I am not prepared to be part of a cycle of pro-union in-fighting between people who should be working together and who say they share the same goal.""  He said the cost of division had been proven in recent council and assembly elections, but said there is still “the opportunity to reverse it”. Robinson also said that work on improving post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland continues. He said the DUP would vote against the current arrangements in a vote scheduled in the assembly before the end of this year, and he urged all unionist parties to “join with us and do likewise”. If autumn is a time for reflection and renewal, then sign the new DUP leader up. The scandal that engulfed the party around Jeffrey Donaldson has mostly settled down, election wounds have been licked and Gavin Robinson now seems determined to shift out of recovery mode and into his own reset. DUP members rallied round him when he unexpectedly became leader six months ago and it is clear they are rallying even harder now. Detail on Robinson’s idea to change how the party carries out internal business was light, but expect that to be a hot topic any time he appears on the airwaves. As for division between pro-union parties in future elections, Robinson repeated that he wants that to stop. And interestingly the Orange Order had a stall at the conference this year with orange coloured pens, saying: “Unionist people want unionist co-operation”. But the leader of unionism in Northern Ireland knows just like the job he has to rebuild and reset his party, that is very much easier said than done."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g52kwwz9no,Kidnap fears follow deadly South Sudan bus attack,"The Uganda-bound vehicle was targeted by rebels leaving one dead and several missing, the army says.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A long-distance bus has come under attack by gunmen in South Sudan on a main road south of the capital, Juba, leaving at least one person dead and several others feared kidnapped, the army has said. The passenger vehicle, heading for the Ugandan capital, Kampala, was targeted on Tuesday morning. Images from the scene show flames engulfing the inside of the bus and black smoke rising up into the sky. Despite a peace deal being in place to end years of civil war in South Sudan, insecurity remains rife in many parts of the country. Army spokesperson Maj Gen Lul Ruai Koang told the BBC that one person, a Ugandan man, had been killed and eight wounded. He added that seven others were missing and it is thought they may have been abducted. Gen Koang accused a rebel group, the National Salvation Front (NAS), of being behind the attack 80km (50 miles) from the capital. The group, led by former deputy chief of staff  Gen Thomas Cirilo Swaka, operates in areas south of Juba, as well as other parts of Central Equatoria state. NAS, which refused to sign the 2018 peace accord, has not commented on the bus attack. Earlier, the army spokesperson told Radio Tamazuj that the soldiers who were sent to the scene had fought off the attackers. There have been other violent incidents on the road linking Juba with the southern border town of Nimule. In August 2022, 11 passengers - South Sudanese and Ugandans - were killed and several others wounded when their vehicle was ambushed by unidentified armed men. And a year earlier, two South Sudanese Catholic nuns were killed along the same highway as they were travelling back to Juba. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204ywxzl11o,'It's just a mess' - Left in limbo by US student loan logjam,"As Democrats and Republicans fight over student debt, borrowers are caught in the middle.",29 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"After nearly two decades of student loan payments, Angela Carpio, 40, thought the finishing line was in sight. But now she's caught in the middle of a political tug of war over a $1.74tn (£1.31tn) mountain of student debt held by 45 million Americans, most of it owed to the federal government. For borrowers like Angela, a mother-of-two and software developer who lives near Minneapolis, Minnesota, the logjam has upended family budgets and made it difficult to plan. November's election, in which two candidates with starkly different visions for handling the debt are running neck-and-neck, is only adding to the sense of insecurity. Angela took out her first student loans in 2001, eventually borrowing about $25,000 as she attended the for-profit DeVry University in Florida before earning an associate degree at Valencia College. Despite making steady payments, her balance is still stuck at more than $20,000 as interest racks up. ""I'm just in limbo,"" she says. ""I don't know what's going to happen and it scares me.” Since the 1990s, the US has offered some borrowers the option to repay student loans using a process similar to the UK, where bills are based on a proportion of a borrower's income and the debt is written off after 25 years. But participation in the US repayment plan remained low, partly because of limited awareness. President Joe Biden, initially a sceptic of loan forgiveness, made it a signature policy for his administration, aiming to shore up support among younger voters, who are most likely to hold debts and rate the issue as important. Vice-President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to continue his efforts. Under Biden, the government has wiped out more than $168bn in debt for over 4.7 million borrowers, over a million of them lower-income Americans. That's more loan forgiveness than any other president. But the US Supreme Court last year struck down the White House's most sweeping proposal - to cancel $400bn in student loans for 16 million borrowers - ruling it was an illegal use of executive power. A second Biden plan called Save (Saving on a Valuable Education) - which offered lower monthly loan payments - is on hold pending federal court review. Republican officials have led the legal challenges, arguing the debt write-off is unfair to the vast majority of Americans who did not take out student loans. But supporters of the White House policy say they are merely trying to fix problems that they argue have unfairly deprived borrowers of relief. In the meantime, the court setbacks have caused head-spinning bureaucratic headaches for precisely those Biden was trying to help. Angela had enrolled in Biden’s Save payment plan, which promised to cut the $400 or so she owed each month roughly in half and cancel her debt after 20 years. While the legal challenge has halted her payments - for now - she said the temporary reprieve has only stoked her worries about what comes next. ""It's just a mess,"" she said. ""It's very confusing and very hard to plan when the most concrete things are no longer there."" The US put student loan payments on hold during the pandemic. As of January, a few months after payments resumed, only half of debtors were up to date on their bills. Veronica Williams, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, has $127,000 in student debt after earning a college and a master's degree. But the court battles have also left her loan up in the air, and she says she cannot even get answers about what she owes for her monthly payment. Veronica, who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs, backed Biden in 2020, but said she was still waiting to decide if she would support Democrats again. ""There's no clear understanding on what we're supposed to do,"" she said of her loan situation. ""It's disheartening because it feels like it leaves me and my friends and colleagues confused on what the future... is going to be for us."" On the campaign trail, Harris, while promising support for forgiveness, has not spotlighted the issue. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has argued that Democrats have ""taunted"" borrowers with hope while failing to deliver. At the same time, the Republican presidential nominee has condemned student debt forgiveness as ""vile"". For Republicans, who have seen college-educated and younger voters shift decisively to Democrats in recent years, the risks of opposing cancellation are minimal, said Anthony Fowler, a professor at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy. For Democrats, it remains to be seen whether student loan forgiveness will help or hurt. A June UChicago Harris/AP-NORC poll found just 30% of Americans approved of Biden's handling of the issue, though Republicans and the Supreme Court fared even worse. Prof Fowler said he thought embracing debt forgiveness could backfire for Democrats, noting that less than 40% of US adults over age 25 hold college degrees and research has found sweeping forgiveness would benefit households with higher-than-average incomes. ""The politics of asking your plumber to pay for your kids' fancy liberal arts degree - this doesn't make a lot of sense,"" he said. But Mallory SoRelle, professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, noted that an estimated one-third of Americans with student debt did not graduate and that polls indicate significant support among Democrats and independents for at least some relief. ""If [Biden's plans] actually had gone through in a timely manner, I think we would see a much bigger boost for Democrats, but this is an issue that voters still say they care about,"" she said. Robert Henley, a 68-year-old public sector retiree from Tallahassee, Florida, voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. He said he opposed debt forgiveness as too costly to the government and unfair to taxpayers like him and his wife who had sacrificed to save for their children's education. But he said he expected to vote for Harris in November anyway, citing other concerns - such as his mistrust of Trump. ""As a country, we cannot afford to be giving away money - but really more importantly from my point of view, it's unfair,"" he said. ""Obviously as a voter you can't have every single issue fall out the way you want it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4dw7q71g7o,Man charged in Trump assassination plot pleads not guilty,Prosecutors say Ryan Routh was spotted with a rifle as he hid in the bushes near Trump’s golf course in Florida.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course has pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal court. Prosecutors say Ryan Routh, 58, was spotted with a rifle as he hid in the bushes near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach earlier this month. A Secret Service officer protecting the former president allegedly spotted his rifle barrel poking through a fence and opened fire. Routh fled and was later arrested on Interstate 95, a main highway through the state. In addition to the attempted assassination of Trump, Routh has been charged with firearms offences and assaulting an officer. On Monday, Routh appeared in court handcuffed and wearing a brownish prison jumpsuit, according to CBS News, the BBC’s US partner. After each count was read to him, he shook his head in acknowledgment of the charges.  His attorneys entered a plea of not guilty and requested a trial by jury. The hearing lasted around five minutes. If convicted, Routh faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.  An earlier court filing showed that Routh had written a note months ago saying he intended to kill Trump. In a pre-written letter addressed to ""The World"" and sent to an unnamed witness months earlier, Routh appears to pre-empt a failed assassination attempt on the former president. ""I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,"" the letter reads, with the offer of a cash reward to anyone ""who can complete the job"". Routh has been held in prison in Florida since his arrest on 15 September. He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result. He was active in recruiting volunteers to fight in Ukraine’s war against Russia, and had a range of eclectic political views, although he was registered as a Democrat and made anti-Trump posts online. Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life after Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire on the former president during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July. Crooks was shot dead by counter-snipers. The Secret Service, the government agency tasked with protecting the president and other politicians and their family members, came under heavy criticism for allowing a gunman to get so close to the former president. Trump and his allies have complained about his Secret Service detail. On Monday the former president said that his protection had been scaled back, forcing him to hold an event in Wisconsin over the weekend inside, instead of outdoors in a venue with a larger capacity. The Secret Service said it was shortstaffed due to the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The agency is responsible for protecting foreign leaders during US visits, and more than 140 were expected at last week's UN meeting."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4qgxglnk1o,Kenyan MPs vote to impeach deputy president,"Rigathi Gachagua, 59, denies accusations of corruption and practising ethnically divisive politics.",6 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kenyan MPs have voted overwhelming in favour of removing the country's deputy president over accusations of corruption. Lawmakers also accuse Rigathi Gachagua of practising ethnically divisive politics and undermining the government. Gachagua denies any wrongdoing in a row that follows his recent fallout with President William Ruto. On Tuesday evening, Speaker Moses Wetangula announced that 281 MPs had adopted an 11-charge impeachment motion with 44 MPs voting against and one abstaining. It means Gachagua has become the first Kenyan deputy president to be impeached by the National Assembly - the country's Senate will decide if he gets ousted.  He is accused of acquiring properties through corrupt means. The vice-president, who is a wealthy businessman, said most of the houses and land belonged to his late brother's estate. However, many Kenyan MPs took to the parliamentary floor on Tuesday to tarnish his reputation - and to show they were on President Ruto's side in this row at the top of government. The political drama has taken the focus off demands of the largely disgruntled Kenyan public - as they struggle to cope with the high cost of living.  The 59-year-old politician, popularly known as “Riggy G”, has described allegations against him as ""outrageous"" and ""sheer propaganda"". Political tensions have been running high in the East African country since June when deadly demonstrations erupted over unpopular tax hikes, exposing a deep rift between Ruto and Gachagua. Ruto sacked most of his cabinet and brought in members of the main opposition following the anti-tax protests, in which more than 50 people were killed.  Several MPs allied to Gachagua were summoned by police last month, accused of funding the protests - though no charges were brought. Ahead of the vote, security was heightened in the capital, Nairobi, with police patrols and major roads leading to parliament blocked to the public. About 20 lawyers were hired to defend Gachagua against the impeachment motion, local media reported.  A total of 291 MPs, more than the 117 required by the constitution, signed the motion to initiate the impeachment process last week.  Gachagua failed in numerous court bids to stop the proceedings going ahead.  In a televised speech on Monday, he condemned Mwengi Mutuse, the MP who drafted the motion, calling the move “shameful and sensational”.  The motion lists 11 grounds for impeachment, including accusations that Gachagua amassed assets worth 5.2bn Kenyan shillings ($40m, £31m) in two years in unexplained wealth.  ""I am innocent of all these charges,"" Gachagua said.  ""I have no intention whatsoever to resign from this job. I will fight to the end."" He defended the controversial renovation for his official residence in the capital.  When big decisions are to be taken by MPs, the constitution stipulates that the public must be consulted first. According to a parliamentary report, more than 200,000 responses were received as part of that process - of which 65% supported Gachagua's impeachment, while nearly 34% opposed it. On Sunday, Gachagua appealed to Ruto and MPs to forgive him for any wrongdoing during his tenure. He later clarified that his apology was not an admission of guilt. Ruto is yet to comment about the impeachment motion publicly, but he is on record in the early days of his presidency as saying that he would never publicly humiliate his deputy.  Gachagua, a wealthy businessman from the vote-rich Mount Kenya region, battled previous corruption scandals to become Ruto's running mate in a closely fought election in August 2022. He is from the Kikuyu community, the country’s largest ethnic group, while President Ruto is a Kalenjin, an ethnic group which mainly lives in the Rift Valley. These two communities were at loggerheads after elections in 2007 - ethnic violence in which 1,200 people died nationwide. In 1989, then Vice-President Josephat Karanja resigned from office when he faced a similar motion. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The polls were due to take place this December.   A 2018 peace deal that ended a civil war allowed president Salva Kiir to remain in charge of a transitional government with his former foe Riek Machar serving as his deputy. South Sudan, the world's youngest country, has not held national elections since independence in 2011. The decision to postpone the vote by another two years has not come as a great surprise.   The political leaders of South Sudan have not exactly been racing to get ready for a vote.   This has fuelled suspicion that they are clinging onto power in the oil-rich country.   President Salva Kiir's office says essential tasks like writing a new constitution have to happen before an election.   Officials have also cited logistical and security challenges, which could not be overcome by the end of the year. Those in charge are the same leaders who plunged the country into a five-year civil war.   Given the current relative peace and the fact that neighbouring Sudan is being destroyed by conflict, South Sudan's politicians may not come under much international pressure.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglrrz95zzo,US imposes new sanctions on Russian state media,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the outlet RT of engaging in ""global covert activities"".",14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has announced new sanctions against the Russian media channel RT, accusing it of being a ""de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus"". The top US diplomat told reporters on Friday that RT is part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets which have sought to covertly ""undermine democracy in the United States"". He added that the Russian government has ""embedded within RT, a unit with cyber operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence"". RT live-streamed Mr Blinken's remarks on X and declared it the ""US's latest conspiracy theory"". Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said there should be a ""new profession"" in the US, of specialist in sanctions imposed on Russia. Responding to US allegations that RT had sought to influence elections, RT’s editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan who was sanctioned by the US last week said they were excellent teachers, adding that many RT staff had studied in the US, and with US funding. The State Department accused the state broadcaster, formerly Russia Today, of engaging in ""information operations, covert influence, and military procurement"" in countries in Europe, Africa, and North and South America. Mr Blinken also accused RT of running online fundraisers to purchase body armour, sniper rifles, drones and other equipment for Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. The network, he said, has also sought to influence Moldova's politics in coordination with Russian intelligence ahead of presidential elections in October 2024. The US had already indicted two RT employees for allegedly attempting to interfere in this year's presidential election, but US officials said on Friday the state broadcaster played a bigger role in Russia's efforts to undermine democracies.  The state-funded media organisation responded at the time by mocking the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"". ""Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections."" Mr Blinken said in a press conference: ""Our most powerful antidote to Russia's lies is the truth. It's shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness."" Mr Blinken emphasised that the sanctions were not related to the content of the outlet's reporting, and he affirmed the US's support for independent journalism. ""Covert influence activities are not journalism,"" he said. The announcement is part of a suite of actions the US government has taken against Russian state media as the 2024 election approaches. The State Department has also designated RT as a foreign mission."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20dr33xjeo,Sadness and defiance in Trump-shooting town trying to heal,The town is undergoing its own healing process ahead of the former president's visit.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Butler County in Western Pennsylvania is rock-solid Trump country. In front yards, on the sides of roads and at filling stations, the messages on the billboards are blunt. ""Bulletproof"" is one, on a picture of the former president with his fist raised, moments after he was shot in this very town. Another, more overtly political, reads: ""Even my dog hates Biden."" The former president got twice as many votes as Joe Biden here in 2020, beating Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a similar margin. In fact, this county has only voted Democrat once in the past 150 years of presidential elections. Butler has always been proud to be known as the home of the American Jeep but this year it is better remembered for one thing - where a former Republican president was inches away from being assassinated. A bullet grazed his ear that day, on 13 July, and Butler is undergoing its own healing process as Donald Trump returns to the same spot, the Farm Show grounds, for a rally on Saturday evening. Trump's speech is expected to begin at about 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT), with the site reportedly already in lockdown ahead of his visit. For the first time since publicly endorsing the former president, Elon Musk - the boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX - has confirmed he will be in the audience.  Ahead of Trump's return to Butler, the BBC has spoken to some of the people who were just a few feet away from him as the gunfire rang out back in July.  There is sadness and guilt among local Republicans and resentment, too, that their county - so staunchly pro-Trump - was where this happened. ""That was the saddest moment of my life,"" said Jim Hulings, chairman of the Butler County Republican Party, who was 30ft away at the time and thought Trump had been killed. “I was horrified to think that somebody had the audacity to shoot a great man.” Jondavid Longo, the mayor of Slippery Rock, a small town just a few miles away, was on stage moments before the shooting, part of the warm-up act. When the gunman began to fire, he instinctively used his body to cover his pregnant wife. He says he replays the incident in his mind every day. ""It's a difficult thing for us to come to terms with,"" he said. There is guilt that somebody else did lose their life that day, he says, and two others were seriously injured. That person was Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former volunteer fire fighter, who died after throwing himself in front of the bullets to protect his wife and daughters. His widow Helen seems lost and distracted when I meet her. It’s clear she’s struggling. ""I think about it every day. I see it every time I close my eyes."" She and Corey were childhood sweethearts, married for 29 years. And both staunch supporters of Trump. They joked that day that the former president was going to invite Corey up on stage, she said. Days later, his fire chief’s jacket was taken to the Republican convention in Milwaukee and placed on stage as Trump made his acceptance speech for the nomination. ""I just cried because, you know, I said he got his moment on stage with Trump."" Like Helen, Trump supporters in Butler have dozens of questions about how it could have happened. While the motive of the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, remain obscure, what has become much clearer is the series of security blunders that led to him pulling the trigger. Two hours before he opened fire, he was able to fly a drone around the site without being detected because Secret Service counter-surveillance equipment was not working. Communications failures meant that suspicious sightings of Crooks an hour and a half before he shot at Trump were not passed on to all elements of the Secret Service. More than half an hour before the shooting, he was seen by police using a rangefinder pointed at the stage - a device often used by hunters pursuing their prey.  Yet a little over 25 minutes later, Crooks had managed to climb on to the roof of a local business and fire eight shots. Seconds later he was dead, a single shot to the head from a Secret Service sniper. Those few seconds are still haunting many of those who witnessed it. Lucie Roth can be seen in the VIP seats behind Trump in one of the most recognisable pictures of the shooting, taken by a Reuters photographer. She initially thought the gunfire was fireworks but then she heard screams to ""Get down!"" and dropped to the floor. ""I truly thought he was dead. I saw the Secret Service pile on top of him like he was the quarterback at a football game."" She was still down when she heard the crowd roar and cheer, and knew then he was OK. Renae Billow and her 11-year-old son and Trump impersonator, Gino Benford, were a few feet away from Lucie and Gino is clearly visible in the Reuters photo, complete with a blond wig and a dark suit. Speaking from the family home in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Gino says he was both scared and calm, ""half and half"", when the shots rang out. ""I thought, who would want to do this to such a great president?"" Reporting from just outside the rally that night, we began to interview people as they left. But one man stood out. He was wearing a Trump hat with fake orange hair sprouting out of it and holding a can of beer. Greg Smith’s words, in which he described how he had seen the gunman on the roof and tried to warn the Secret Service, reverberated around the world. It provided the first hint at the catastrophic security failure and a clip of the interview was viewed by tens of millions of people on social media. Meeting him again this week at his store, just yards from the scene of the shooting, he still feels angry. ""I was very frustrated when I talked to you, extremely frustrated because I think of the time frame. He was on that roof for minutes, crawling, and we were pointing and yelling."" ""I remember thinking 'Why? Why isn't someone doing something? How is this happening? How do I still hear President Trump talking as this is going on?'""  There is also pride in what he did in speaking out. People tell him he is part of history, the first person to tell the world what happened. As someone who usually shuns the limelight, he added: ""I jumped out of my comfort zone and did that. And I'm glad that it went like it did, that everything I told you that night has proven to be true."" Greg, who that day was listening to Trump from outside the rally, does not plan to go to Saturday’s event. He says his 12-year-old son has been traumatised by it, jumping whenever he hears fire works. Despite still feeling angry about the security lapses, Helen Comperatore and her daughters will go back. It's what Corey would have wanted, she says. ""I have tried to do that with everything I do, what would he want me to do? What would Corey do? And that's how I go."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c243zempn6zo,Netanyahu in poll rebound after Hezbollah attacks,"The Israeli PM's party would win the most seats if an election were held but the opposition bloc would have more overall, a poll shows.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s popularity, which was battered after the Hamas attacks on 7 October, has been boosted by his country’s military successes against Hezbollah, a new opinion poll suggests. A picture has been widely shared of the Israeli PM in New York giving the order for the biggest of these - the assassination of the Lebanese armed group’s long-time chief, Hassan Nasrallah. A poll for Israel’s Channel 12, released on Sunday night, indicates the Israeli PM's Likud party would win more seats than any other if a general election was held. However, it did not project a win for him overall, instead suggesting the current opposition parties would have more MPs, enabling them to form a coalition. Fortunately for Netanyahu, his former political rival, Gideon Saar, also joined his fractious coalition government on Sunday, a step that should strengthen the prime minister. “We will work together, shoulder to shoulder, and I intend to seek his assistance in the forums that influence the conduct of the war,” Netanyahu said. Saar will serve as a minister without portfolio with a seat in the Security Cabinet, the body overseeing the management of the war against Israel’s regional enemies. By joining the government with his four-seat party, Netanyahu has a much more solid majority of 68 in the 120-seat parliament. Rumours had swirled in recent weeks that the position of defence minister currently held by the popular, seasoned, former military general Yoav Gallant would go to the relatively less experienced Saar. However, that move seemed to be abandoned as Israel began its series of major strikes against Hezbollah. For Netanyahu, the new composition of the government weakens the power of his National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. The far-right winger has repeatedly threatened to topple the coalition if it goes ahead with a “reckless” deal to end the war in Gaza and bring home hostages or agrees to a permanent ceasefire with Hezbollah. The coalition could now survive without Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power party’s six seats, giving Netanyahu more room for manoeuvre. Once seen as a rising star of Likud, Saar left the party and became one of the most vocal critics of the prime minister arguing that Netanyahu should not continue to serve while battling corruption charges.  He has framed his decision to join the government as an act of patriotism, fostering unity. However, he has been sharply criticised by some Israeli commentators who describe him as acting cynically in his own self-interest. “Saar’s decision to join the government is certainly a painful blow to a large number of Israelis who think that Netanyahu needs to go, and not just because he is being tried on criminal charges, and not just because he is the most corrupt, hedonistic and lying prime minister Israel has ever had,” said Yedioth Ahronoth columnist, Sima Kadmon. She sees that his action “will stabilise and boost the worst government ever to have served in Israel, so much so that the original date of the next elections, October 2026, now appears to be a realistic date"". Certainly, the extra seats could also help solve another challenge facing Israel’s most far-right ever government.  At this sensitive time of war, when the military has a pressing need to expand its ranks, divisions have opened over the passage of a new military conscription law. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled in June that the state must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students into the army. They have historically been exempted, and such a move is vehemently opposed by two ultra-Orthodox parties upon which the coalition depends. Deepening his personal rift with the prime minister, in July, Yoav Gallant approved a plan to begin sending out draft notices to 1,000 18-26-year-olds from the ultra-Orthodox community. A slick political strategist, Netanyahu - Israel’s longest serving leader - did see a big drop in the support for his party in polls at the end of last year. His personal image as “Mr Security” was badly damaged after the 7 October attacks - the deadliest day in Israeli history, when Hamas surprised one of the world’s best intelligence services and the best resourced military in the region took hours to respond. However, by August, opinion polls suggested the prime minister had begun to bounce back. That was despite the invasion of Gaza turning into Israel’s longest ever war with no sign of its objectives being met: the complete destruction of Hamas and bringing home Israel’s remaining hostages. The latest poll gives Likud as many as 25 seats. Altogether coalition parties would be expected to take 49 seats, while opposition parties would win 66. According to the research for Channel 12, Netanyahu also remains the favourite candidate for prime minister over the centrist opposition leader, Yair Lapid - with 38% favouring him over his rival who has 27% support. Much in Israeli politics depends on what happens next as Israel’s multi-front war reaches a critical moment. As Israel hints at a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, tens of thousands of Israeli citizens in the north of the country still do not know when they will return to their homes - an official goal for Israel. If Hezbollah’s main ally Iran decides to attack, the consequences are unpredictable. On the international stage, Israel looks increasingly isolated. International courts are considering whether to put Israel on trial for genocide and have requested an arrest warrant for the prime minister and his defence minister on allegations of crimes against humanity.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20jez2dvw8o,'It didn't have to happen': Wife of man killed at Trump rally struggles with loss,Corey Comperatore was killed in the Trump rally assassination attempt. His wife is furious at the security failures that led to his death.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The wife of a former volunteer fire chief killed during July’s assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, has told the BBC she is furious about the security failures that led to her husband’s killing by a rooftop gunman. Corey Comperatore was shot dead after diving on members of his family to protect them as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire at the former president. His wife Helen said she hasn’t been able to stop replaying the events of the day in her mind. ""I see it every time I close my eyes, and probably will for a long time"" she said. ""I'm angry because there were a lot of mistakes made that day, and it didn't have to happen,” she added. Helen Comperatore spoke exclusively to the BBC just days before Trump is set to return to Butler and the site of the shooting.  The home she shared with Corey in Sarver is less than 20 miles (32 km) from the Butler rally site, and close enough to the volunteer fire station where he worked for decades that when its sirens blare they can be easily heard. Trump will hold a rally on Saturday on the same grounds where he was shot in the ear, before defiantly raising his fist and mouthing “Fight!’, in what has become a defining image of his campaign. Multiple members of the Comperatore family will be Trump's guests at this weekend's rally, including Helen.  Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the July shooting and two other people suffered “life-changing” injuries: 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver. A Secret Service internal review has since identified a litany of security failures that day, including poor planning and a communication breakdown. Corey, who was an ardent supporter of the current Republican presidential candidate, had been excited for the July rally, his wife said. ""He just liked how [Trump] got things done, and that he wasn't a politician and he didn't talk like one."" She said they believe Trump understands the lives of people like them, in places like Butler, a working-class community just north of Pittsburgh. At the rally, the family ended up by happenstance in the bleachers between Trump and the shooter. They'd taken time to eat beforehand and missed the opening to get a seat - to Corey's disappointment. But then a man came by and offered them a spot in the stands. About six minutes into Trump’s speech, Crooks fired eight shots from a roof just outside the rally’s perimeter, one striking Trump’s right ear and one striking and killing Corey as he sheltered his family.  In the months before her husband was killed, the couple spent every weekend on their boat. ""We loved that time together,"" Helen said. ""We talked about everything. We made a lot of future plans on that boat. I knew a lot about Corey and what his wishes were, if anything ever happened to him.""  The couple had known one another their entire lives - they began attending school together as kindergartners. She said her husband often appeared straight-faced and serious, but behind the façade was a deeply kind and caring man. ""As soon as he smiled, you knew he was a good, good man,"" she said. ""He did anything for his community. He loved his kids. His kids were everything to him."" His two daughters, Allyson and Kaylee, are nurses and struggling to get back to work while they grieve their dad, Helen said. She said now the questions of ""What would he want me to do? What would Corey do?"" help guide her. ""It's definitely a struggle. I realised I always knew he took care of me, but I never realised just how much. I just miss him,"" she said. Corey Comperatore was honoured at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July, with his helmet and coat displayed on stage as Trump spoke. Helen said at the July rally, Corey had hoped - and joked - that Trump might call him on stage. The family watched the RNC moment on television, after Trump told Helen about the planned tribute. ""And I just cried because I said he got his moment on stage with Trump,"" she said. ""So, you know, it was kind of like a nice moment, but it was a sad moment at the same time."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr0p1000go,How friends became foes in Africa's diamond state,"Why ex-President Ian Khama, son of the first head of state, is engaged in a row with the current leader.",6 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Ian Khama’s well-mannered voice barely disguises the anger that he feels. In several interviews that Botswana’s former president has given since 2019, when he began to express dissatisfaction with his hand-picked successor, Mokgweetsi Masisi, he has talked about him in damning terms. Masisi was “drunk on power”, Khama told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme five years ago. Since then the 71-year-old has gone into exile, spoken about a plot to poison him and been charged in Botswana with several crimes including money laundering and owning illegal firearms. Having previously dismissed the charges as being “fabricated”, last month he returned home and appeared in court for an initial hearing. The tension between Khama and Masisi is likely to colour the diamond-rich country's imminent general election - just three weeks away - as the former president is actively campaigning for an opposition party. At a further, brief, court appearance on Tuesday, Khama was all smiles. The authorities are now believed to be considering if the case should proceed. There is a strong possibility that things will come to a halt as Khama’s co-accused are no longer facing the charges. But the court will not reconvene until a month after the election. To the outsider, who might have the general feeling that Botswana is one of the continent’s most stable democracies with strong institutions, this dispute between the current and former presidents may seem surprising. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has governed since independence from the UK in 1966. In a constituency-based system, it has dominated parliament for the last five decades though its share of the vote in recent elections has hovered around 50%. The country’s first president, and Khama’s father, Sir Seretse Khama, was descended from royalty and helped cement Botswana’s reputation for orderly government in the 14 years he was in power up to his death in 1980. His 1948 marriage to a white British woman, Ruth Williams, was controversial and led to his exile in the UK. Ian Khama, the couple’s second child, likened his own recent time in South Africa to that of his father’s period away from Botswana. After having been in the military, he went on to become president in 2008, serving for 10 years. Despite the dynastic appeal, the shine came off Khama’s government and in the 2014 election the BDP won less than 50% of the vote for the first time. Concerns about corruption, human rights and the state of the economy - with high levels of unemployment - all dented Khama’s popularity. In the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, funded by Sudanese telecoms mogul Mo Ibrahim, Botswana’s score dropped during his period in power. The country’s huge diamond reserves have proved lucrative and seen the economy grow, but not enough jobs were being created for the young population and the wealth was not being spread around. In 2018, Khama handed over the reins of power to his loyal vice-president, Masisi, perhaps hoping that he could still have some influence, but things soon went awry. One theory is that there was a gentleman’s agreement that Masisi would appoint Khama’s brother, Tshekedi, as vice-president, which he refused to do. Khama began complaining that his security detail was being cut and that democracy within the BDP was being undermined. Masisi also reversed some key policies such as a ban on trophy hunting and ended the scepticism towards having closer relations with China. A year after stepping down as president, Khama then joined the newly formed opposition Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) telling the BBC at the time that the “democracy that we’ve been proud of in this country is now in decline”. He then went into self-imposed exile in late 2021 alleging that there were threats to his life. Masisi has batted away the criticism and earlier this year described the poisoning allegation as “shocking”. “If you look at the history of either killings or murders in Botswana and the methods used, poisoning  is not one of the ones we know best, but of late he [Khama] seems to be an expert,” Masisi told France 24, adding that the former president had nothing to fear. Masisi also said that the arguments Khama has been using against the government and his leadership have been “a litany of inconsistencies”. There is absolutely no chance of reconciliation between the former allies, and Khama is hoping to end the 58 years in power of the BDP - the party his father helped found. There are opportunities to take votes from the government as the problems with the lack of jobs and the accusations of corruption have also dogged the current administration. Furthermore, the former president still commands a lot of respect in the country, especially among the older voters and in his home area around Serowe, where he is paramount chief and where the BPF launched its manifesto at the weekend. But Masisi and the BDP remain in a strong position, especially as the opposition is divided.  The 30 October poll offers an opportunity for the Khama dynasty to once again have an impact on the future of the country. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pg0gnkvxo,Canada's Trudeau survives no-confidence vote in parliament,"While vote to topple his government has failed, it signals a new series of tests for the prime minister.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has survived a motion in parliament aimed at bringing down his government and triggering an election.  Wednesday's no-confidence vote is the first in a series of similar votes expected to be put forward by the opposition Conservative Party amid Trudeau's plummeting approval ratings.  The motion failed after opposition leader Pierre Poilievre fell short in his effort to shore up support from leaders of two other political parties in parliament, the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Bloc Québécois. Trudeau, who has been Canada’s prime minister for nine years, has been leading under a minority government. Voting was held on Wednesday afternoon, on the same day as Trudeau was set to host French President Emmanuel Macron. While this motion has failed, the Conservative party plans to bring at least two other similar no-confidence votes on Thursday in hopes of sending Canadians to the polls.  Trudeau has been facing growing pressure to step down in recent months. His approval rating has plummeted from 63% when he was first elected to 28% in June of this year, according to one poll tracker, amid concerns about housing unaffordability and the rising costs of living. His Liberal party lost two consequential by-elections this summer in Toronto and Montreal. A deal between his party and the NDP has helped him stay in power since Canada’s last federal election in 2021.  But the deal collapsed early in September after NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled out from the coalition, saying that the Liberals are “too weak” and “too selfish” to govern. Trudeau’s leadership has been under threat since, with Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stating that he would put forward a no-confidence vote.  The vote would need the approval of the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass. The Liberal Party, which holds 153 seats, voted against it, while the Conservative Party, which holds 119 seats, voted in favour. The bulk of the other seats are held by the NDP and the Bloc Québécois - both of whose members voted to defeat the motion.  In the end, the motion was defeated by 211 votes against it. Pierre  Polievere, who has been leading in various national polls, had urged fellow MPs to vote in favour of the motion by outlining his vision for Canada under a Conservative government. His plan, he said on Tuesday in parliament, is “to bring home the promise of Canada, of a powerful paycheque that earns affordable food, gas and homes and safe neighbourhoods”. But Singh, the NDP leader, said he would vote against Poilievre’s motion because he believes the Conservative Party will cut social programmes like dental care and pharmacare if it comes to power. The Bloc Québécois - a party whose aim is to represent the interests of Quebec, Canada’s French-speaking province - has said it believes it could work with the Liberal government to secure assurances for Quebec-focused social programmes. Trudeau was at the UN General Assembly earlier this week in New York City, where on  Monday he appeared as a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In his interview with Colbert, Trudeau acknowledged that Canadians were going through “a really tough time” and struggling to afford gas, groceries and rent. But he defended his leadership, saying that his government had invested in Canadians and would continue to do so.  “I’m going to keep fighting,” he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23kg193d8zo,Republican governor candidate treated for burns after 'campaign incident',Mark Robinson's campaign is mired in scandal after reports he had posted racist comments online.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Mark Robinson, the embattled Republican candidate for North Carolina governor, has been treated for burns in hospital after an ""incident"" at a campaign event. His representatives did not detail what had occurred but said Robinson was recovering from second-degree burns and in good spirits after an ""incident at a campaign appearance at the Mayberry Truck Show"". It comes days after several senior advisers resigned from his campaign in the wake of allegations that more than a decade ago the candidate made racist comments on a porn website's message board under the username 'Black Nazi'. Robinson, who is running to be the state’s first black governor and has previously been endorsed by Donald Trump, has denied the reports. Robinson had been attending a campaign event in Mount Airy, a city located near the border of North Carolina and Virginia, at the time of the latest incident. He was taken to hospital and treated for burn injures. Second-degree burns are the most common type of burns. While not as severe as third-degree burns, they are injuries causing pain redness swelling and blistering of the skin. Robinson's representatives said he would resume public campaigning on Saturday. The candidate has been campaigning this week - resisting pressure from state Republicans and also reportedly Trump's team to exit the race. A CNN report published on 19 September said he had posted comments on a porn site's message board more than a decade ago, where he referred to himself as ""black Nazi"" and in one post allegedly said he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama. Robinson, who was elected North Carolina's first black lieutenant governor in 2020, branded the report ""tabloid lies"", and said those postings had not been his words. Days after the report was published, his campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, finance director and senior adviser all resigned. Robinson has previously received direct public support from Donald Trump, who had called him ""Martin Luther King on steroids"", but he has not been seen with the Republican presidential nominee since the release of the report.  Trump has held two rallies in North Carolina since then and on Thursday, when asked if he would withdraw his endorsement he told told reporters: ""I don't know the situation."" Kamala Harris' campaign has also seized on the controversy around Robinson's campaign, releasing a video. Polling has shown Harris and Trump effectively tied among likely voters in the potentially pivotal swing state."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99vlpkzk4no,Trump electric vehicle attacks hit home for Michigan voters,Trump’s EV criticism is part of his broader economic message as he tries to appeal to voters in the key swing state.,3 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A longtime resident of the north Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan, Doug spends part of his days building electric vehicles for Ford as a machine repairman. But he would never buy one. A former Democrat and unionised auto worker, Doug - who declined to share his name for fear of pushback from his union - is exactly the type of Michigan voter Donald Trump is working to recruit and Kamala Harris is eager to win back. With 15 electoral votes, the state is a hefty prize. Biden won it in 2020, by about a three-point lead, or 150,000 votes. But polls show another Democratic victory is far from certain.  With less than a month before election day, the former president has been stoking fears in the state that Harris wants to ban gas-powered vehicles and that auto workers could lose their jobs in the push to electrify cars. The message is resonating with Doug and some other Michigan voters who spoke to the BBC. “It could definitely cost us our jobs, and it already has cost a lot of people their jobs,” Doug told the BBC on a sunny October day outside a Meijer supermarket in Warren. Harris has pushed back on Trump’s rhetoric, telling voters at a rally in Flint, Michigan, last week that her administration would not put a stop to vehicles that use petrol. The vice-president endorsed phasing out petrol cars when she ran for president in 2019, but has since reversed her support for the policy. “Michigan, let us be clear,” she said in Flint, “Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.” Experts say Trump’s electric vehicle criticism is his Michigan spin on a broader economic message as he tries to appeal to voters in the key midwestern swing state. Speaking to a crowd of hundreds at a Detroit Economic Club event on Thursday, the former president doubled down on the message, saying that United Automobile Workers president Shawn Fain wanted “all electric cars”, a move Trump said was costing the auto industry their “whole business”. “That has just become a front message of Republicans: that these plans or hopes to electrify the vehicles are going to destroy the auto industry and take away jobs,” said Jonathan Hanson, a lecturer at University of Michigan’s Gerald R Ford School of Public Policy. And Harris’s challenges to that message haven’t broken through to some Michigan voters, who still believe Trump’s claim that Harris wants a country of entirely electric vehicles. “I don’t trust them,” 82-year-old Warren resident Ruth Zimmer said of electric cars. “I want it to be the way it always was, with a good, old-fashioned car.” On Friday in Michigan, Harris’s running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz tried to appeal to those sceptical of electric vehicles and took aim at Trump’s comments about mandates. “It should just be your choice. We need to make those choices affordable and available to people,” he said. “Nobody’s mandating anything to you. If you want to drive, like I do, a ‘79 International Harvester Scout that is sweet as hell … knock yourself out.” Walz and Trump's visits to the state comes as recent polls suggest Harris’s support may be slipping slightly in the key battleground state. A September poll from Quinnipiac University found Trump ahead by three points in Michigan, after other polls suggested Harris had been leading by a slim margin for the past month. Trump’s attacks on electric vehicles are also complicated by one of his biggest supporters, billionaire Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, an electric car company. Musk has endorsed Trump and appeared at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last week, cheering him on from behind the podium. Appealing to the state’s automobile and union worker population - once a staunchly Democratic voting bloc - will prove key for Harris and Trump to close the gap in Michigan, experts say. Trump picked up a number of these voters in the state in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton, though President Joe Biden won some of their votes back in 2020. Nationally, Clinton ended up winning 51% of union households, compared to Trump’s 42%, in a race she lost in Michigan by some 10,000 votes. Biden won union households 56% to 40%, according to 2020 exit polls. Some former Democratic union workers in Michigan have grown disillusioned with the party as the cost of living has risen. Doug, the Warren resident, said adding that pressure from his union leadership to stay in line with Democrats had turned him off.  “You must be a Democrat, or you're totally exiled,” Doug said. Harris, he added, was just President Joe Biden “in a nutshell”.  The vice-president is struggling to win over the labour vote more than Biden, who had cast himself as the most pro-union president in history. Though Harris and Walz have key labour endorsements, they’ve struggled to earn support from rank-and-file union members. For the first time in three decades, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters - the largest union in the country - declined to endorse a presidential candidate, finding a majority of its rank-and-file members supported Trump. In Michigan, where the automotive and transportation industry employ 20% of the workforce, Democrats are not getting as much credit as they had hoped for their electric vehicle investments in the state, said Matt Grossmann, a politics professor at Michigan State University. This year, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a $1.7b (£1.3b) investment to convert shuttered and struggling auto plants in Michigan and several other mid-western states to manufacture electric vehicles and parts of their supply chain. “Many in the auto industry and surrounding it don't necessarily think that that would benefit Michigan,” Mr Grossmann said. Automakers broadly seem to be on board with shifting their fleets over to more electric vehicles, Mr Hanson said, but the transition is expensive and requires complementary investments in factories for special materials such as batteries. As a part of the nearly $2b federal investment, a General Motors factory in Lansing, Michigan, has received $500m to shift production from petrol to electric vehicles. In Detroit just two days before Trump arrived, his Republican running mate JD Vance said the Lansing investment was “table scraps” compared to the job losses that would be on the horizon from the shift to electric vehicles. Kevin Moore, the president of the Teamsters union in Michigan, called Trump and Vance’s electric vehicle claims a “bold-faced lie”. “They’re not going to get rid of combustible, gas vehicles,” he told the BBC. “They can coincide together.” His group - and several Teamsters unions in swing states - have endorsed Harris for president. Moore said he believed Michigan workers would not buy into Trump’s statement that electrification would cost auto workers their jobs. “They’re astute,” he said of auto workers. “Donald Trump was a gold spoon-fed billionaire. [Harris] lived her life in middle-class America.” EXPLAINER: What Harris or Trump would do in power ANALYSIS: What could be the 'October Surprise'?

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m0z9jwdrgo,Bid to give town its own council is rejected,Wycombe will remain one of the few areas of Buckinghamshire without its own town or parish council.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A bid for a town to have its own council has been rejected over concerns of the cost to taxpayers.  Wycombe will now remain one of the few areas of Buckinghamshire without a town council but will continue to be represented by a committee and community board. Town or parish councils are responsible for services such as allotments, bus shelters and play areas, and can issue fixed penalty fines for litter, graffiti and dog offences. Conservative David Goss, chair of the Standards and General Purposes Committee on Buckinghamshire Council, said: ""There would have been a cost of approximately £200 extra a year on people's council tax and we didn't want to put that extra cost on people."" Independent Stuart Wilson, who supported the plans, said: ""It has always been the intention that Wycombe shouldn't have a town council because there is a fear that Labour would end up in control of it."" In April 2020, a new unitary council was created in Buckinghamshire, meaning the previous district council that served Wycombe was replaced.  It means some decisions on local issues in Wycombe are made by the unitary authority instead. A campaign by Wycombe residents, councillors and former mayors argued that those decisions should be made in the town - an idea supported by the newly elected Labour MP for Wycombe Emma Reynolds. However, although more than 60% of residents who took part in a £35,000 public consultation said they wanted a town council, less than 5% of its 55,000 population actually responded to the survey.  Plus, less than 2% revealed they were prepared to meet the costs of it. Buckinghamshire Council voted to commission a review of the remit and operating arrangements of the High Wycombe Town Committee to ensure it was in a better position to respond to local issues.  It also agreed to look at feedback received from residents about the need for public realm improvements in the town centre. Councillor Goss added: ""We want to make sure the current town committee is fully equipped to deal with the challenges that are facing the High Wycombe area."" There was no right of appeal to the decision - with a further referendum on the subject not now allowed for another two years. Councillor Wilson said: ""There are restrictions in terms of legislation, in terms of being able to raise another petition."" However he suggested the issue may come up in the next May's local council elections, as ""an opportunity for residents of Wycombe to express their point of view"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr542l0j540o,Tanzania opposition leaders detained amid crackdown,Chadema was planning to protest over alleged recent killings and abductions of opposition officials.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Two leaders of Tanzania's main opposition Chadema party are among 14 members who were briefly detained on Monday, as police attempted to block a banned demonstration in the main city, Dar es Salaam.  Chadema said on X that its chairman, Freeman Mbowe, was taken into custody as he was preparing to “lead a peaceful protest”.  Police also went to the home of the party's deputy leader Tundu Lissu with a convoy of 11 vehicles and arrested him, according to Chadema.  Critics fear that the detentions are a sign that the country could be returning to the more repressive rule of the previous President, John Magufuli.  Chadema had planned the demonstrations to protest against alleged recent killings and abductions of opposition officials in the country. Last week, President Samia Suluhu Hassan advised against demonstrations and any related moves, noting that her administration would not tolerate any action that would endanger law and order. Police declared the protests illegal, but the opposition had vowed to defy the ban. Mbowe told journalists shortly before his arrest that “we’re paying the full price of democracy... as opposition leaders we have to show the way"". Local news site The Citizen reported that journalists covering the protest were also being detained.  Early on Monday morning, police blocked access to the homes of the two Chadema leaders in Dar es Salaam and questioned people on whether they were attending the protest, the party said.  Later the same day, Mbowe and Lissu were released on bail, Chadema said, without stating what charges police planned to take them to court with. Since Saturday, riot police had been deployed on key roads in Dar es Salaam. Last year, President Samia lifted a ban on opposition gatherings and pledged to restore competitive politics, but for some, the recent incidents suggest a reversal of the promise of greater political freedom. Rights groups and critics are concerned that the president's tactics are aimed at intimidating her political adversaries as the country nears local government elections this November and the general election in October 2025.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeygy255ewo,Secret Service agent accused of groping aide to Kamala Harris,"The agent allegedly groped the staff member in a hotel room in front of others, reports the BBC's US partner CBS.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A US Secret Service agent has been placed on administrative leave over allegations of sexual misconduct against a member of Vice-President Kamala Harris's staff.  The Secret Service confirmed to the BBC on Wednesday it was investigating an unidentified agent, but did not provide details, adding that it  ""holds its personnel to the highest standard"". The vice-president's office said it had been alerted to the incident and the inquiry, but declined to elaborate. A source confirmed to the BBC the incident involved a Harris aide.  It comes amid growing scrutiny of the law enforcement agency tasked with protecting the president, vice-president and other high-profile officials. The vice-president's office said in a statement to the BBC that ""we have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct"".  The agent under investigation was reportedly on a trip with Harris staff members in Wisconsin last week to work out logistics ahead of a visit by the Democratic presidential nominee.  After dinner and drinks, the agent in question allegedly groped the Harris aide in a hotel room in front of others, according to the BBC's US partner CBS. The agent appeared to be drunk, reports the Associated Press, citing sources. The vice-president's staff and Secret Service officials were in the city of Green Bay last week scouting locations for an event that was due to take place last Friday. Harris, however, opted to go to Atlanta, Georgia, instead. The revelations came as a congressional panel released a scathing report into numerous failures by the Secret Service ahead of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in July. The Republican nominee was put at risk because of a ""foreseeable"" breakdown in communication and co-ordination between law enforcement partners, the Senate Homeland Security committee said. The agency is currently seeking a $3bn (£2.2bn) increase in its annual budget so it can hire more agents, update equipment and expand training to perform its mission in what it calls ""a hyper-dynamic threat environment"". A Gallup poll released on Monday registered a 23-point decline in the percentage of Americans who rate the Secret Service's performance as satisfactory."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62r2y62rwro,The anti-abortion activist urging followers not to support Trump,"Lila Rose says his more moderate stance has made it ""impossible"" to support him. Could it impact who wins the election?",15 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Among the more than 67 million people who tuned in to the first US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris was Lila Rose. The young and charismatic founder of the anti-abortion group Live Action had hoped for big things from the Republican candidate: a bold display of anti-abortion beliefs and a promise to turn those beliefs into law. She was quickly disappointed. While Trump criticised Democrats’ “extreme” abortion policies, he refused to take a position on a national ban, saying instead that the issue should be left to the states.  And he called himself a “leader” on IVF, putting himself at odds with Ms Rose and many in her movement, who oppose the procedure because it often involves destroying embryos. “It was painful to watch,” Ms Rose said of Trump’s performance. Ms Rose, 36, had always had reservations about Trump’s anti-abortion bona fides, after years of shifting positions (including previously declaring himself pro-choice) and his openness to what she called “concerning compromises”. But she, like most in her movement, had been encouraged by his first term and the three Trump-appointed Supreme Court nominees who went on to overturn Roe v Wade and end the nationwide right to abortion. Then Trump changed course, and her disillusionment with the former president swelled. Now on his third White House run, Trump seems to be working to appeal to all sides. He hinted he would sign federal abortion legislation, before later walking it back. He called the state-wide restrictions that came into place after Roe v Wade fell “a beautiful thing”. But later, he said abortion bans early in pregnancy went too far, suggesting Republican candidates needed to be moderate enough on the issue to “win elections”.  This summer, during the Democratic National Convention, the former president posted a statement online saying his future administration would be “great for women and their reproductive rights” - language typically used by pro-choice activists. By late August, Ms Rose had had enough, telling her more than one million followers that Trump was “making it impossible” to vote for him. “It’s very clear that Trump is less pro-abortion than Kamala Harris,” she told the BBC on Thursday. “But our movement’s goal is not just to accept whatever the least worst candidate is and show up for them. Our goal is to help candidates who are going to be fighters for the pre-born.” One of the most prominent leaders in the anti-abortion movement, Ms Rose’s defection signals a potential problem with Trump’s new strategy. As Trump attempts to moderate on abortion, he risks alienating some within his socially conservative base. And in an election that may be decided by a razor-thin margin, if those voters stay home in November it could cost Trump the White House. “When a strategy like that works, you can kind of be anything to everyone,” said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian and expert on the US abortion debate. “And when it stops working you wind up being nothing to everyone.” His campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Trump in 2016, and again in 2020, had held social conservatives close. He embraced anti-abortion activists and championed their movement, becoming the first sitting president to attend the March for Life, the country’s largest annual anti-abortion demonstration. He delivered for social conservatives in a way that few Republican presidents ever had, Ms Ziegler said. “Trump, I think, always understood with his first two races that he would be politically dead in the water without the movement,” she said. “So there was much more catering to them.” In return, these voters turned out overwhelmingly for Trump. In 2020, the former president claimed 84% of white evangelical Christians - some of the most socially conservative voters in the country - up from the already high 77% in 2016. But Trump was reportedly spooked by his party’s underperformance in the 2022 midterm elections - which he and many analysts attributed to the fall of Roe v Wade - and aware of the broad public support for abortion access. So, this time around, Trump has seemed to soften on the issue. By the time the Republican primary elections began at the start of the year, he had started to criticise six-week abortion bans, promising to find a national standard that would please everyone. “Both sides are going to like me,” he said last year. And over the summer, confronted with more questions about what his White House would do on abortion, Trump could not settle on an answer. He indicated he wanted a national “standard” for abortion but has since backed away from any commitment. He said he believed in states’ authority over abortion policy but intervened in several state battles over abortion, often in opposition to social conservatives. He came out against Florida’s six-week abortion ban, saying you “need more than six weeks” and appeared to signal he would vote for a November referendum that would protect abortion in the state. A day later, after intense pressure from anti-abortion activists, he said he would vote against it.  These contortions have strained relationships with key anti-abortion allies. “It’s disconcerting for our students and for our movement,” said Kristan Hawkins, head of Students for Life, one of the largest anti-abortion organisations in the country. “And what I’ve conveyed to the campaign personally is that this strategy is not a winning strategy.” A growing number of voices within the social conservative movement have started to say the same: that by playing to the middle on abortion, Trump may lose must-win voters, without actually attracting anyone new. “The frustration for pro-lifers is that Trump is saying things he thinks might ultimately reach more moderate voters, which frankly is not going to work,” said Matt Staver, founder and chairman of the Florida-based anti-abortion group Liberty Counsel. “And in doing that you’re causing consternation among other voters who are otherwise with you. There’s no point for him engaging in this.” There is no indication that Trump is facing any wide-scale exodus of social conservatives from his party, and both Mr Staver and Ms Hawkins said they would still be casting their ballots for Trump. But in an election that could hinge on a narrow slice of voters, in just a handful of states, some experts say Trump’s abortion wavering could still cost him the election. John Feehery, a Republican strategist, estimated that some 80% of white evangelical Christians - who make up about 14% of the American electorate - need to turn out for Trump to deliver him a win. “I don’t think there’s a danger of white evangelicals voting for Harris, I think there’s a real danger of them not voting,” Mr Feehery said, adding that “10,000 votes” could be enough to tip the scales. That risk could explain the reticence of most anti-abortion leaders to talk publicly about abandoning the Republican candidate. Indeed, some in the movement have expressed frustration with Ms Rose’s position, saying that while Trump is not the ideal candidate, he is still better for their cause than any Democratic opponent. Ms Hawkins of Students for Life has begun to focus her messaging, increasingly, on Harris, telling followers that the harm her administration could do - in the number of abortions alone - would eclipse any missteps by Trump. “I know we’ll be able to work with his administration,” she said. “When you believe, as pro-life activists do, that babies are dying that have a right to be born, I don’t feel I can morally take a position of sitting this out.” But Ms Rose has shrugged off any criticism that her position may inadvertently assist Harris, and her decidedly pro-choice agenda. For her, good enough is not good enough when it comes to abortion, and to Donald Trump. “I know it’s painful for a lot of you guys to hear this, people that want to go out and vote cheerfully for Trump because Kamala Harris is such a disaster… but we have to tell the truth,” she told followers the morning after the debate. “Abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent child,"" she said. ""We need to oppose it loudly.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j7x8lv7jgo,"Harris pushed on Ukraine, debt and if 'mistakes' were made at border",Harris defended Biden-Harris policies as she answered questions on CBS primetime programme 60 Minutes.,7 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris was pressed on issues including the Middle East, Ukraine, gun ownership and immigration during a one-on-one interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes. The recorded interview comes as Harris ramps up media appearances on a series of podcasts and TV networks amid criticism that she has made very few. Donald Trump also was invited to 60 Minutes, but declined. There is less than a month to go before Election Day in the race for the White House between the Democrat and her Republican opponent. The interview on CBS News, the BBC's US partner, aired Monday night after both Harris and Trump appeared at events to commemorate one year since the 7 October attack on Israel. Harris declined to agree when asked by reporter Bill Whitaker whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a ""strong ally"" of the United States, after recent public disagreements between the White House and Jerusalem.  ""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" Harris said. ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people,"" she continued. ""And the answer to that question is yes."" In a more tense moment, Harris also was pressed to defend her immigration record, which has been heavily attacked by Trump and Republicans. Mr Whitaker asked her whether it was a “mistake” to loosen border restrictions put in place during Trump's presidency, given that the Biden-Harris administration re-enacted restrictions three years after taking control of the White House. “It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions,” she said, blaming Trump for pressuring Republicans in Congress to torpedo a border deal that would have increased immigration enforcement. The reporter responded: “What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?” Harris replied that “the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem”. She said that she and Biden have “cut the flow of illegal immigration by half”. On Ukraine, Harris said she would not sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin unless Ukraine was also at the table.  She slammed Trump's position, saying: ""He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender,"" she said.  If Trump was still president, she said, ""Putin would be in Kyiv right now"". She also was asked about her economic plan and how her administration would fund its plans, which could add $3tr (£2.3tr) to the US national deficit over the next decade. ""My economic plan would strengthen America’s economy. His would weaken it,"" she said, adding that her plan relied on ""strengthening small businesses"".  Asked again how she would pay for it, Harris responded that she would raise taxes on ""the richest among us who can afford it"". On Monday, a new analysis by the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found Trump's proposals would increase the US national debt by double the amount of Harris'. Trump would add $7.5tn and Harris would add $3.5tn, the group said. The think tank warned that neither was addressing the country's growing $35.6tn debt. In her interview, Harris also discussed owning a firearm, revealing that her pistol is made by Austrian company Glock.  ""I've had it for quite some time,"" she said, noting that her ""background is in law enforcement"". Harris, a former district attorney in California, laughed when asked if she had ever fired it, saying, ""of course I have, at a shooting range."" Also speaking on the same programme, Harris's running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, criticised Trump for his comments on his opponents and migrants.  ""They're dehumanising, they go beyond weird because, I said this, it becomes almost dangerous. Let's try to debate policy in a real way and let's try to find objective truth again."" He also defended his record of making false statements about his military service and travels in Asia in the 1980s.  Walz described himself as a guy ""telling a story, getting a date wrong"", rather than a ""pathological liar"" like Trump.  ""I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word."" Trump also was invited to 60 Minutes. He accepted, but later changed his mind and declined, according to CBS.  Trump's campaign disputed that he ever agreed to be interviewed. His spokesman, Steven Cheung called it ""fake news"". During his 2020 presidential campaign, Trump walked out of his interview with CBS presenter Leslie Stahl after growing frustrated with questions about Covid-19.  Earlier on Monday, Harris commemorated those killed or taken hostage on 7 October by planting a pomegranate tree at the vice-president’s residence in Washington. “A symbol of hope and righteousness… to remind future vice-presidents of the United States not only of the horror of October 7th but the strength and endurance of the Jewish people,” Harris said. Former President Donald Trump donned a black yarmulke as he visited Ohel Chabad Lubavitch, the final resting place of Rabbi Schneerson in Queens, New York on Monday. The site is considered the holiest Jewish site in North America, according to some Orthodox Jews.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kdx0zx30no,Venezuela's González 'forced' to accept Maduro election win,Edmundo González claims he was coerced into recognising President Nicolás Maduro's victory in disputed elections.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González has said he was ""forced"" to recognise President Nicolás Maduro as the winner of July's disputed election before being allowed to seek asylum in Spain. In a video message, González said Maduro's aides had coerced him into signing a letter while he was hiding in the Spanish embassy in Venezuela's capital Caracas earlier this month.  But Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and a key Maduro ally, said González had willingly written his signature. Electoral authorities loyal to Maduro announced him the victor in the election - something which was disputed by González, and many sections of the international community. In Wednesday's video message from Madrid on X, González, 75, said Maduro's aides had brought him the letter, claiming that ""I had to either sign it or deal with the consequences"". ""There were very tense hours of coercion, blackmail and pressure. ""At that point I considered I could be of more use free than if I were imprisoned,"" González said, describing the signed letter as ""worthless"". González, who has now been granted asylum in Spain, referred to himself as the ""president-elect of millions and millions of Venezuelans who voted for change, democracy and peace"", vowing to ""fulfil that mandate"". Following Gonzalez's statement, Maduro ally Rodríguez presented the letter, which he said was signed by González of his own volition. At a press conference in Caracas on Wednesday, he also gave González ""24 hours"" to take back his assertions, saying that otherwise he would publish audio of their conversations debunking the opposition candidate's claims. “If you signed under pressure how is it that one of your daughters still lives in Venezuela peacefully, with her family, as regular Venezuelans? ""Venezuelans can think in one way or another and all of them have a place in the territory of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Here there's no place for violence or fascism,"" Rodríguez said. He also showed photos of an alleged meeting between himself, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez and González at the Spanish embassy in Caracas on the eve of the opposition candidate's departure earlier this month. Prior to his departure for Spain, a Venezuelan judge had issued an arrest warrant for González, accusing him of conspiracy and of forging documents, among other ""serious crimes"" - all things Gonzalez denied. Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) claims Maduro, 61, won 52% of the vote in the 28 July elections. It gave González 43%. The opposition, however, said it had evidence González had won by a comfortable margin, and uploaded detailed voting tallies to the internet which suggest González beat Maduro convincingly. The US, the EU and the majority of foreign governments have refused to accept Maduro as the winner without Caracas releasing detailed voting data to prove the result. The CNE has said it cannot publish the voting records because the data has been corrupted by hackers."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw5148zkzyo,Vance refuses to answer whether Trump lost 2020 election,The Republican dodged a question during the vice-presidential debate about the poll four years ago.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"JD Vance has refused to say whether he thinks Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and whether he would contest the 2024 vote if Democrats win next month. The Republican vice-presidential candidate - who has previously said he would have challenged the 2020 result if given the chance - avoided giving answers on both issues during Tuesday night's debate. In a head-to-head that was largely civilised in tone, he was accused by his Democratic opponent Tim Walz of ""a damning non-answer"" after sidestepping a question about that result and the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. Trump was seeking a second term then and has spent years making false claims about voter fraud during that poll. The exchange unfolded after the CBS News moderators asked Vance if he would try to challenge the results of November's election, even if every US state governor certified them - as was the case in 2020. Vance did not directly answer, instead saying he was ""focused on the future"". He sought to defend Trump over the riot during which President Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol building in an effort to stop Joe Biden becoming president. Vance said Trump had simply spoken of ""problems"" in 2020, and insisted that Trump had only said that ""protesters ought to protest peacefully"". Turning to the outcome of the 2024 vote, he said: ""If Tim Walz is the next vice-president, he'll have my prayers, he'll have my best wishes, and he'll have my help whenever he wants it."" But Walz persisted with the events of 2020 - challenging Vance to answer whether Trump had lost the poll. When Vance again sought to change the topic, Walz said: ""That is a damning non-answer."" Walz added that they were ""miles apart"" on the issue, despite agreeing on other things during their 90-minute debate. Other than one or two other tussles - including an exchange on immigration that led to the two men's microphones being muted - the debate was polite in tone.  Walz found himself under pressure from the moderators over past comments of his own - marking the latest occasion in which he has fallen foul of fact-checkers. He admitted that he ""misspoke"" when he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. News reports from the time show that he was actually in the US when the events took place in China. Tuesday's event in New York marked the first and only scheduled head-to-head between the pair. Polling by CBS News immediately afterwards suggested that 42% of viewers felt Vance won the debate, compared to 41% who thought Walz came out on top. Some 17% called the debate a tie.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07n811zyp2o,Zelensky looks to Biden to back Ukraine 'victory plan',Kyiv is hoping for a strong show of support from the US leader before he leaves the White House.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"As Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to reveal a “victory plan” to President Joe Biden on Thursday, Kyiv is looking to the US leader for a strong show of support before he leaves the White House. A senior official in Kyiv said they wanted him to “make history” in his final months in office. While details of the Ukrainian plan have been kept under wraps, the strategy is likely to contain pleas for further military and financial support, plus future security guarantees. Zelensky says it is designed to be a “bridge” towards stopping the war, which he believes could end sooner than people think. If the West strengthens Ukraine’s position, he argues Russia’s Vladimir Putin could be pushed into a diplomatic peace. ""This war can't be calmed by talks. Action is needed,"" he told the UN Security Council late on Tuesday. Ever sharp at public relations, Ukraine’s president is also aiming to take on critics in the US who have questioned the wisdom of pouring further money into Ukraine’s cause – by promoting an apparent blueprint for eventual peace. Zelensky is throwing a huge diplomatic effort behind his victory plan.  He is almost camped out at the United Nations. He spoke on Monday at a debate about how the UN should be reformed. He addressed the Security Council on Tuesday. And he is giving a speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday.  In between, he is meeting world leaders and US politicians. He visited an ammunition factory in Scranton, Joe Biden’s hometown in Pennsylvania, one that is making shells for Ukrainian artillery batteries.  And he is explicit that he considers time is short. In one of his many media interviews, Zelensky told the New Yorker that the victory plan had to be agreed - and Ukraine strengthened - in October, November and December.  “This plan is designed, first and foremost, with Biden’s support in mind,” he told the magazine. That support is by no means guaranteed but Zelensky is staking much on securing it.  That is because the situation will change significantly if Donald Trump were to win the election. At a campaign rally on Monday, the former president mocked Zelensky as “the greatest salesman in history” because “every time he comes into this country, he walks away with $60bn”.  Trump restated his position that he would urge Russia and Ukraine to agree a deal to end the war, one that Kyiv fears would force them to accept territorial losses and no guarantee against further Russian aggression.  It is the fear of such a scenario that is pushing the diplomatic drive behind Zelensky’s victory plan this week. Some diplomats are sceptical the plan would succeed in nudging Russia towards a negotiating table. Much depends now on Biden’s response. Congressional lawmakers will be handed the plan as will Trump and his presidential rival Kamala Harris. Trump has claimed he would end the war within 24 hours, leading to fears the Republican nominee would essentially force Kyiv into making territorial concessions against its will. As the US elections loom, it’s a crucial moment for Zelensky as Moscow’s troops continue to press gains, inch by inch, in Ukraine’s east. A top priority in the so-called victory plan will be to “hit Russia strongly”, believes one military analyst - Mykhailo Samus, director of the New Geopolitics Research Network. Giving Kyiv the ability to destroy military infrastructure within a 300km range could seriously hamper the Kremlin’s offensive operations in the Donbas and its ability to “neutralise” Ukraine’s ongoing incursion in Russia’s Kursk region, says Mr Samus. This would mean securing permission, so far denied, to use Western-made long-range missiles on targets deep inside Russia. While Ukraine has successfully been deploying attack drones against Russian ammunition dumps, missiles can penetrate more heavily fortified munition sites. The plan will also see Kyiv ask for more of these kinds of missiles, believes Olga Rudenko, editor in chief of the Kyiv Independent. Further financial support and capitalising on Ukraine’s surprise cross-border push into Russia’s Kursk region are also expected to form core elements within the strategy. As for Ukraine’s future security guarantees, Ukraine’s aspirations towards joining the Nato defensive military alliance clearly remain. “Ukraine’s invitation to Nato is part of the victory plan,” confirmed Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office. Zelensky’s office has rejected a German report that he is considering a localised ceasefire as “fake”. However, Czech President Petr Pavel – who has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine – said this week that part of Ukraine would probably remain “temporarily” occupied, possibly for years. Olga Rudenko believes that, for most Ukrainians, it’s still “too sensitive and unimaginable to concede anything even temporarily to Russia” – even if that conversation is happening somewhere, privately, within government. “It’s not that Ukrainians are greedy about the territory,” she says. “We can’t leave our people there, under Russian control and sentence them to those horrors,” referring to persistent allegations of Russian war crimes. That sentiment was echoed by 31-year-old Dmytro, whose face and arms were badly burned when he was hit by a Russian drone. “We will not surrender our territories, for which so many people have been fallen,” he told the BBC in Kyiv. “If we ended the war at this stage, what were we fighting for then? What for did all our men, our comrades die for?” A truce, he believes, would simply give Russia time to recuperate and Zelensky has likewise warned against a ""frozen"" conflict. Dmytro is already planning his return to the front line to fight alongside his comrades: “I will not retreat, I will be there until my last breath.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0863ry88o,Vance and Walz stick to policy in polite VP debate - but who won?,"The restrained debate was a stark contrast to the fiery showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, writes Anthony Zurcher.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz felt like a civil and relatively restrained conversation about the issues at the top of American voters' minds going into the 5 November election. In that, it was unlike the two presidential debates earlier this year. The two men spent much more time attacking the other's running mate than each other during 90-plus minutes on the CBS News stage in New York. Walz had a shaky start but hit his stride when talking about abortion and the Capitol riot. But the even-tempered, policy-focused debate, with few political body blows, probably served Vance - a polished public speaker - best in the end. If Vance was picked because he puts ideological meat on the bones of Trump’s conservative populism, on Tuesday night he put a polite, humble face on them, as well. “Something these guys do is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes president, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue,” he said. “But in reality, Donald Trump was president. Inflation was low. Take-home pay was higher.""  There were moments when the Republican candidate bristled at what he thought was unfair fact-checking from the two CBS moderators, and at one point microphones of both candidates were temporarily muted.  But for the most part, the exchanges on stage were even-tempered. And there were several moments when the two men agreed on issues – and said so. “There’s a lot of commonality here,” Walz said toward the end of the evening. When Walz spoke of his 17-year-old son witnessing a shooting at a community center, Vance seemed genuinely concerned. “I'm sorry about that and I hope he's doing OK,” he said. “Christ have mercy, it is awful.""  The most vigorous disagreements came toward the end of the debate, on the topic of Trump’s repeated and false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Vance, when asked if Trump lost the last presidential election, dodged the question and criticised what he said was Kamala Harris’s censorship. Walz quickly noted that it was a “damning non-answer”. “To deny what happened on January 6, the first time an American president or anyone tried to overturn an election, this has got to stop,"" he said. “It’s tearing our country apart.” Walz went on to say that the only reason Mike Pence, Trump’s previous vice-president, was not on stage was because he certified President Joe Biden’s victory. Vance had no answer to that, highlighting that beyond his friendly demeanour and agreeability, he would not break from Trump’s position. Vance and Walz entered this debate with different skill sets. Vance has sparred with journalists on television in heated exchanges. Walz is at home on the campaign stump, using his folksy style in contrast to more polished politicians. In the early part of this debate, with both candidates standing behind podiums in a New York City television studio, Vance seemed much more comfortable. His answers were smooth, and relentlessly on-message, constantly reminding the audience that for all of Vice-President Harris’s promises, Democrats have held the White House for the past three and a half years. “If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now,” he said. Walz, for his part, seemed halting and unsure on the opening topic, dealing with Tuesday’s Iranian missile attack on Israel and if the candidates would support an Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran. The Minnesota governor rarely talks about foreign policy, and his discomfort on the subject was apparent. The Democrat settled in as the debate moved along, and during his exchanges with Vance on the topic of immigration - an area of strength for the Republicans - both delivered well-honed messages. Vance deflected accusations that he amplified false claims about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets in Ohio. “The people I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives ruined by Kamala Harris's border policies,” he said.  Vance said undocumented migration burdens city resources, drives up prices and pushes down wages. Walz pointed to Trump’s opposition to proposed bipartisan immigration legislation earlier this year. “I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point, and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanise and villainise other human beings.”  When the topic turned to abortion rights – an area of strength for Democrats, according to polls – it was Vance who played defence, acknowledging that Republicans had to do more to earn the trust of American voters. ""I want us as a Republican Party to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,” he said. “I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. There’s so much we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options.” Walz countered by saying that the Democratic view on abortion was simple: “We are pro-women. We are pro-freedom to make your own choice.” If Walz was more pointed on abortion, he declined to push his attacks when the subject turned to gun control. After Vance said that it was important to increase security in schools, making doors and windows “stronger”, Walz talked up background checks rather than endorsing Democratic calls for bans on assault weapons and other limitations on firearms. As a congressman, Walz regularly voted in favour of gun rights and against many gun control measures, winning the praise of the pro-gun National Rifle Association. During the debate, he said his views on gun control changed after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, but some Democrats may be disappointed he did not press Vance more on Tuesday night.  American political history suggests that vice-presidential debates don’t really matter.  In 1988, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen dismantled Republican Dan Quayle. A few months later, Quayle was sworn in as vice-president after his ticket won in a landslide. It may turn out that this debate is similarly irrelevant to November’s results. Unless there is a last-minute debate announced, however, it will be the last word both parties have on a debate stage before election day. Walz did no harm to the Democratic ticket and showed some of the Midwestern charm that made him Harris’s choice. But Vance’s strong performance is likely to buoy Republicans in the days ahead.  And the debate’s lasting impact may be to convince members of his party that the Ohio senator – who is only 40 - has a future in national conservative politics, given his ability to clearly advance their ideological priorities on the brightest of stages.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyznjz3d78o,Left-leaning leader wins Sri Lanka election in political paradigm shift,Anura Kumara Dissanayake beat his rivals after a historic second round of vote counting.,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has won Sri Lanka’s presidential election after a historic second round of counting. No candidate won more than 50% of the total votes in the first round, where Dissanayake got 42.31% while his closest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, got 32.76%. But Dissanayake, who promised voters good governance and tough anti-corruption measures, emerged as winner after the second count, which tallied voters' second and third choice candidates. The election on Saturday was the first to be held since mass protests unseated the country's leader, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in 2022 after Sri Lanka suffered its worst economic crisis. Dissanayake, 55, told Sri Lankans ""this victory belongs to us all"", in a message on the social media platform X. Once preferences had been tallied, the Election Commission said he had won a total of  5,740,179 votes to Premadasa's 4,530,902.  To revive the economy, Dissanayake has promised to develop the manufacturing, agriculture and IT sectors. He has also committed to continuing the deal struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bail Sri Lanka out of the economic crisis while reducing the impact of its austerity measures on the country’s poorest. Until this weekend's vote, all of Sri Lanka's eight presidential elections since 1982 have seen the winner emerge during the first round of counting. This poll has been described as one of the closest in the country's history. Seventeen million Sri Lankans were eligible to vote on Saturday and the country's elections commission said it was the most peaceful in the country's history. Still, police announced a curfew late Saturday night citing ""public safety"". It was lifted at noon local time (06:30 GMT). Dissanayake promised voters tough anti-corruption measures and good governance - messages that resonated strongly with voters who have been clamouring for systematic change since the crisis. This enabled him to overcome trepidation over the violent past of his political party, the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which carried out two armed insurrections against the Sri Lankan state in the 1970s and 80s. His alliance, the National People’s Power – of which the JVP is a part – rose to prominence during the 2022 protests, known as the Aragalaya – Sinhala for struggle. He has also sought to moderate the hard left stance of his party, in more recent years. Early results showed him rocketing to the lead, prompting several high-profile figures - including the country's foreign minister - to congratulate him. But he lost some ground to Premadasa as voting continued, prompting the need for the second round of counting. Incumbent president Ranil Wickremesinghe won 17% of the vote, putting him in third place in the polling. He was eliminated from the second count, which was only between the two frontrunners. Wickremesinghe congratulated his successor. ""With much love and respect for this beloved nation, I hand over its future to the new president,"" Wickremesinghe said in a statement.  The country's new president will be faced with the twin tasks of reviving the economy and lifting millions from crushing poverty. An economic meltdown fuelled the Aragalaya (struggle) uprising that unseated Rajapaksa from the presidential palace in 2022. At that time, Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves had dried up, leaving the country unable to import essentials such as fuel. Public debt had ballooned to $83bn while inflation zoomed to 70%.   This made basics such as food and medicine unaffordable to ordinary people. The country's economic misery has been blamed on major policy errors, weak exports and years of under-taxation. This was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which choked tourism, a key economic driver. But many people have also blamed corruption and mismanagement, stoking anger against Rajapaksa and his family, who collectively ruled Sri Lanka for more than 10 years.  ""The most serious challenge is how to restore this economy,"" Dr Athulasiri Samarakoon, a political scientist at the Open University of Sri Lanka, told the BBC Sinhala Service. During his term, Wickremesinghe had secured a $2.9bn lifeline from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is crucial to opening additional funding channels, but comes with strict economic and governance policy reforms. Sri Lanka is restructuring the terms of its debt payments with foreign and domestic lenders, as mandated by the IMF. The main focus has been the country's $36bn in foreign debt, of which $7bn is owed to China, its largest bilateral creditor. Like Dissanayake, Premadasa has also pushed for IT, as well as the establishment of 25 new industrial zones.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn5xkp3rko,Bowen: West left powerless as Israel claims its biggest victory yet against Hezbollah,Diplomats were hoping to calm matters - they will be looking at events with dismay.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It is time to stop talking about the Middle East being on the brink of a much more serious war. After the devastating Israeli attack on Lebanon – which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah – it feels as if they’re tumbling over it. It was a huge series of blasts, according to people who were in Beirut. A friend of mine in the city said it was the most powerful she had heard in any of Lebanon’s wars.  As rescue workers searched among the rubble, Hezbollah remained silent on the fate of their leader - before confirming his death on Saturday afternoon. It will reinforce Israel's belief that this is their greatest triumph yet against their great enemy. They have mobilised more soldiers, and seem to want to pick up the pace. They may even be thinking about a ground incursion into Lebanon. It is a massively escalatory action. Over the last eleven months there has been an ongoing tit-for-tat between both sides, though with more pressure from the Israelis. But now they have decided they are going to push. They will be delighted with what they have done because – unlike the war against Hamas, which they did not expect – they have been planning this war since 2006. They are now putting those plans into effect. There are now huge challenges for Hezbollah. Their rockets landed again in Israeli territory on Saturday morning, targeting areas further south, so they are pushing back, but this is an uncertain period. That uncertainty is part of the danger. The predictability of the war of attrition that went on for months and months meant people knew where they were - they absolutely do not now. Earlier on Friday there had been hopes, admittedly faint ones, that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was at least prepared to discuss a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. It came from the US and France and was backed by Israel’s most significant Western allies. But in a typically defiant and at times aggressive speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu did not talk about diplomacy. Israel, he said, had no choice but to fight savage enemies who sought its annihilation. Hezbollah would be defeated – and there would be total victory over Hamas in Gaza, which would ensure the return of Israeli hostages. Far from being lambs led to the slaughter – a phrase sometimes used in Israel to refer to the Nazi Holocaust – Israel, he said, was winning. The huge attack in Beirut that occurred as he finished his speech was an even more emphatic sign that a truce in Lebanon was not on Israel’s agenda. It seemed more than feasible that the attack was timed to follow up Mr Netanyahu’s threats that Israel could, and would, hit its enemies, wherever they were. The Pentagon, the US defence department, said it had no advance warning from Israel about the raid. A photo released by the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem showed him at a bank of communications equipment in what looked like his hotel in New York City. The image’s caption said it showed the moment that he authorised the raid. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the policy he has worked on for months. He said there was still room for negotiation. That assertion is looking hollow. The Americans have very few levers to use against any side. They cannot, by law, talk to Hezbollah and Hamas as they are classified as foreign terrorist organisations. With the US elections only weeks away, they are even less likely to put pressure on Israel than they have been in the last year. Powerful voices in the Israeli government and military wanted to attack Hezbollah in the days after the Hamas attacks last October. They argued that they could deal their enemies in Lebanon a decisive blow. The Americans persuaded them not to do it, arguing that the trouble it might set off across the region offset any potential security benefit for Israel. But in the course of the last year Netanyahu has made a habit of defying President Joe Biden’s wishes about the way Israel is fighting. Despite providing Israel with the aircraft and bombs used in the raid on Beirut, President Biden and team were spectators. His policy for the last year, as a lifelong supporter of Israel, was to try to influence Netanyahu by showing solidarity and support, delivering weapons and diplomatic protection. Biden believed that he could persuade Netanyahu not just to change the way Israel fights – the president has said repeatedly that it is imposing too much suffering and killing too many Palestinian civilians – but to accept an American plan for the day after that rested on creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Netanyahu rejected the idea out of hand and has ignored Joe Biden’s advice. After the attack on Beirut, Blinken repeated his view that a combination of deterrence and diplomacy had staved off a wider war in the Middle East. But as events spiral out of US control, he is not sounding convincing. Big decisions lie ahead. First of all, Hezbollah is going to have to decide how to use its remaining arsenal. Do they try to mount a much heavier attack on Israel? If they don’t use their remaining rockets and missiles in storage, they might decide Israel will get around to destroying even more of them. The Israelis also face highly consequential decisions. They have already talked about a ground operation against Lebanon, and while they haven’t yet mobilised all the reserves they might need, their military said on Saturday that they were “ready for a wider escalation”.  Some in Lebanon believe that in a ground war Hezbollah could negate some of Israel’s military strengths. Western diplomats, among them Israel’s staunchest allies, were hoping to calm matters, urging Israel to accept a diplomatic solution. They will now be looking at events with dismay and also a sense of powerlessness."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrm8r1k8nzo,France's Mr Africa spills the beans on secret cash,"Long a confidant of French and African leaders, Robert Bourgi lifts the lid on post-colonial relations.",29 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It was January 1988 and Robert Bourgi was waiting to see the Gabonese president Omar Bongo, in an antechamber at his seaside palace in Libreville. He was there to collect funds for the approaching French presidential election on behalf of the centre-right Gaullist candidate Jacques Chirac, who was mayor of Paris at the time. Who should then be ushered into the same antechamber but Roland Dumas, former French foreign minister and right-hand man of ruling Socialist President François Mitterrand, Chirac’s arch-rival. “Good day, Bourgi,” said Dumas. “I believe we are here for the same purpose.” Claiming seniority, Dumas went into Bongo’s office first. Emerging a short time later, he said to Bourgi: “Don’t worry, there’s still a bit left!” Recounted in Bourgi’s newly-published memoirs They know that I know it all - My life in Françafrique,  the anecdote says everything about the money-grabbing and mutual dependence that for so long linked French and African politics. For four decades Robert Bourgi was at the centre of it all. Born in Senegal in 1945 to Lebanese Shiite parents, he rose to become a confidant of a generation of African leaders – from Omar Bongo in Gabon to Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville and Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso. And in Paris, he inherited the mantle of the legendary Jacques Foccart – the Gaullist who oversaw the post-colonial Françafrique system, with its arrangements of influence and protection, markets, materials, muscle… and money. From the early years after World War Two – during which it had been a centre of activism in favour of France’s post-war leader Charles de Gaulle - Africa and its former French colonies had been a source of financing for all French political parties. By the 1980s, when Bourgi came onto the scene, it was routine. Bourgi says that he himself never imported the bags of cash. “The procedure was simple. When there was an election approaching, Chirac made it clear that I should deliver a message in various African capitals,” he said in an interview in Le Figaro newspaper this week. “The [African] heads of state then sent an emissary to my office in Paris with a large sum. Several million in francs or dollars.” In each of the 1995 and 2002 presidential elections – both won by Chirac – he says around $10m (£7.5m) was given by African leaders. The 2002 race provided Bourgi with another colourful story, when a representative of Burkinabè leader Blaise Compaoré arrived in Paris with a large sum of money concealed in djembe drums. According to Bourgi, he accompanied the envoy to the Elysée Palace, where they were greeted by Chirac. They opened the sealed drums using a pair of scissors, upon which a rain of banknotes fell out. “Typical Blaise,” Bourgi quotes Chirac as saying. “He’s sent us small denominations.”  The money was apparently all in fives and tens. Handling the cash was not always easy. Remembering a big donation to Chirac from another African leader, Bourgi says: “The money arrived in Puma sports bags. I wanted to put the wads in paper so I went into my daughter’s room and took down one of her posters, and wrapped the money in that.” The system was so widespread that it gave rise to a verb cadeauter – from the French cadeau, meaning a present. When Bourgi’s allegations first surfaced in 2011 they were denied by officials in Burkina Faso and elsewhere, although a former presidential adviser in Ivory Coast conceded they were “historical practice”. Chirac and his then chief of staff Dominique de Villepin also strenuously denied Bourgi’s claims. A preliminary investigation was opened but later dropped without further action, because the payments were considered too long ago. For African leaders at the time, says Bourgi, it was normal, and they did it among themselves. Giving large sums of money was a way of establishing trust and support. But in a changing world it was unsustainable and Bourgi says he grew disillusioned.  Nicolas Sarkozy came to power in 2007 vowing not to take a single franc from Africa, and Bourgi says he kept to his word. Sarkozy has since been placed under investigation for allegedly taking campaign funds from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi - which he denies. Bourgi, a Sarkozy loyalist, says he does not believe the charges. The former lawyer, now aged 79,  also reflects on his rather different role in another election - that of Emmanuel Macron in 2017.  That was when Bourgi helped scupper the chances of the man who was for a time the runaway favourite, the conservative François Fillon. Once close to Fillon, Bourgi had become estranged: he accused the former prime minister of being rude and stingy.  So he released to a journalist the fact that he had made Fillon a gift of two very expensive suits.     Campaigning on a message of probity, Fillon never recovered. Later he was convicted of giving a fake parliamentary job to his British wife. But Africa is Bourgi’s love.   He reflects that though the corruption at the heart of Françafrique was wrong, the system at the time brought stability, and a bond - often personal - between French and African leaders. Today, that is gone.   France has a worsening image in its former colonies, and its influence is on the wane.  Witness the recent retreat from its former army bases in Mali and Niger. “I note with sadness the disintegration of French relations with the continent,” Bourgi says. “But it is too easy to put all the blame on Françafrique… Africa has globalised. France has been unable to adapt to this new fact.  And it keeps making the same mistake: arrogance.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dpnj3en99o,Rival to India's Modi bailed after five months in jail,Arvind Kejriwal has always rejected corruption allegations and called them political vendetta.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"India's top court has granted bail to prominent opposition leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal more than five months after he was arrested in a corruption case. A former anti-corruption crusader, he was jailed in connection with a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy.  Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) introduced the policy in November 2021, saying it would curb black market sales, increase revenues and ensure even distribution of liquor licences. It was withdrawn a few months later after Delhi’s Lieutenant-Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena accused AAP of exploiting rules to benefit private liquor barons. Mr Kejriwal and AAP deny the charges. They said the allegations were ""politically motivated"". On Friday, a Supreme Court bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan granted Mr Kejriwal bail and directed him to refrain from making any public comments. The court also directed Mr Kejriwal to refrain from attending office or signing any official files. The judges said they had decided to grant him bail since charges had been framed and the trial was unlikely to be completed sometime soon, legal website Live Law reported. Mr Kejriwal was released on interim bail for three weeks in May to campaign for the parliamentary elections on the condition that he would abstain from his official duties as chief minister. Mr Kejriwal was the third AAP leader arrested in the case. His former deputy, Manish Sisodia, was granted bail in August after 17 months in jail. Another AAP leader, Sanjay Singh, was released on bail in April. Critics of India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have often alleged that it has used investigating agencies to unjustly target opposition leaders, a charge it denies. Mr Kejriwal’s arrest in March just weeks before key parliamentary elections had drawn comments from the US and Germany. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller had said Washington was closely monitoring his arrest and actions taken against opposition parties in India – drawing ""strong objection"" from Delhi.  A mechanical engineer, Mr Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay prize – often called Asia’s Nobel – in 2006 for popularising the Right to Information law that allows citizens to access information from the government. But he gained national prominence following massive anti-corruption protests in 2011 against the then governing Congress party.  Inspired by the campaign's success, he founded the AAP, pledging to eradicate corruption and to take on the Congress and the BJP. AAP made its poll debut in 2013 Delhi Assembly elections and has governed the capital city since, focussing on welfare measures such as affordable electricity and water for residents. His party has since contested multiple parliamentary and assembly elections across the country with limited success. Besides Delhi, the party is in power in Punjab. It is also now a part of INDIA, a loose bloc of opposition parties led by the Congress."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl05rp8r1o,The 91-year-old African president who keeps defying death rumours,"Cameroon's Paul Biya, 91, has not been seen for about a month, sending the rumour mill into overdrive.",5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Speculation over the wellbeing and whereabouts of Cameroon’s 91-year-old President Paul Biya has become a hot topic across Africa this week. After attending the China-Africa summit in Beijing in early September, it was perhaps no surprise that he gave the UN General Assembly in New York a miss.  But when he stayed away from this week’s summit of French-speaking countries (La Francophonie) at Viller Cotterêts, north of Paris, the rumour mill went into overdrive, as he had not been seen in public for about a month. Cameroon’s ambassador in France insisted that Biya was “in good health” and in Geneva - his habitual base when away from home. Other sources suggested this was because he needed to rest under medical supervision after a heavy diplomatic schedule in July and August.  After all, he is Africa’s oldest head of state and the second longest-serving, narrowly beaten to that record by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema of neighbouring Equatorial Guinea. Such mundane indications were not enough to still speculative guesswork about Biya in Africa-interested media and political circles. So finally the government spokesman, René Sadi, issued a formal denial of the rumours, adding that the president would return home ""in the next few days"".   And the head of the president's private office, with him in Geneva, also said he was “in excellent health”. Cameroon occupies a key strategic location, as the gateway to landlocked Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR). Apart from struggling to fully suppress jihadist violence around Lake Chad, it also wrestles with a complex and often violent crisis in its English-speaking regions. In leading the response to these challenges, Biya has brought an unusual personal style that often eschews the front of the stage, without any apparent personal need to engage in diplomatic presenteeism or performative summitry.  He is a habitual non-attendee at many gatherings of African leaders. Even back home, with his measured speech and cautious tone, Biya has for many years spaced his personal interventions, largely delegating the day-to-day running of the government, and handling of technical dossiers, to a succession of prime ministers. Unexplained absences from public view have been nothing out of the ordinary for this most enigmatic of presidents. Rumours that he has died do surface from time to time, largely because of these unannounced disappearances from the scene. But this low-key style belies the determination with which he contrived his arrival in power in 1982, elbowing aside his patron and predecessor Ahmadou Ahidjo, promising liberalising change before entrenching a hold on the presidency that no subsequent challenger or campaign of protest has managed to shift. As a wave of multi-party democratising change swept across much of Africa at the beginning of the 1990s, Biya was one of several incumbent leaders to shrewdly adapt, allowing sufficient reform to take the heat out of mass protest while nevertheless firmly keeping control.  Since one narrow election victory back in 1992, he has shrugged off subsequent political challenges, helped perhaps by manipulation of the polls and certainly by the divisions among often tactically inept opponents. Now, with Biya’s current seven-year term drawing to an end in November 2025, supporters have even been pressing the 91-year-old to stand again. Critics feel that it is long past time for Cameroon’s national leadership to pass to a younger generation who could tackle national problems and explore opportunities for development and progress with more speed and dynamism. In 2016 teachers and lawyers in the two mainly English-speaking regions, South-West and North-West, protested over the failure to properly resource English language rights and public services. If Biya had responded more rapidly and with a more assertively generous and loudly touted reform package, perhaps he could have assuaged discontent early on - and thus averted the eventual slide into violent confrontation between the security forces and armed militants demanding outright secession. Biya did later bring forward reforms – to meet the grievances of the English-speaking regions and, nationwide, to decentralise power to regional councils.  But sometimes citizens have faced long waits before the regime addresses their concerns - decentralised structures were not set up until many years after the original framework legislation had been passed. Some Cameroonians are, however, comfortable with Biya’s restrained approach to leadership and his readiness to leave successive prime ministers to handle routine decisions.  They see his role as more symbolic and distant, akin almost to a constitutional monarch. Certainly, this representational role is a dimension of the presidency with which he has seemed at ease.  On 15 August, for example, he was at Boulouris, on the Côte d’Azur in France, where he gave a detailed 12-minute address at the commemoration of the 1944 Allied landings to liberate southern France from the Nazis - an operation in which many troops from the French African territories took part. And in fact, despite frequent absences from the Cameroonian capital Yaoundé - usually retreating either to his home village in the forested south or to his preferred international base, Geneva’s Intercontinental Hotel - Biya has continued to take the key sensitive political and strategic decisions.  The main gatekeeper to the heart of power at the Étoudi presidential palace is the Secretary General of the Presidency, Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh. A power system where Biya, as the head of state, keeps his cards so close to his chest inevitably generates gossip about his own intentions for the 2025 election and about potential successors.  But some of the senior regime figures most frequently tipped, such as Laurent Esso and René Sadi, are by now themselves far from youthful. Support groups have also appeared to promote a passing of the torch to the president’s elder son Franck Biya, a businessman – although Franck himself has never shown any interest in politics or given any hint of such ambitions. But in today’s Africa, where disenchantment with the political establishment runs deep, particularly among young urban populations, establishment attempts to secure the continuation of power can carry risks. In neighbouring Gabon, President Ali Bongo was deposed by the army last year after the regime manipulated the 2023 election to deliver him a further seven-year term despite his fragile state of health. And when Senegal’s President Macky Sall lined up his Prime Minister Amadou Ba as his successor, he was decisively rebuffed by the voters who opted instead for the young reformist opponent Bassirou Diomaye Faye. Biya and his inner circle may feel confident of avoiding such scenarios. But that will require a shrewd reading of popular sentiment, especially among youth and the middle-class in big cities such as Yaoundé and Douala.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdenlej471po,US jury acquits all but one in 'Trump train' trial,Six Trump supporters were accused of intimidating a Biden campaign bus on a Texas highway four years ago.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A jury in Texas has cleared five pro-Trump activists but found one liable in a civil trial over a 2020 incident in which they surrounded a Joe Biden campaign bus on the highway. Motorists aboard the bus had accused the six defendants of violating state laws and a federal law used to counter the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group. After a two-week trial, jurors ordered Eliazar Cisneros to pay $40,000 (£30,000) in damages for conspiring to intimidate the campaign and disrupt its activities. But no liability was found on the part of his co-defendants Stephen and Randi Ceh, Joeylynn and Robert Mesaros or Dolores Park. John Paredes, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling is ""especially significant in today’s climate of heightened political tension, and sends a strong signal to all Americans that anyone who engages in acts of political intimidation or violence in this upcoming election or any other election will be held accountable"". But the five acquitted Texas residents, who have long presented the case as politically motivated, also hailed the result of the trial. Co-defendant Mrs Mesaros told reporters outside court that she and her husband had felt ""like zoo animals in the cage and mischaracterised and misrepresented, and we're just ready to feel like normal people again"". Nearly four years ago, the six defendants participated in a so-called ""Trump train"" - a caravan of the Republican nominee's supporters in their vehicles - that swarmed Biden's campaign bus as it travelled along the Interstate 35 highway. Video footage of the incident appears to show roughly three dozen cars and trucks occupying every lane and swerving through traffic to box the bus in and slow it down to a crawl before driver Timothy Holloway makes an abrupt exit to lose them. Mr Holloway and two passengers - former Biden campaign staffer David Gins and former Democratic state senator Wendy Davis - sued in 2021 over what they called an act of political violence. Three Biden campaign events in the area were cancelled following the incident, which involved at least one collision. Trump praised those involved at the time with a social media post proclaiming: ""I LOVE TEXAS!"" Lawyers on the case cited potential violations of Texas statutes on civil assault and civil conspiracy but also invoked the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 to ""reaffirm that threats, intimidation, and force have absolutely no place in American politics"". Prosecutors have wielded the long-disused federal statute in recent years amid a climate of heightened political polarisation. Monday's ruling marks the first time it has found a defendant liable in the modern era. While the Trump supporters acknowledged they had participated in the Trump train and many similar convoys, they denied pre-planning the event or intending to harm those on the bus. Jurors were shown evidence, however, that Mr Cisneros, a US Navy veteran, helped come up with the idea to ""escort"" the bus. The seven-member panel ruled that he must pay $30,000 in damages to the three plaintiffs and an additional $10,000 to the driver, Mr Holloway. An attorney for Mr Cisneros said he plans to appeal. Last year, two original co-defendants in the case privately settled the case and issued public apologies. The city of San Marcos also paid out $175,000 to the plaintiffs last year over allegations that local law enforcement failed to provide help in spite of repeated pleas to 911 for a police escort."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2439n8mr31o,'I'm a capitalist' says Harris in economic pitch to voters,"Harris is seeking to chip away at Donald Trump's advantage with voters on the economy, a key election issue.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris, seeking to sharpen her economic message, pledged to usher in new investments in domestic manufacturing across a range of industries if elected to the White House in November. In a speech in the must-win state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Harris cast herself as ""a capitalist"" with a pragmatic approach to boosting the middle class. An hour before the speech, her Republican rival Donald Trump touted his own economic agenda - including a 15% made-in-America tax proposal - while visiting North Carolina.   Both candidates are campaigning in battleground states this week on their competing visions for the economy, a key issue that voters say is a top priority in casting a ballot. In a tacit rebuttal to Republican claims that she supports ""communist"" policies, Harris described herself as ""a capitalist"".  ""I promise you I will be pragmatic in my approach,"" she said at an event hosted by The Economic Club of Pittsburgh. Building on her vision for an ""opportunity economy"", Harris laid out new proposals to help young families, first time homebuyers and the elderly through $100bn worth in tax breaks and financial incentives. She vowed new investments in artifical intelligence, aerospace and energy development. Harris added, however, that tax rates for large corporations and the wealthiest Americans must rise so they ""pay their fair share"". She also promised to reform permitting to speed up building in the US, eliminate college degree requirements for federal jobs and increase union apprenticeships, if elected. “I intend to chart a new way forward and grow America’s middle class” she argued, while Trump has “no intention to grow our middle class — he’s only interested in making life better for himself and people like himself”. Later in her first major solo interview with MSNBC, Harris lambasted Trump, saying he ""isn't very serious"" on his tariff proposals and ""constantly got played by China"". “You don’t just throw around the idea of tariffs across the board,"" she said. ""He’s just not serious about very many of these issues."" Harris also pushed back for the first time on the Trump campaign's claim that she is lying about having worked at McDonald's as a university student. ""Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family,"" she said. ""I worked there as a student."" Harris's remarks came as she is seeking to chip away at Trump's advantage with voters on his handling of the economy.  Though the race remains close, Harris has opened up a narrow lead in national polling since the two candidates met on a debate stage earlier this month. At a campaign event in Mint Hill, North Carolina, Trump defended his tariff proposals and suggested they were the reason ""people in [other] countries want to kill me"". “I’m imposing tariffs on your competition from foreign countries, all these foreign countries that have ripped us off, which stole all of your businesses and all of your jobs years ago,” he said. He reminded supporters that, as president, he had passed the largest corporate tax cut in US history, from 35% to 21%. The centrepiece of his second term, he said, would be a ""manufacturing renaissance"" ushered in by a 15% tax rate for products made in America. The economy routinely emerges as the top issue for voters this November and both candidates have touted populist policies, with Harris appearing to mirror a Trump proposal to end taxation on service workers' tips. In her sitdown with MSNBC, Harris said that ""Donald Trump has a history of taking care of rich people"". ""I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share,"" she added, arguing that Trump advocates ""tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country"". ""My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America’s economy is stronger, and there’s empirical evidence to prove my point correct."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dd9rj3vmyo,The 'mastermind' behind India's biggest jailbreak,"Nearly 20 years ago, 389 men escaped from an Indian jail, led by a man believed to have planned the breakout.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"On a quiet Sunday evening in November 2005, a journalist in India's Bihar state received a panicked phone call at home. “The Maoists have attacked the prison. People are being killed! I’m hiding in the toilet,” an inmate gasped into the mobile phone, his voice trembling. The sound of gunshots echoed in the background. He was calling from a jail in Jehanabad, a poverty-stricken district and, at the time, a stronghold of left-wing extremism. The crumbling, red-brick, colonial-era prison overflowed with inmates. Spread across an acre, its 13 barracks and cells were described in official reports as ""dark, damp, and filthy"". Originally designed for around 230, it held up to 800 prisoners. The Maoist insurgency, which began in Naxalbari, a hamlet in West Bengal state in the late 1960s, had spread to large parts of India, including Bihar. For nearly 60 years, the guerrillas - also called Naxalites - have fought the Indian state to establish a communist society, the movement claiming at least 40,000 lives. The Jehanabad prison was a powder keg, housing Maoists alongside their class enemies - vigilantes from upper caste Hindu private armies. All awaited trial for mutual atrocities. Like many Indian prisons, some inmates had access to mobile phones, secured through bribing the guards. “The place is swarming with rebels. Many are simply walking out,"" the inmate - one of the 659 prisoners at the time - whispered to Mr Singh. On the night of 13 November 2005, 389 prisoners, including many rebels, escaped from Jehanabad prison in what became India's - and possibly Asia's - largest jailbreak. At least two people were killed in the prison shootout, and police rifles were looted amid the chaos. The United States Department of State's 2005 report on terrorism said the rebels had even ""abducted 30 inmates"" who were members of an anti-Maoist group.  In a tantalising twist, police said the “mastermind” of the jail break was Ajay Kanu, a fiery rebel leader who was among the prisoners. Security was so lax in the decrepit prison that Kanu stayed in contact with his outlawed group on the phone and through messages, helping them come in, police alleged. Kanu says this is not true. Hundreds of rebels wearing police uniforms had crossed a drying stream behind the prison, climbed up and down the tall walls using bamboo ladders and crawled in, opening fire from their rifles. The cells were open as food was being cooked late in the kitchen. The rebels walked to the main gates and opened them. Guards on duty looked on helplessly. Prisoners - only 30 of the escapees were convicts, while the rest were awaiting trial - escaped by simply walking out of the gates, and disappeared into the darkness. It was all over in less than an hour, eyewitnesses said.  The mass jail break exposed the crumbling law and order in Bihar and the intensifying Maoist insurgency in one of India’s most impoverished regions. The rebels had timed their plan perfectly: security was stretched thin due to the ongoing state elections. ___ Rajkumar Singh, the local journalist, remembers the night vividly. After getting the phone call, he rode his motorbike through a deserted town, trying to reach his office. He remembers the air was thick with gunshots ringing in the distance. The invading rebels were also trying to attack a neighbouring police station. As he turned onto the main road, dim streetlights revealed a chilling sight - dozens of armed men and women in police uniforms blocking the way, shouting through a megaphone. “We are Maoists,” they declared. “We’re not against the people, only the government. The jailbreak is part of our protest.” The rebels had planted bombs along the road. Some were already detonating, collapsing nearby shops and spreading fear through the town. Mr Singh says he pressed on, reaching his fourth-floor office, where he received a second call from the same prisoner. “Everyone’s running. What should I do?,” the inmate said. “If everyone’s escaping, you should too,” Mr Singh said. Then he rode to the prison through the eerily empty streets. When he reached, he found the gates open. Rice pudding was strewn all over the kitchen, the cell doors were ajar. There was no jailor or policeman in sight.  In a room, two wounded policemen lay on the floor. Mr Singh says he also saw the bloodied body of Bade Sharma, the leader of the feared upper caste vigilante army of landlords called Ranvir Sena and a prisoner himself, lying on the floor. The police later said the rebels had shot him while leaving. Lying on the floor and stuck to the walls were blood-stained handwritten pamphlets left behind by the rebels. “Through this symbolic action, we want to warn the state and central governments that if they arrest the revolutionaries and the struggling people and keep them in jail, then we also know how to free them from jail in a Marxist revolutionary way,” one pamphlet said. ___ A few months ago, I met Kanu, the 57-year-old rebel leader the police accuse of masterminding the jailbreak, in Patna, Bihar’s chaotic capital. At the time of the incident, media reports painted him as ""Bihar’s most wanted"", a figure commanding both fear and respect from the police. Officers recounted how the rebel “commander” instantly took control during the prison break once he was handed an AK-47 by his comrades.  In a dramatic turn, the reports said, he “expertly” handled the weapon, swiftly changing magazines before allegedly targeting and shooting Sharma. Fifteen months later, in February 2007, Kanu was arrested from a railway platform while he was travelling from Dhanbad in Bihar to the city of Kolkata. Almost two decades later, Kanu has been acquitted in all but six of the original 45 criminal cases against him. Most of the cases stem from the jailbreak, including that of the murder of Sharma. He has served seven years in prison for one of the cases. Despite his fearsome reputation, Kanu is unexpectedly talkative. He speaks in sharp, measured bursts, downplaying his role in the mass escape that made headlines. Now, this once-feared rebel is subtly shifting his gaze toward a different battle - a career in politics, “fighting for poor, backward castes”. As a child, Kanu spent his days and nights listening to stories from his lower-caste farmer father about Communist uprisings in Russia, China and Indonesia. By eighth grade, his father’s comrades were urging him to embrace revolutionary politics. He says his defiance took root early - after scoring a goal against the local landlord’s son in a football match, armed upper-caste men stormed their home. “I locked myself inside,” he recalls. “They came for me and my sister, ransacking the house, destroying everything. That’s how the upper castes kept us in check - through fear."" In college, while studying political science, Kanu ironically led the student wing of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has waged a war against Maoism. After graduation, he co-founded a school, only to be forced out by the owner of the building. Upon returning to his village, tensions with the local landlord escalated. When a local strongman was murdered, Kanu, just 23, was named in the police complaint - and he went into hiding. “Since then I have been on the run, most of my life. I left home early to mobilise workers and farmers, joined and went underground as a Maoist rebel,” he said. He joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), a radical communist group. “My profession was liberation - the liberation of the poor. It was about standing up against the atrocities of the upper castes. I fought for those enduring injustice and oppression.” ___ In August 2002, with a feared reputation as a rebel leader and a 3m-rupee ($36,000; £27,000) bounty on his head - an incentive for people to report his whereabouts if they spotted him - Kanu was on his way to meet underground leaders and plan new strategies. He was about to reach his destination in Patna when a car overtook him at a busy intersection. “Within moments, men in plainclothes jumped out, guns drawn, ordering me to surrender. I didn’t resist - I gave up,"" he said.  Over the next three years, Kanu was shuffled between jails as police feared his escape. “He had a remarkable reputation, the sharpest of them all,” a senior officer told me. In each jail, Kanu says he formed prisoner unions to protest against corruption - stolen rations, poor healthcare, bribery. In one prison, he led a three-day hunger strike. “There were clashes,” he says, “but I kept demanding better conditions"". Kanu paints a stark picture of the overcrowding in Indian prisons, describing Jehanabad, which held more than double its intended capacity. “There was no place to sleep. In my first barrack, 180 prisoners were crammed into a space meant for just 40. We devised a system to survive. Fifty of us would sleep for four hours while the others sat, waiting and chatting in the dark. When the four hours were up, another group would take their turn. That’s how we endured life inside those walls."" In 2005, Kanu escaped during the infamous jailbreak. “We were waiting for dinner when gunfire erupted. Bombs, bullets - it was chaos,"" he recalls. “The Maoists stormed in, yelling for us to flee. Everyone ran into the darkness. Should I have stayed behind and been killed?” Many doubt the simplicity of Kanu's claims. ""It wasn’t as simple as he makes it sound,"" said a police officer. ""Why was dinner being prepared late in the evening when it was usually cooked and served at dusk, with the cells locked up early? That alone raised suspicions of inside collusion."" Interestingly many  of the prisoners who escaped were back in jail by mid-December - some voluntarily, others not. None of the rebels returned. When I asked Kanu whether he masterminded the escape, he smiled. “The Maoists freed us - it’s their job to liberate,” he said. But when pressed again, Kanu fell silent. The irony deepened as he finally shared a story from prison. A police officer had once asked him if he was planning another escape. “Sir, does a thief ever tell you what he’s going to steal?” Kanu replied wryly. His words hung in the air, coming from a man who insists he had no part in planning the jailbreak."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno,Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief,"A month from the election, misinformation is spreading as Republicans try to tie spending on the storm with immigration.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A political row has erupted after Donald Trump claimed Americans hit hard by Hurricane Helene were losing out on emergency relief money because it had been spent on migrants. The White House swiftly rebutted the claims and accused Republicans of spreading ""bold-faced lies"" about funding for the disaster response. On Wednesday US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas had said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which he oversees, was short on cash for the rest of hurricane season. Trump and his allies expressed outrage that the agency had spent over $640m (£487m) on housing migrants. But officials pointed out that this funding, authorised by Congress, was part of an entirely different programme run by Fema unconnected to disaster relief. With less than a month to go before the White House election, Trump and the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are neck and neck in the handful of swing states, such as storm-hit North Carolina and Georgia, that will decide the vote. The deadliest mainland US hurricane since Katrina in 2005, Helene tore through the south-east last week, claiming at least 225 lives and leaving hundreds more missing.  Both Trump and Vice-President Harris have made trips to some of the affected states. Republicans have attempted to link the disaster relief effort to immigration - an issue seen as a strength for Trump - but have spread misinformation about how government money is used.  At an event in Evans, Georgia, on Friday, Trump said, without evidence, that: ""A lot of the money that was supposed to go to Georgia and supposed to go to North Carolina and all of the others is going and has gone already. ""It's been gone for people that came into the country illegally, and nobody has ever seen anything like that. That's a shame."" Fema did receive a budget from Congress - $640m in the last fiscal year - to provide housing to immigrants applying for US citizenship. But the cash came via a federal immigration agency, Customs and Border Protection.  It was spent through Fema's Shelter and Services Program (SSP) and is a separate pot of money to the agency's Disaster Relief Fund of nearly $20bn, which is used to respond to hurricanes and other natural disasters. Fema's disaster relief budget for the year expired at the end of September and the agency is currently running on temporary funding while Congress negotiates a new annual budget. The agency has responded to Trump's claim with a dedicated fact-check page, and a statement from the Department of Homeland Security. “This is false,"" Fema said in a statement. ""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.” So far, more than $45m has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene, said the agency. Fema has also shipped over 11.5m meals and 12.6m litres of water in the aftermath of Helene, said Vice-President Harris on Friday, adding that more than 5,600 federal personnel were on the ground. But Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday that it was ""madness"" for billions of dollars in foreign aid to be sent to Ukraine, instead of to American citizens who had lost everything in the storm. Meanwhile, critics of Trump have pointed out that when he was president back in 2019, $155m was transferred from Fema's operating budget to fund deportations of migrants to Mexico. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8elwrklrk7o,Major US labour union declines to endorse either Harris or Trump,The decision is a blow to the Harris campaign's efforts to woo working-class voters in swing states.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"One of America's most influential labour unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, has declined to issue a US presidential endorsement for the first time since 1996. The union, which boasts some 1.3 million members across the US and Canada, said it had received ""few commitments on top Teamsters issues"" from either Democratic nominee Kamala Harris or Republican nominee Donald Trump. It also claimed that polling of its rank-and-file members found ""no definitive support"" for either candidate, though two of its recent polls indicated lopsided support for Trump. The move is a major blow to the Harris campaign's efforts to win over working-class voters with less than 50 days before election night. An endorsement had the potential to mobilise thousands of Teamsters who live, work and vote in the crucial battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Shortly after the announcement, some Teamsters regional councils representing more than half a million members in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and California, said they would be endorsing Harris. In a statement, the Harris campaign touted its support from ""the overwhelming majority of organised labour"" and noted that many Teamsters locals have gotten behind her candidacy. ""While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice-President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labour for her entire career,"" campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said.  The union's rank-and-file - a coalition of members that includes freight drivers, warehouse workers and airline pilots - has long been considered politically diverse. General President Sean O'Brien has sought to build inroads with Republicans since he took over leadership of the executive board in 2022. He has reached out to more populist figures within the party, such as US senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and JD Vance of Ohio, who is now Trump's running mate. Mr O'Brien also met privately with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in January, shortly before the former president attended a roundtable with the union's board at its headquarters in Washington DC. Following that meeting, Trump said he believed he had a ""good shot"" at receiving the union's endorsement. The board also met with President Joe Biden before he stepped aside as the Democratic nominee, as well as third-party candidates Robert F Kennedy Jr and Cornel West. But the union alarmed Democrats when it made its first financial contribution to their opponents in years, donating $45,000 (£34,000) - the maximum allowed contribution - each to both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in February. Mr O'Brien also became the first Teamsters boss ever to address the Republican National Convention (RNC). Invited to deliver a prime-time address at the event in Milwaukee, the union head praised Trump as ""one tough SOB"" but declined to endorse him. He also later criticised Trump and top campaign surrogate and billionaire businessman Elon Musk over comments in which the two discussed firing workers who threaten to go on strike.  After his decision to speak at the RNC, Mr O'Brien did not receive an invitation from Democrats to address their party convention last month. The party instead invited rank-and-file members to represent the organisation and to speak from the convention stage. Some members of the Teamsters have expressed anger with Mr O'Brien over his right-wing outreach.  Last month, the Teamsters National Black Caucus and six union locals defied national leadership by endorsing Harris on their own and urging members to get behind her. On Monday, Harris met with the Teamsters board in a long-delayed roundtable that lasted an hour and a half. A New York Times report described the sit-down as ""sometimes tense"", but a Teamsters spokesperson disputed this characterisation when asked by the BBC. During their meeting, the Times added, Harris told Teamsters leaders: “I’m confident I’m going to win this. I want your endorsement, but if I don’t get it, I will treat you exactly as if I had gotten your endorsement."" Speaking to reporters after Harris had made her pitch, Mr O'Brien noted that ""there wasn’t a whole lot of difference"" between the answers she and her predecessor, Biden, had provided. Biden has routinely touted himself as ""the most pro-labour president ever"", pointing to policies that have made it easier for US workers to organise and that have prioritised union labour for federal government projects. Last September, he made history as the first US president to walk a picket line, when he joined the United Autoworkers in Michigan in a strike against the Big Three US auto companies: General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. The Biden administration also shored up the Teamsters pension fund to the tune of $36bn, which it says prevented cuts to the retirement incomes of over 600,000 members. Mr O'Brien and other leaders have also acknowledged on several occasions that Biden has been ""great for unions"". But before he dropped out in July, some reports suggested that the Teamsters did not plan to endorse Biden's bid for re-election. Correction: An earlier version of this story was updated to reflect that the Teamsters are the fourth largest, not the largest, US union. On Wednesday, ahead of its announcement that it would not endorse Harris or Trump, the union released polling data for its members. In an electronic poll conducted after the RNC, rank-and-file Teamsters voted 59.6% for the union to endorse Trump compared to 34% for Harris. A separate poll, commissioned in the past week, found Teamsters again backing Trump by a lopsided margin - 58% to 31%. In spite of those results, the union said in a statement that its ""extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump"". The Trump campaign quickly lauded the poll numbers on Wednesday. ""While the Teamsters Executive Board is making no formal endorsement, the hardworking members of the Teamsters have been loud and clear - they want President Trump back in the White House,"" campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce812qvld9do,Trump dominates in rural America - will folksy Walz help Harris?,"The Democratic VP pick hails from Nebraska, a state which could prove crucial in November's vote.",29 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In this closely fought US election, vice-presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz were picked to sway Midwestern and rural voters who might be hesitating over Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. In Nebraska, owing to an electoral quirk, such voters could prove pivotal. As an expert breeder, Wade Bennett can tell you the precise parentage of every one of the 140 head of Charolais cattle he keeps on a small holding on the edge of Nebraska’s rolling Sandhills. Despite being a staunch Republican, he’s less certain, however, of the pedigree of the man once again vying for his vote. Donald Trump, he says, would probably be “kicked out” of his voting shortlist if there were other conservative options available. One of the least-populated states, Nebraska is, like much of rural America, not only deeply Republican but deeply Christian, too. And some here, like Wade, are uncomfortable with what they see as Donald Trump’s personal, moral failings.  But with Kamala Harris and a smattering of small-party candidates the only other options this November, Wade is putting his scruples to one side. “Even as a Christian,” he tells me. “It is what it is.” He’s focusing not on Trump’s character, but on his policies – and he likes the promises he hears to crack down on illegal immigration, cut the cost of living and put more tariffs on trade. Even his slight hesitation, however, is enough to give Democrats hope. The rightward drift of the American countryside over the past 25 years has been remarkable. In 2000, Republicans had a six-point advantage over Democrats among registered rural voters, according to the Pew Research Center. But by 2024, they had established a mammoth 25-point lead. Even though only a fifth of Americans live outside the big towns and cities, the strength of their shift towards Donald Trump was key to his victory against Hillary Clinton in 2016. But for Democrats, the rural vote is still worth fighting for, particularly where even small gains in already tight states just might make the difference. So it’s no coincidence that both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump now have running mates whose white rural roots are being used to make the argument for who is best placed to speak on behalf of this country’s great Midwest. Vice-presidential candidates don't usually have much impact on how people vote, but when Tim Walz and JD Vance meet in a primetime televised debate on Tuesday night, they will be hoping their different backstories and visions resonate with voters still unsure about Harris, a California Democrat, and Trump, a New York real estate developer. Walz, the current governor of Minnesota, was born in small-town Nebraska, and has made much of his background “working cattle, building fence”. His time as a schoolteacher and football coach before politics, and his subsequent record in Minnesota, providing tax credits to families and free school meals, are precisely the kinds of things the Democrats hope will resonate with struggling rural voters. Ohio Senator Vance, on the other hand, is a man who’s also made much of his rural roots, but with a far less optimistic framing. Vance rose to national prominence with his best-selling book, Hillbilly Elegy, the story of his family’s origins in eastern Kentucky, their struggle with poverty, his mother’s fight with addiction and the joblessness and blight of Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up. Where Tim Walz has emphasised individual freedom and what binds Americans, Vance has focused on a ""ruling class"" that he says has failed working families in small communities all over the country.  In writings and in interviews, he has stressed the need for individual responsibility, rather than welfare - although he does not support cutting programmes like Social Security. And he echoes Trump’s vision of protecting American jobs and workers with tariffs and border walls.  I meet 42-year-old Shana Callahan casting for catfish under a setting sun in the Two Rivers Recreation Area, just outside the city of Omaha. The cost of living, once again, is never far from mind. “Everything costs more, everything sucks,” she says. “I drive an F-150 and when Trump was in office, I was paying about 55 bucks for a tank of gas. Right now, it's anywhere between 85 to 109, and, you know, the cost of groceries and everything has just gone through the roof.” There were structural reasons for the depressed oil market during some of Trump’s presidential term, not least the Covid crisis, and prices had begun to climb steeply before he left office. Some economists also say President Joe Biden's 2021 stimulus spending contributed to broader inflation. But economics is a feeling in US elections, not a graph on a page, and Shana has made up her mind. There’s nothing, she tells me, that would convince her to vote for Kamala Harris, especially not Tim Walz’s local backstory and his claims to represent people like her. “For one thing, the man's a goofball,” she says. “I can't respect him. He comes out on the freaking stage like, ‘Oh, go, coach’.” The story of JD Vance being raised by a grandmother because of the opioid crisis - which she knows from the film version of his book - resonates deeply, however. “The beginning of the movie is like, you know, family is always going to back you up. I mean, that's kind of the way it is out here.” “I'm only 42 and I've had like, three friends die of fentanyl.” Shana lives in the one small part of this vast, rural state that may find itself with an outsized impact on November’s election result. Under the US system, each state is allocated a specific number of votes in what’s known as the electoral college. Presidential candidates need to reach 270 votes to win the White House. Unlike most of the rest of America, where all the electoral college votes in each state go to the winner of the popular vote, Nebraska does things differently. Three of its five votes are decided by whoever wins three individual districts. Nebraska is a reliably Republican state but its second district - worth one vote - went to Trump in 2016, to Biden in 2020, and this time round there’s a scenario in which whoever wins it could win the whole election. If Harris wins the Rust Belt swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin and Trump takes the Sun Belt states of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada then the second district would provide the single tie-breaking vote. District two is a microcosm of America, with the heavily Democrat-leaning city of Omaha balanced by the Republican-leaning outskirts and the countryside beyond. In their backyard in the centre of Omaha, Jason Brown and Ruth Huebner-Brown are spraying giant blue dots on plain white lawn signs. “We’re like a little swing state within a state,” Jason tells me. “It could absolutely, I guess you would say, be a history-changing moment. This could really be the ultimate one vote that matters.” In an effort to keep the “blue dot” blue, the Harris-Walz campaign has been massively outspending Trump-Vance here, pouring millions into TV advertising. Ruth tells me she believes it’s having an effect on the doorsteps. “When they talk about Walz he's very relatable. He's, you know, one of us. And, you know, they just trust him.” “And I think a lot of people are very tired of the divisiveness and the bitterness and he's, he's anything but that.” There’s plenty of divisiveness in Nebraska. Even here, deep in the American countryside, you can hear the unsubstantiated assertions that large numbers of immigrants are unlawfully claiming Social Security or engaging in ballot fraud. One Republican voter admits his belief in such claims is based not on fact, but on what he’s heard, with echoes of JD Vance’s similar justification for his promotion, without evidence, of the allegation that Haitian migrants are eating pets in Ohio. A soybean farmer tells me that Kamala Harris is a ""DEI hire""; another says it is white people who are being discriminated against in today’s America. Yet, on the Democratic side, there are signs of groupthink too - the bafflement over the choices of their opponents and a readiness to see all Republican voters as motivated by the narrow politics of prejudice. But there’s something else unique about Nebraska’s electoral system. Its state legislature is nonpartisan, meaning it does not recognise the party affiliations of its elected members nor organise them around formal party voting blocs. In the city of Hastings, Michelle Smith is out canvassing for a seat in that local legislature. She’s a Democrat fighting for votes in a very red district, but, she says, the system encourages compromise. “My own father is one of those people who’s going to vote for Donald Trump, and I understand it,” she tells me. “I'm a business owner. I paid less taxes when Donald Trump was president. Our prices were lower at the grocery store.” How does she campaign?  ""I bring it down to the local issues. I'm not a national candidate. I'm a local candidate, and I'm running to make things better here in Nebraska.” For now, Nebraska is very much in the national spotlight. There’s been a last-minute attempt by the Republican Party not to leave anything to chance, with several lawmakers pushing for a move to make the state a winner-takes-all system. Barring the completely unexpected, that would mean all the state’s electoral college votes go to Donald Trump. It foundered, though, on the opposition of a few local Republican senators, who refused to bow to the pressure this close to an election, placing what they saw as the interests of the state - given the rare bit of political leverage the system provides - over that of national partisan politics. Even Lindsey Graham, the powerful Republican senator, flew in to meet with the holdouts, but to no avail. “It was interesting,” he’s reported to have said back in Washington. “They have a different system. Everybody’s like a mini-governor.” Whether or not Nebraska plays an outsized role in November’s deeply divided contest, it may offer something of an alternative to it.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9pjy9znlvo,Blunt and bold - Kenya's 'truth speaker' faces the sack,"Kenya's deputy president, who faces impeachment, branded himself as ""the truthful man"".",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kenya's embattled Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua, calls himself the “truthful man”, attributing his remarkable rise to the fact that he speaks truth to power. But as he faces impeachment proceedings, he says these troubles are also a result of his outspoken nature. Before he was elected MP in 2017, little was known about the man who would, in five short years, rise to become Kenya’s second-in-command. Not many people outside Gachagua's central Kenya constituency had heard of him or his style of politics. Gachagua captured the limelight in the run-up to the 2022 elections, when he vehemently opposed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s choice of preferred successor. Kenyatta was campaigning heavily for former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.  But Gachagua allied himself with William Ruto, Kenyatta’s then deputy, who was angling for the presidency that his boss did not want to bequeath to him. At political rallies and in media circles, Gachagua railed against Kenyatta, often in words that other politicians would find cringeworthy. “Don’t kill me the way your father killed JM Kariuki,” he said at a rally in July 2022, referring to an MP who was killed in 1975 during the administration of Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's first president and the father of Uhuru Kenyatta.  To this day, no one has been found guilty of Kariuki's death. Before he became Kenya's deputy president, police raided Gachagua's home and arrested him in relation to a corruption and money-laundering case. The charges were dropped after he and Ruto took power following the 2022 election.  He had helped Ruto win by marshalling support in Mount Kenya - the biggest voting bloc in the country. Both Gachagua and Kenyatta come from there. Kenyatta had tried to rally Mount Kenya's voters to throw their weight behind Odinga, but he failed.  Long before Kenyatta became president in 2013, Gachagua had worked closely with  him, including as his personal assistant for five years. But after teaming up with Ruto, Gachagua went from being Kenyatta's “confidant” to one of his harshest critics. However, since falling out with his current boss, Gachagua has apologised to Kenyatta, saying it was “foolish” of him to have “fought my own brother"". This humility is in sharp contrast to his rhetoric as Ruto's running-mate - analyst Javas Bigamo had even described Gachagua as a “feared political bulldog that Ruto needed to be able to counter President Kenyatta in the central region”. Gachagua was praised as an excellent mobiliser, who had the ear of ordinary people on the ground. Yet he was probably not the person many expected to take the deputy position, given that Gachagua had only being a politician for five years and was up against more seasoned candidates. Ruto explained he had chosen Gachagua because ""he is one of those leaders who are passionate about ordinary people"". Politics expert Bobby Mkangi previously told the BBC that Gachagua’s ability to negotiate his way to the top “considering other names that were fronted and were known nationally"" was ""quite something”. But just two years after ascending to power, that ability seems to have fizzled out – leaving Gachagua butting heads with the president and in a position where many legislators are pushing for his removal. He stands accused of corruption, money-laundering, gross misconduct, insubordination and bullying public officers and six other acts of wrongdoing. As the motion was being tabled in parliament on Tuesday, the MP introducing the motion, Mwengi Mutuse, said that 291 out of 349 MPs had signed the document pushing for Gachagua's removal. The signatures of two-thirds - or 233 - of all MPs are required to impeach him. Mkangi now says the deputy president has been “unable to consolidate the support of his base and the politicians around him”.  Gachagua has always been accused of being brash and aggressive – it was one of the reasons some argued against his selection to the running mate position prior to the 2022 election. But in recent months, this criticism has increased. He denies this assessment of his character, along with assertions that he alienates his fellow politicians. He says all he does is “speak the truth”, which he insists has made him unpopular within certain political factions. “I will not compromise my principles,” he said over the weekend as calls for his impeachment came to a crescendo. Gachagua has often identified himself as a child of the Mau Mau freedom fighters, who battled British colonial rule. He was born in 1965 to parents who he has said were well known for their involvement in the struggle for freedom. His father built and serviced guns and his mother was a courier of ammunition and food for the fighters, Gachagua said. His lineage has painted him as a champion of people in central Kenya, many of whom are descendants of independence struggle icons, but still continue to fight for economic freedom. A popular catchphrase associated with the deputy president is “don’t touch the mountain”, a reference to his support base in the Mount Kenya region. However, he has also been accused of promoting tribalism rather than being a unifying figure. But Gachagua has defended himself, insisting that speaking for the central Kenya region is not the same as antagonising other communities. Before joining politics, Gachagua had had a long career.  After completing university, he began working as a public administrator in government, and as a district officer in different locations across the country. The district administrators of that time, during Daniel arap Moi’s presidency, were known for their high-handedness. It is an accusation that has stuck with him, including in present circumstances. He worked as Kenyatta's personal assistant between 2001 and 2006 – at a time when Kenyatta was a minister, presidential candidate and later the leader of the opposition. Gachagua is a wealthy politician, having built a fortune in business over the years. He is married to a pastor, Dorcas, and they have two adult sons. In 2017, he vied for the Mathira constituency seat, winning the position that had earlier been held by his elder brother, Nderitu Gachagua. It is at this time that Gachagua's fiery character and political abilities started attracting attention. Yet his public utterances, before and since he became deputy president, have at times been seen as blunders or straight-up disgraceful comments. He said last year that government was like a shareholding company, with those that voted for the current administration being more deserving of government appointments and contracts. Senator Danson Mungatana last week said Gachagua’s words have “marginalised sections of Kenyans, created and continue to heighten ethnic tensions”. Gachagua has often defended himself, but recently he acknowledged that in the end, it may be the very same thing that catapulted him to the top that will lead to his downfall: his way with words.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ekg70wejdo,Democrats usually win these states. Why Trump's visiting them anyway,Control of the US House - and the agenda of the next president - could come down to certain swing districts,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Fewer than 50 days before the US election, with House seats and the future of his presidential agenda hanging in the balance, Republican Donald Trump held a rally in a state he's likely to lose. “When I told some people in Washington, yeah, I'm going up to New York, we're doing a campaign speech, they said, ‘What do you mean New York?’ Nobody can win. Republicans can't win,’” Trump regaled a crowd at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island earlier this month. The rally was only a short train ride from the liberal bastion of New York City, but the atmosphere was indistinguishable from his rallies in more conservative states. The arena’s parking lot was a Trumpian tailgate party; vendors sold merchandise with the slogan “I’m voting for the felon,"" and a Trump impersonator posed for photos. “I said, I can win New York, and we can win New York,” Trump declared. Maureen Liantonio, a 55-year-old from Long Island, showed up to support him. Rather than wearing the usual red-white-and-blue to the rally, she wore a bright shirt featuring Trump wearing Barbie-pink shades and blowing bubble gum. “I’m doing it all Republican,” she said. ""The whole down ballot, Republican.” Trump might not take New York in the Electoral College, but that night in Uniondale before thousands, he was correct – Republicans can win. In New York, Republicans and Democrats are at war over a handful of congressional districts on Long Island, and in the Hudson Valley and central region as they fight to control the House of Representatives - in addition to the White House. Part of Trump's mission in Democratic states like New York, which he is unlikely to win, is to fight for Republican candidates to win those districts. A handful of moderate districts in partisan states could tip the balance of power in the House. Republicans, currently the House majority, are challenging Democratic representatives in blue-leaning regions in Washington state and Maine. Meanwhile Democrats are fighting to keep their centrist lawmakers in more conservative states like Alaska and Ohio. Winning House seats in up-for grabs districts like Uniondale's is vital for Trump and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris: House control helps determine whether the next president's agenda faces supportive, same-party lawmakers - or an unyielding wall of partisan opposition. While Trump might not win New York this November, the Republican Party has had surprising success in House contests there in recent years. Republican Anthony D’Esposito, representative for the now-hotly contested 4th district where the rally was held, warmed up the crowd for Trump, receiving a hearty welcome. “Long Island is a battleground island!” he roared. He flipped the district from Democratic control in 2022, even though President Joe Biden had dominated there two years prior. It's now a district Democrats want back. Hammering warnings about crime, immigration and inflation helped the Republican Party capture key New York suburban districts - and control of the House - in 2022. Trump and down-ballot Republicans are hoping to replicate this success nationwide. “We're not a border state, but immigration is huge,” said Randie Lucano, 64, a small business owner living in the 4th district. “Economy is huge. Housing, the next generation. What can they afford?” Ms Lucano said she is an independent and considered voting for Robert F Kennedy Jr before he dropped out. Now, she said, she will vote Republican because she believes Trump will stem immigration and control the cost of living. Nationally, likely voters who say the economy is a major issue in this election support Trump over Harris, 53% to 47%, a mid-September poll by CBS News/YouGov found. The poll also indicated that voters who view immigrants negatively support Trump; 73% of registered voters who support Trump said immigrants made the country worse, compared to just 13% of Trump voters who believe the opposite. Long Island voter, Celine Kaur, 48, feels strongly about migrants. “We have terrorists that could be coming over,” she said, echoing Mr Trump’s rhetoric. “It's terrible. It's absolutely terrible.” Ms Kaur said her parents immigrated legally from Guyana in the 1980s, but that new migrants drain resources. “I can't even get any kind of help, but they're coming yesterday, and they're getting so much help,” she said. While Trump provided plenty of red meat for his base at the rally, there’s a chance he could turn off those key moderate voters. “The problem for the Republicans who are running in moderate, suburban swing districts is that these voters tend to shy away from extremism of any stripe, both in terms of tone and substance,” said Lawrence Levy, a suburban politics expert at Hofstra University. “The danger for the Republican Party down ballot is that his tone, and his language on race, and on crime…it really hurts his ability to connect with all but his most faithful supporters.” And this is not 2022, when Democrats didn't have a presidential race to boost turnout and faced an unfavourable round of redistricting. Two years ago, “we had the wind at our faces. Now I think we’ve got the wind at our backs,” said Jay Jacobs, New York State Democratic Party chair.  Democrats have a new motivating factor in Ms Harris, whose historic campaign  could encourage less frequent voters. She also is running on abortion rights, which has been an Achilles heel for Trump. Christine Y., a 4th district resident, said she did not want to vote for Trump because of “his attitude"", though much of her family likes him. “There’s no love-thy-neighbor,” said Christine, who didn't want her last name used for privacy reasons. As a Korean American, she was uncomfortable with Trump’s rhetoric on immigration and crime. But it was abortion that animated her. “Personally, I'm pro-life, but I'm not going to tell other people what to do,” she said. “So I guess I’m pro-choice. It’s between them and God. It's their choice.” Christine hasn't always voted, but said that this year she probably will pick Harris. And maybe her local Democrats, too."

It is the only part of the former County of Avon not to be part of the combined authority. North Somerset Council leader Mike Bell said: ""This is an expression of interest. It is no more than that. It isn’t a deal, it isn’t a set of proposals, and there’s clearly a lot of work to be done."" It follows a letter from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner to council leaders across the country, urging them to join combined authorities. Ms Rayner's letter was sent as part of ""the most ambitious programme of devolution this country has ever seen"". But Mr Bell said joining WECA was ""not the only option on the table"" at a meeting on 17 September, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service. ""This is not signing on the dotted line but it is saying we are interested, we are up for the conversation with government about how to access a devolution deal, which is all about trying to secure long-term benefits for residents, businesses, and others in North Somerset,"" he added. Mr Bell also explained there ""are lots of positives and some negatives"" regarding potential devolution deals. The four unitary authorities of North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, and South Gloucestershire used to form one county council - the County of Avon.  The controversial merger was created in 1974, creating a “greater Bristol” by breaking off southern parts of Gloucestershire and northern parts of Somerset.  It was dissolved in 1996, creating four unitary authorities, before three of them reconvened under WECA in 2017, with North Somerset voting against joining. If it joins WECA by its next elections in May 2025, North Somerset residents will be able to vote for the West of England Metro Mayor.  Dan Norris became Labour's metro mayor for the area in 2021 but was also elected MP for North East Somerset and Hanham at this year’s general election.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4l4j4mxkxo,Teenagers call for voting at 16 in NI,Around 150 young people have gathered at Queen's University in Belfast to begin a campaign to vote at 16.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"""If Scotland and Wales have votes at 16, why doesn't Northern Ireland?"" Jake, 17, from County Down follows politics closely but - as he puts it - he has ""no say"" on polling day. He wants that to change, and he is not alone. About150 young people have gathered at Queen's University in Belfast to begin a campaign calling to be allowed to vote at age 16. Their peers in Scotland and Wales already have that right in elections to councils and national parliaments. In Scotland, 16-year-olds were allowed to vote in the independence referendum in 2014. They have since been allowed to vote in elections for local government and the Scottish parliament. In Wales, 16 and 17 year olds were able to vote in elections for the Welsh Parliament for the first time in 2021. The event at Queen's to launch the 'Votes at 16' campaign was organised by the Politics in Action organisation. Lleucu Haf Wiliam from Wales was at the event to tell local young people about her experience of voting at 16. She said she voted with issues in her area in mind and ""things that are really affecting me in my daily life. ""Stuff like the environment, I see it every day. I live on Barry Island so I can see how much climate change affects where I live."" Anna McFadyen from Scotland was able to vote for the first time in a council election when she was 16. ""I had a modern studies exam that day, which is kind of politics, so it was really exciting as I got to back to my own primary school and cast my first vote. ""I think it's really important for young people to have their voices heard. ""I always felt because I had the vote at 16 I could be more engaged in politics."" For 17 year old Oliver from County Antrim, he wants politicians to improve mental health services for young people. ""We know that if we can bring votes to 16 year olds and 17 year olds, they'll have to listen to us then. ""Young people's needs for mental health in particular, if they're met at an early stage you can have intervention and ease the stress in the system in the long term."" Jake said that he was frustrated at not being able to vote in the recent general election. ""I wish I had a say in that, I wish I could vote especially within my local constituency,"" he said. ""I could go out, help with campaigns, work with local MLAs, potentially contact councillors but when it came to the day of voting I had no say."" 16 year old Matt from Belfast also wants to be able to vote. They said it was ""a bit condescending"" for older people to assume that younger people were not interested in politics. ""It's harmful and it's frustrating for me as I want to get involved in politics and I know so many other people that do. ""And it's really putting a barrier between me and me interacting with Stormont."" Maddison, 17, from Enniskillen, told BBC News NI that people should not assume young people would just vote the same way as their parents. ""Often teenagers are seen as doing the opposite of their parents anyway, so I don't know why that would be any different in politics. ""It's about improving democracy, it's not about whether it will benefit a particular political party,"" she said. Maddison said she would vote for a candidate based on their policies on ""education, the environmental crisis as well, special educational needs. ""A lot of these arguments that are being made against 16 year olds were made against 18 year olds before the voting age was lowered or against women before they were given the vote,"" she continued. The overall UK voting age was last lowered in 1969 - from 21 to 18. Labour's manifesto had pledged to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 in UK general elections but it was not included in the King's Speech in July which sets out the government's legislative programme. But according to Paul Smyth, from Politics in Action, MLAs in the Northern Ireland assembly could take steps to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote in council and assembly elections. In 2012 members of the Assembly backed a motion calling for the voting age to be reduced to 16, but no action resulted. ""Our parties haven't actually done anything to take the issue forward,"" he said. ""So, we're calling on the executive to ask Westminster for the powers to be devolved so they can legislate like they did in Scotland and Wales to let 16 and 17 year olds vote."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e957e472qo,Tory chairman: 'Defeat in the East was painful',Richard Fuller says Conservatives must work to regain trust after losing heavily in the East in July.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The interim chairman of the Conservative Party says July's election defeat in the East of England has been ""very painful"". Richard Fuller, the MP for North Bedfordshire, said voters saw the Tories as divided and self serving. But he claimed there were already signs of “buyers' remorse” as voters had second thoughts about Labour - and if the Conservative could show they had listened and made changes, the party could be ""back in the frame at the next election"". Fuller was speaking as Conservatives prepared for their annual conference, meeting for the first time since their defeat in July, which saw them lose 35 seats across the East of England. The Conservative share of the vote fell by more in the East of England than any other region.  Across the UK it was down 19.9%. In the East it fell by 26.5%. But the interim chairman doesn’t make any excuses. ""It was very much the fault of the parliamentary party,"" he says. ""The public said we didn’t look like we were united, we looked like we were self-serving and that affected our delivery of change on some of the important things that people voted for in 2019.  ""They saw the election as an opportunity to see a change from that."" He described the result as ""very painful"". He said he had spent the summer having ""hard"" conversations with defeated candidates. He knows what it’s like to lose an election, having lost his former seat of Bedford in 2017. But Fuller also believes that things may not be as bad for his party as the figures suggest. ""If you look at the figures, Labour got a very large majority on quite a paltry vote,"" he says. ""I think we can already see that there’s some buyers' remorse from people who wanted to get rid of the Conservative Party and now see what they’re getting with the Labour Party, particularly people who voted Reform, who can see that if you divide your vote you end up with very perverse outcomes. ""But the primary responsibility is now on the Conservatives.  ""We need to demonstrate that we have listened to the public and that we’re making real changes so we can be in the frame at the next general election and people can say 'you’ve earned our trust again'"". That process of rebuilding will begin at this weekend’s party conference in Birmingham, where a large part of the timetable will be given over to the four leadership candidates who will make their pitch to members. As party chairman, Fuller is not publicly supporting any candidate. But he thinks the key to winning again is to ""re-base ourselves on our core Conservative principles"". The big debate within the party is what to do about Reform UK, which won five seats across the country, three of them in the East of England, and taking thousands of votes from the Conservatives. ""We gave space for Reform to grow and that’s what we need to address,"" says Fuller, admitting that the Tories' stance on immigration and taxation were big factors. ""People who normally vote Conservative felt Reform were offering what they wanted better than we were,"" he says. ""The solution isn’t veering to the right or the left, it largely comes down to people wanting to know that they are putting their trust in a competent government with 'small c' principles."" As party chairman it will be his job to open the conference on Sunday, the first time he has spoken at a party conference in 40 years.   He says he won’t be trying to gee up the membership, instead he wants to tell them that he has listened to their concerns, in particularly over the issue of candidate selection.  Many associations were angry at the way candidates were forced on them at the last election. ""Most people will not be coming to hear me,"" he says, adding: ""What they’ll be interested in at this conference is the vision of our four leadership candidates."" He is proud that the party has already won seven council by-elections since the general election. He says: ""It shows that when Conservatives work hard in their local areas we win back people's trust.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr5j1q8wlno,Muted mics and politeness - six takeaways from VP debate,"Vance and Walz focused their attacks on Harris and Trump's plans on the economy, immigration and abortion.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"On Tuesday night, JD Vance and Tim Walz launched attacks on their presidential opponents, sparring over international conflict, the US economy, immigration and abortion rights. Despite those heated moments - and at least one muted microphone - it was perhaps the most civil debate of the 2024 election campaign. There were even points of common ground between the two men. Here are some of the most memorable parts of the first and only scheduled TV showdown between the running mates of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.  Abortion rights, a top issue in the 2024 election, sparked one of the longest and most heated exchanges of the night. It's an issue Democrats have used to galvanize voters, regularly framing Trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of his role in appointing a conservative majority to the Supreme Court. The court later overturned Roe v Wade, the ruling that had protected abortion rights in the US for decades.  Walz cited the stories of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, two women from Georgia whose deaths were connected to abortion restrictions in their home state. Vance, meanwhile, said his opinion on the issue had changed. He previously supported some type of national restrictions on abortion, but said his position shifted when he saw the majority of Ohio voters supported access to abortion.  He also said his party had to do ""so much better... at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us"". Walz had his best moment of the night near the end when the focus shifted to the 6 January 2021 riot and election denialism. In a tense exchange, Vance refused to say that Trump had lost the 2020 election, prompting some disbelief from Walz who called it a ""damning non-answer"". The moderators also raised Vance's previous comments that he would not have certified the 2020 election results if he had been vice-president at the time. Vance maintained his support for Trump, saying the former president had asked demonstrators on the day of the Capitol riot to protest peacefully. He added that Walz would have his best wishes if the Democrats win the 5 November election, but said there were legitimate questions to raise about voting fraud and security.  Walz said he and his opponent were ""miles apart"" on the issue of 6 January and election integrity. Walz and Vance took the stage just hours after Iran launched a missile attack on Israel - whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed retaliation. The ongoing tensions in the Middle East formed the basis of the first question. Appearing nervous, Walz stumbled as he repeated Harris's promise of iron-clad support for Israel.  Vance, meanwhile, reiterated one of Trump's main talking points: that no new world conflicts broke out during the former president's time in office.  Neither man would say if they approved of a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Immigration was a key topic throughout the 90-minute head-to-head. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, frequently returned to the issue of the US southern border and immigration - viewed by many voters as a weakness for his opponents.  Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, countered that Trump helped torpedo bipartisan legislation that would have enacted some of the toughest immigration policy in US history.  The discussion ultimately turned tense when Vance was asked about false claims he made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. Vance and Trump previously shared conspiracy theories that illegal migrants were eating pets in the small city. When a CBS News moderator tried to correct Vance, the Ohio senator spoke over the hosts - who went on to mute his microphone.  Just before the debate, a claim of Walz's collapsed under scrutiny - that he had been in Hong Kong when the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre occurred in Beijing.  ""I'm a knucklehead at times,"" Walz said when asked about it on Tuesday night.  The Minnesota governor clarified that he had misspoken, saying he was influenced by the events because he had arrived in China that summer.  Vance also was asked to answer for some past comments, including prior attacks on his running mate, Trump, who he once called ""America's Hitler"".  The Ohio senator said he, like many people, has made mistakes in the past. ""I was wrong about Donald Trump,"" he said.  The tone was in stark contrast to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump’s first encounter last month, when insults flew and interruptions were frequent. Starting off the night with a handshake, both Vance and Walz proceeded to address each other politely and with civility. The two even exchanged smiles periodically, agreeing from time to time with what their rival had said.  They did direct some fire at the top of the ticket, however - Vance taking aim at Harris and Walz at Trump.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd1q9q9gl9o,Biden condemns misinformation about hurricane,BBC Verify looks into claims made about the US government's response to Hurricane Helene.,5 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"President Joe Biden has said the ""irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies"" about the government's hurricane response is ""undermining confidence"" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.  Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.  Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.  Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.  At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on  migrants who crossed illegally into the US. “Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants,"" Trump said in Michigan last week. This claim is false.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year -  which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters. Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody. This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims. So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating. Fema, which has now set up a fact-checking page on its website, called Trump's claim ""false"" saying, ""no money is being diverted from disaster response needs"". In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season. But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”. Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants. “They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday. It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed. This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema. The $750 is what people can get as an upfront payment to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies. Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment. This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay. So far, Fema has said that more than $210m has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs. When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected. “He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September. But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.” “He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added. Trump said at the Butler rally that “Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina -  no helicopters, no rescue - it’s just - what’s happened there is very bad.” This is false. By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already posted on X that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”. The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.  The North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina. The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwl8807w7o,Council of Nations tackles challenge of UK power-sharing,"The prime minister, the devolved leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and England's mayors are meeting in Edinburgh.",3 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Sir Keir Starmer has chaired the first-ever meeting of a new Council of the Nations and Regions in Edinburgh. It brought the prime minister together with the leaders of the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as England’s mayors. Power sharing between the different governments of the UK was bound to cause a degree of tension. Anyone who thought that would always be a creative and constructive force was probably idealistic, if not naive. There have been some spectacular rows between the devolved administrations and UK departments over the years. Fights about funding are probably the most common and sometimes ministers in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast have teamed up to make joint representations to the Treasury in London. At other times, the struggles have been about where power lies and whether or not that should change. Relations between the Scottish and UK governments have been particularly fraught at times - not least during the protracted debates over Brexit and the possibility of a second independence referendum. The new Labour government under Starmer promised a reset to which the SNP first minister, John Swinney said he would also commit. The early signs have been positive. Yes, there’s been disagreement over the UK decision to stop funding a universal winter fuel payment for the elderly. But there has also been serious discussion about how the governments can work together to secure a future for the huge Grangemouth industrial site. Only this week, the Scottish finance secretary Shona Robison, reported to a Holyrood committee meaningful change in her pre-budget discussions with Treasury ministers. The first meeting of the Council of the Nations and Regions is a further effort to improve the workings of government. Speaking as it opened on Friday morning, the prime minister said the council was a ""statement of intent on my behalf, and on behalf of the government, about the way in which we want to work with all of you. ""I think that is as important as the substance of what we discuss, is how we collaborate, how we work together. ""Because the UK is really strong, we've got so much to offer, particularly when it comes to growth and investment, but we are a bit complicated."" Despite her move to become the ""envoy to the nations and regions"", former Downing Street chief of staff Sue Gray will not appear at the meeting. Ms Gray took on the role of Sir Keir's aide when Labour swept to power in July, but she has since been replaced by Morgan McSweeney, who led the party's election campaign. Former civil servant Ms Gray, who boasts decade of experience behind the scenes, cited ""intense commentary about my position"" that risked becoming a ""distraction"" when she stood down. Some SNP politicians have complained that Scottish cities like Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen do not have their own seats at the table. Labour sources say that’s because the SNP has not devolved powers beyond Holyrood to create regional leadership within Scotland. The new Council is not quite the “powerful, legally-mandated” body that Gordon Brown envisaged in his commission on the UK’s future. It’s not clear what decision-making power it will actually have. However, Downing Street seems determined to avoid giving the impression that this new body will simply be a talking shop. The inaugural meeting is discussing major investments in renewable energy technology across the UK ahead of a further investment conference on Monday. These get togethers are expected to be held twice a year. Ahead of the first full gathering, devolved leaders met the PM individually and as a group - the so-called “quad”. Scotland's first minister, John Swinney, said he had pushed Starmer for more public investment when the UK government unveils its budget at the end of the month. Swinney said it had been a ""helpful conversation with the prime minister about the important issues that affect Scotland."" He added: ""This has been a welcome opportunity to raise significant issues that affect the prospects of Scotland, and central to that is the outcome of the budget, where we need to see investment in our public services and in our infrastructure to stimulate the growth that all of us want to see delivered within the economy."" The first minister also pushed Starmer on a carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) facility in Aberdeenshire, which has been overlooked by the UK government for funding. If relations between the Holyrood and Westminster governments are better now than they were before the UK general election, it’s worth pointing out that the baseline was an all time low. As Scottish Secretary, Conservative MP Alister Jack was quite happy to be seen as a muscular unionist, checking the nationalism of the SNP. He used the UK internal market act, brought in following Brexit, to block the introduction of a Scottish bottle deposit scheme. UK ministers also used their reserved powers to stop gender recognition reforms in Scotland and were backed up by the courts. SNP ministers saw this as outrageous interference in the exercise of devolved power. From Mr Jack’s perspective he was confronting outrageous overreach by the devolved administration. In a separate dispute, UK lawyers argued successfully in court that Holyrood could not hold another independence referendum without their approval. These clashes poisoned relations between the Scottish and UK governments. They could not have gotten much worse. Not that there was never any cooperation between Conservative governments at Westminster and the SNP at Holyrood. They managed to agree to work together on freeports and struck a deal to expand Holyrood’s tax and welfare powers after the 2014 independence referendum. Relations between governments were probably best when the parties of power in Edinburgh and London were the same. For the first eight years of devolution that was Labour. As first minister, Jack McConnell was able to secure a role for Holyrood in overseas aid which is a UK responsibility. There was also a “fresh talent” deal to allow overseas students graduating in Scotland visa extensions. But even in those years there were disputes. When UK authorities carried out “dawn raids” to remove “failed asylum seekers” including children that had become settled in Scotland, the devolved government objected. They argued that while immigration, asylum and border controls were UK responsibilities, this particular policy clashed with devolved powers to protect the welfare of children. There was an understanding for a time, then a change of UK ministers reasserted Westminster control. The switch in Holyrood power from Labour to the SNP in 2007 soon signalled that the level of friction could become a lot greater. The SNP first minister, Alex Salmond, was outraged when Labour prime minister, Tony Blair struck a prisoner transfer deal in the Libyan desert with Colonel Gaddafi. This was at a time when the only Libyan prisoner in Scotland was the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Scottish ministers had not been consulted. As it turned out, the Salmond administration refused to allow transfer under this agreement but instead released al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds because he had cancer. These disputes are now part of Holyrood history but they underline that there has been and probably always will be tension in intergovernmental relations. Starmer and Swinney seem committed to a more constructive relationship. Maintaining that all the way to the next Holyrood elections in 2026 would be a much bigger ask of one another."

Secret Service acting Director Ronald Rowe said the interim report suggested “complacency” by some of its agents. He said the use of different radio frequencies by police and Secret Service meant Trump’s protection team were unaware a suspicious person had been identified at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. The report also highlighted the failure to secure the building that the shooter fired from. The attack on 13 July led to the resignation of the Secret Service’s last director. ""Secret Service did not give clear guidance or direction to local law enforcement partners,"" Mr Rowe said on Friday. A gunman fired eight shots at Trump from the roof of a building. The Republican White House candidate's ear was grazed by a bullet, while one rally attendee was killed and two others were injured before a Secret Service sniper shot the suspect dead. Friday's internal findings suggest Trump's security detail was not aware that state and local law enforcement were intensely pursuing a suspicious person, who turned out to be the gunman. Had they been aware, agents might have moved Trump to another location during the search, according to the report. Law enforcement also communicated vital information outside the Secret Service’s radio frequencies. The suspect was able to get on to a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where the former president was speaking. Mr Rowe described a ""lack of follow-through"" on access control to the building and the rooftop. He added that line-of-sight issues involving the building were acknowledged, but were not mitigated or escalated to supervisors. The acting director said the Secret Service cannot ""defer our responsibilities to others"" as the agency moves to an accountability phase of its review. “This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service,"" Mr Rowe said. ""It’s important that we hold ourselves accountable for the failures of July 13, and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again."" The agency says disciplinary actions will be taken for agents involved. The acting director spoke of a heightened threat environment following the second apparent assassination attempt involving Trump on Sunday in Florida. He said the agency needed a ""paradigm shift"". Also on Friday, the US House of Representatives voted unanimously to bolster Secret Service protection for presidential and vice- presidential candidates. The bill will need to pass the Senate."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pdlg4dlno,"Trump 'resorted to crimes' to overturn 2020 election, prosecutors say",A new filing presents the clearest view yet of how prosecutors would present their case against the former president at trial.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump ""resorted to crimes"" while trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and should not escape charges, prosecutors say. A new court filing challenges Trump's claim that he should avoid a trial thanks to a recent landmark US Supreme Court ruling. This said American presidents should be immune from prosecution when acting in an ""official"" capacity. Trump was president when the alleged offences were committed - but prosecutors say he was acting in a ""private"" capacity, not an official one. In response, Trump has repeated false claims that the 2020 vote was ""rigged"" and suggested the timing of the filing's release was designed to hurt his 2024 campaign. In an interview with NewsNation, he also criticised Special Counsel Jack Smith, the lead prosecutor in the election interference probe who submitted the filing. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan released the document - filed by Mr Smith last week - with redactions on Wednesday. This is one of four criminal cases Trump has faced since being voted out in 2020 - another of which led to a historic conviction in New York. He is accused of seeking to illegally block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, but denies wrongdoing. The new 165-page document presents the clearest view yet of how Mr Smith's team would pursue their case, having tweaked the wording of their charges after the Supreme Court's intervention. It gives details of Trump's alleged scheme, including his actions when his supporters rioted at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021. It also outlines the efforts of Mike Pence, the vice-president at the time, to talk him down.  The issue remains prominent in US politics almost four years later, ahead of the 2024 election in November, which will be contested by Trump and Kamala Harris. It came up in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate, during which JD Vance refused to answer whether Trump, his running mate for 2024, lost in 2020. The court filing may represent Mr Smith's last chance to set out his case against Trump.  The case has been frequently delayed since charges were filed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) more than a year ago.  Chutkan has given Trump's team until 7 November - two days after the presidential election - to respond to the latest filing. The filing means he will not face trial before November's election - and he could seek to have the case dropped if he wins. Trump's lawyers fought to keep the latest filing sealed. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung has called it ""falsehood-ridden"" and ""unconstitutional"". In the newly released document, Mr Smith and his team try to navigate the summer Supreme Court ruling - which dented their case - by narrowing their scope. The Supreme Court ruling did not apply immunity to unofficial acts. The prosecutors argue that although Trump was still in office when attempting to overturn the 2020 vote, his attempts related to his campaign and his life as a private citizen. They call it a ""private criminal effort"". The court should therefore ""determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as he would any other citizen,"" the filing says. The filing lays out several instances in which Pence expressed doubt about his boss's voter fraud claims and tried to persuade him to accept he lost the election. In the court document, prosecutors say Trump was not upset when he learned his vice-president had been rushed to a secure location as rioters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021. ""So what?"" he allegedly said, when informed of the scenes. Pence would later go public about his falling out with Trump in the wake of the storming of Congress, when some rioters shouted ""hang Mike Pence"" because the vice-president refused to obstruct the certification of election results. The filing also alleges that Trump always planned to declare victory no matter the result, and laid the groundwork for this long before election day. It also accuses him of knowingly spreading false claims about the vote that he himself deemed ""crazy"". Mr Smith also provides several new details about the Trump campaign's alleged role in sowing chaos in battleground states, where a large number of mail-in ballots were being counted in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the Democratic stronghold of Detroit, Michigan, when a large batch of ballots seemed to be in favour of Biden, a Trump campaign operative allegedly told his colleague to ""find a reason"" that something was wrong with the ballots to give him ""options to file litigation"". The filing also claims that Trump and his allies, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, sought to ""exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol"" on 6 January 2021 to delay the election certification. They allegedly did this by calling senators and leaving voicemails that asked them to object to the state electors.  Trump said on Wednesday that the case would end with his ""complete victory"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevyzkdx73yo,"Immigration, Project 2025, taxes - VP debate claims fact-checked",BBC Verify examined the claims Walz and Vance made during the first and only vice-presidential debate.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance sparred on stage during their one and only debate of the 2024 US election campaign.  Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator representing Ohio, traded claims on key election issues including immigration, foreign policy and reproductive rights.  Here are some claims from each candidate which the BBC Verify team fact-checked. CLAIM: Vance: “We’ve got 20-25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.” VERDICT: These numbers are much higher than estimates for the number of illegal immigrants in the US.  Vance made this claim while criticising the border policies of President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Vance claims. A report published by the Office of Homeland Security earlier this year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million. Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute came up with similar estimates for 2022 and 2021.  And the Center for Immigration Studies estimated there were approximately 12 million illegal immigrants in May 2023. CLAIM: Walz: “Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.” VERDICT: This is false - Project 2025 does not mention a registry of pregnancies. There is no evidence that Donald Trump is planning to introduce one. Here, Walz was trying to link Vance and Trump to Project 2025 - a wish list of ultra-conservative policy proposals by the Heritage Foundation think tank.  Walz might be referring to a section in the document which states that a future Trump administration “should use every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders”. Project 2025 suggests that US health authorities and states should collect such data, but it does not refer to any new federal agency to register pregnancies. Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 - though dozens of former Trump administration officials have contributed to the think tank's proposals.  CLAIM: Vance: “Iran has received over $100bn in unfrozen assets by the Harris administration."" VERDICT: This is false. There is no evidence that the Biden-Harris administration has unfrozen over $100bn (£75bn). Speaking just hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Israel, Vance criticised the government over Iran. Iran has had billions of dollars frozen in foreign banks as a result of international sanctions. Around $50bn of ""useable assets"" were unfrozen as part of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated under President Barack Obama in July 2015. But Kamala Harris was not part of his administration.  There have been two agreements between the US and Iran under the Biden administration which released around $16bn in Iranian assets. One was an extension of a deal introduced by Trump in 2018 which allowed Iran to access $10bn of frozen assets.  The other was a deal between the US and Iran made in September 2023, in which prisoners were exchanged and $6bn of Iranian assets released.  The deal stated that the unfrozen funds could only be used by Iran for humanitarian purposes. BBC Verify has asked the Trump-Vance campaign what the basis for their $100bn claim is. CLAIM: Walz said: “Donald Trump hasn’t paid any federal tax in the last 15 years"". He then added “in the last year as president"". VERDICT: The first part of this claim - which was also posted on Walz's X account during the debate - is false. The second part is true.  Trump has paid tax in the last 15 years but he did not pay any in the last year of his presidency. A 2022 report, by the House Ways and Means Committee, released Trump's federal income tax returns for the years 2015 to 2020. They show he paid:  However, in 2020, his last year as president, Trump did not pay any federal income tax - so Walz was right on this one year.  CLAIM: Vance: ""We're the cleanest economy in the entire world."" VERDICT: This is false, according to two global rankings for overall environmental performance.  In 2024, the US was ranked 34th in the world overall by the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). It was 27th in the world for air quality, and 9th for water sanitation. On one measure, minimising the threats of agriculture to the environment, the US came first. Another monitoring body, the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) ranked the US 57th out of 63 countries and the European Union, in 2024.  CLAIM: Walz: “He promised... ‘I’ll build you a big, beautiful wall'... less than 2% of that wall got built.” VERDICT: Even by the most conservative estimate of how much border wall was built under Trump, this figure is exaggerated. We asked the Walz campaign about his claim and they pointed us to a report that 52 miles of “new primary wall” were built under the former president.  The US-Mexico border is almost 2,000 miles - 52 miles of wall would cover roughly 2.7% of it.  However, the length of border wall built during Trump’s presidency depends on what you are measuring.  A ‘Border Wall Status’ report in January 2021 found that - under Trump - 52 miles of “new primary wall” were built along with 33 miles of “new secondary wall”. It said that if sections in which existing barriers were replaced or reinforced were included, he built 458 miles.  President Biden suspended construction of the wall when he came into office, but last year he approved the building of 20 miles of barriers along the border in southern Texas.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jx3zp13mo,Kamala Harris goes on offensive with 'tough on border' message,"In her first visit to the border since 2021, the Democratic nominee promised ""common-sense solutions"".",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has made a rare trip to the US-Mexico border as she seeks to blunt Republican attacks on immigration. Harris, who last visited the border in 2021, accused Donald Trump of being focused on ""scapegoating instead of solutions"" and ""rhetoric instead of results"". Earlier on Friday, the Republican nominee argued Harris was ""getting killed"" on the issue and supports ""the worst bill ever drawn"" on border security. Polls suggest more Americans trust Trump over Harris on handling the border and illegal immigration. Cochise County, a conservative stronghold in Arizona that became a hot spot for record-high border crossings last autumn, provided a backdrop for the Democratic nominee to inspect the border wall, speak with local officials and project a message of toughness. She claimed Trump ""did nothing to fix our broken immigration system"" as president, adding that Republicans were trying to force a ""false choice"" between border security and a ""safe, orderly and humane"" immigration system. ""We can and must do both,"" she told supporters at a campaign event in Douglas. Harris vowed to further toughen asylum laws enacted earlier this year by President Joe Biden and to revive a bipartisan border security measure Trump helped block. But Jim Chilton, a local rancher, said he has ""seen the evidence"" of what Harris would do in power. ""I've watched her and President Biden,"" he told the BBC. ""We've had an open border policy. We now are understanding what that really means.” Every year, thousands of undocumented migrants walk through Mr Chilton's 50,000-acre ranch just south of Arivaca. He has motion-activated cameras that show the procession of people, all dressed in near-identical camouflage, across his land. He is convinced drug dealers and gang members are among them. Menacing signs threaten trespassers with death, but Mr Chilton has also installed drinking fountains so nobody dies making the hazardous journey. Three corpses were found on his land last year. A Trump supporter, Mr Chilton does not believe Harris will crack down on the flow of migrants. “She's changing her mind just to get votes and lie to us. It's outrageous,"" he said. Concerns over stemming the influx are ever present in tiny border towns like Douglas. Homeowners here can see through miles of border fencing into Mexico when they step out onto their front porches. One woman said her neighbours built brick walls around their homes to keep migrants from hiding out in their backyards. Even some Democrats here who are voting for Harris said they preferred Trump's border approach and felt safer during his tenure. Last year, a handful of churches and the town's visitor centre transformed overnight into makeshift shelters to house newcomers. Since then, the Biden administration has enacted tougher restrictions on seeking asylum and migrant crossings have plunged to four-year lows. Gail Kochorek is a dedicated volunteer who drives down to the wall to hand out food and water to people on the Mexican side, usually waiting until after dark to cross back into the US. To her, the political approach to immigration is increasingly dehumanising to people hoping to making a better life in her country. She is disappointed to hear Harris promising to crack down on migrants but, given a choice between her and Trump, the Democrat can count on Ms Kochorek's vote. Laughing at Trump's pledges to secure the border, she showed the BBC gaps in Trump's wall and where people could cut through the steel fencing. The former president has vowed to seal the border by completing construction of the barrier, increasing enforcement and implementing the largest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history. But earlier this year, he urged Republicans to ditch a hardline, cross-party border bill that was endorsed by Biden and Harris. ""That's the worst bill ever drawn. It's a waste of paper,"" Trump told supporters earlier on Friday at a rally in Walker, in the swing state of Michigan. Denying that he lobbied congressional allies to tank the piece of legislation, Trump claimed Harris ""want to see if she could salvage it and make up some lies"". ""She went to the border today because she's getting killed on the border,"" he said. In a statement following Harris's event, the Trump campaign characterised the visit as a ""drop-in"" and ""photo op"". The border crisis has been a major vulnerability for Harris. As vice-president, she has not directly shaped border policy but was put in charge of addressing the root causes of migration from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Her efforts targeted systemic issues like poverty, corruption, and violence, which for years have driven large numbers of people from these regions to make the treacherous journey to the United States. It is too soon to tell if the two-part strategy - bolstering democratic institutions and coaxing business leaders to invest in the region - is working, but Harris has taken a lot of blame for upward trends in migration. As a candidate, she has highlighted her experience as a prosecutor when she was attorney general of California, particularly in investigating transnational and cartel organisations, to emphasise her approach to tackling immigration-related challenges. Her recent remarks have aligned closely with Biden's emphasis on border security and law enforcement, but also reflect how the politics of the issue have shifted notably to the right. As she seeks to convince voters that she has a plan, her biggest challenge is finding an approach that balances the legal and humanitarian aspects of the immigration system. "

Party officials say they have identified errors in the electoral roll for December’s nationwide poll that require correction. The election authority says errors that were previously identified have been corrected.  Ghana, which has held a series of peaceful but hotly contested votes over the past three decades, is heading for another knife-edge presidential election. In the capital, Accra, demonstrators clad in red and white T-shirts, carried placards with inscriptions such as “we need justice in this election”. The NDC alleges discrepancies, including illegal name transfers, missing voters and the inclusion of the names of over 50,000 dead people. NDC director of elections Dr Omane Boamah said an independent audit of the electoral roll is the only way to ensure transparency and fairness in the electoral process. He said his party had suggested the Electoral Commision (EC) allow the UN Development Programme to facilitate the process, but that this idea was rejected. The EC has said calls for an audit are misguided and unnecessary, but the opposition warns that thousands of registered voters risk being disenfranchised if errors persist. The commission said mistakes highlighted previously have been corrected. The communications director of the governing New Patriotic Party, Richard Ahiagba, said his party has “faith in the Electoral Commission's independence to ensure a credible vote in December”. Ghana goes to the polls in December 2024 in a two-horse race between John Mahama - an opposition candidate and former president - and current Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia. Both are promising to fix the country’s poor economic situation. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Sir Ed Davey spoke to the BBC on the eve of his party's conference where the Lib Dems will celebrate their best general election ever, having secured 71 seats including seven in the east of England. The party now has MPs in Norfolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. Speaking about the previous Conservative government trying to stop the four-day work scheme, he said: ""I think a top-down approach where Whitehall tries to tell a local community that it knows best is never right."" South Cambridgeshire council became the first in the country to put staff on a four-day week in January 2023. They do 100% of their work in 80% of their contracted hours, without a reduction in pay. Even though staff sickness and turnover levels improved, and an independent report suggested the experiment was working, the last government ordered the council to stop. Just before the election, it also threatened to change the law. Speaking about the council's actions for the first time, Sir Ed said he was proud of Lib Dems in South Cambridgeshire. ""It was only a trial, they wanted to see if it would work,"" he said. ""Innovation is important but the key thing is that services to local people need to be maintained at a high level and affordable cost and I think that's what they're doing.""  The Liberal Democrats have never had so many MPs in the East of England.  Sir Ed said the party's message on the health service, social care and dirty water had resonated with voters. ""They understood that we got it,"" he said. ""We now want to make sure that we repay the trust people have put in the Liberal Democrats.  ""We lost it a while back, I think we have now regained it and we want to keep it and we'll do that by our MPs being local champions for their areas taking up the big issues like the NHS, sewage or the cost of living."" He said he wanted his party to be the main choice for voters in future elections but there were still real challenges for the party. It may have 72 MPs but the current Labour government has a majority of 174.  The Lib Dems felt the gap this week when their MPs voted against plans to cut the winter fuel allowance, with the ultimate result being that the cuts will proceed. The party has already begun preparing for next year's local elections when it hopes to play on dissatisfaction with the Tories to make further in-roads across the East, particularly in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.  How to win those elections will be discussed at this weekend's conference in Brighton, along with debates on subjects as varied as the the cost of living, reforming the Sunday Trading Laws, supporting the NHS and creating more National Parks.  Much of the conference, however, will be about celebrating a successful year which has seen a considerable change in the party's fortunes, particularly in the East.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjgqxl00xo,Trump-backed governor candidate denies 'black Nazi' post,Mark Robinson insists he will stay in the governor race in the swing state.,20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina has insisted he will not exit the race after it was reported that he made controversial comments on a porn website more than a decade ago. Mark Robinson characterised the CNN report, which alleged that he had referred to himself as a ""black Nazi"" on an adult forum, as ""salacious tabloid lies"". He has been under pressure from state Republicans and members of Donald Trump's campaign team to quit the race in the swing state, according to anonymous sources quoted by the Carolina Journal newspaper. Trump himself did not refer to the report during his comments at a Thursday night event in Washington about antisemitism. Robinson, 56, is a former furniture manufacturer who was elected to be the state's first black lieutenant governor in 2020. He won the nomination to run for governor in March after receiving an endorsement from Trump, who called him ""Martin Luther King on steroids"".  Robinson's race is in a potentially pivotal swing state which Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is hoping to wrest from the Republicans. According to the CNN report published on Thursday, Robinson used to visit a porn website from 2008-12 called Nude Africa, with the username ""minisoldr"".  According to CNN, minisoldr posted about enjoying watching ""tranny"" porn, adding: ""Yeah I’m a 'perv' too!"" The BBC has not verified the CNN report. In 2021, Robinson refused to apologise after he was criticised for saying that children in schools should not be learning about ""transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth"". In a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, as the CNN story was being published, he denied wrongdoing. ""Let me reassure you, the things you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,"" he said. ""We are staying in this race. We are in it to win it."" He said he was the victim of a ""high-tech lynching"" by his white Democratic opponent, Josh Stein. Stein's campaign said in a statement that ""North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be governor"". Opinion polls already suggest Stein, a Harvard-educated lawyer who is currently North Carolina's attorney general, has a firm lead in the race. The North Carolina Republican Party defended Robinson in a statement, saying ""the Left"" was ""trying to demonise him via personal attacks"". Trump himself did not address the controversy during Thursday night's comments to the Israeli-American Council National Summit, in which he vowed to ""stop the toxic poison of antisemitism from spreading all over America and all over the world"". He bemoaned the lack of support he said he was receiving from Jewish voters, saying if he failed to win the election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that"".  The Harris campaign posted a video on social media reminding voters of Trump's past praise for Robinson.  The deadline for withdrawing from the governor contest was on Thursday evening, as postal ballots go into the mail on Friday. Early voting in the state begins in less than a month.  Recent polling in North Carolina shows Harris and Trump effectively tied among likely voters. The Tar Heel State has been a Republican stronghold, with only one Democratic presidential nominee winning there in the last 20-plus years. Trump narrowly beat Joe Biden in North Carolina four years ago by less than 2%. Democrats have campaigned heavily in the state this election season."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3qnrpvg9o,Trump vows to 'take other countries' jobs' in economic speech,"Trump pledged that companies who manufactured in the US would receive benefits, while those who did business elsewhere would face steep costs",25 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump pledged the US would “take other countries’ jobs” if he returned to the White House, as he laid out his plans to slash taxes and lower energy costs and regulations for manufacturers that made goods on US soil.  At a campaign rally in Savannah, Georgia, Trump promised a ""manufacturing renaissance"", reiterating his pledge to punish American companies that manufactured outside the US, and slap large tariffs on foreign-made goods to protect US industries. Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris have stepped up efforts to outline their competing visions for the economy in the final stretch of the campaign, highlighting what voters say is a top concern in the 2024 election.  Harris is expected to unveil a new set of economic proposals in a major speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday. Speaking to a crowd in Savannah, Trump moved beyond his usual protectionist policies to raise the prospect of more trade battles. Trump said he would offer special federal zones with ""ultra low taxes and regulations"" to companies that relocate to the US, cut through regulation and appoint a ""manufacturing ambassador"" to convince international companies to move to the United States.  “Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations. Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,” he said. Trump has also previously proposed a 60% tariff or higher on Chinese goods and a blanket 20% tariff on imports from other countries, an aggressive policy that could increase prices for Americans, according to some economists. During his presidency, Trump imposed tariffs on some goods imported from China. The Biden administration has left some of these policies in place and announced new restrictions in some areas such as electric vehicles. The former president has sought to blame Democrats for the surge in inflation following the Covid pandemic, which has since cooled, as well as the high cost of groceries. The food Consumer Price Index rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Polls have indicated that American voters are most concerned about the economy, and more voters see Trump as equipped to handle it. Harris, however has made some gains. Voters for whom the economy was a major factor preferred Trump over Harris by 53-47%, according to CBS News/YouGov poll of likely voters published this week. But Harris has improved her standing since August, when only 43% of voters who prioritised the economy favoured her. Trump’s visit to Georgia came on the heels of a New York Times/Siena College poll that found him slightly ahead in the state, as well as the battlegrounds Arizona, and North Carolina. Both candidates have devoted significant time and resources to campaigning in Georgia, as it may prove critical to their paths to the White House. Though the Georgia speech was billed as an economic event, Trump dedicated a significant portion of his speech to other subjects. He recounted the failed assassination attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally in July and the second suspected attempt in Florida this month. He praised the US Secret Service, which has faced scrutiny over their ability to protect Trump. He also attacked Harris, calling her ""grossly incompetent"" and said she would ""deindustrialise the United States and destroy our country"". An hour before Trump spoke in Georgia, the Harris campaign held a press call with American investor Mark Cuban, who has long supported Democratic candidates. Mr Cuban assailed Mr Trump’s proposals to place tariffs on American companies which manufactured in countries like Mexico, saying it would harm American businesses. “It just goes to show that he doesn't think these things through,” Mr Cuban said. Harris will return to the another critical swing state, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday to lay out her own economic agenda.  The vice-president has already released a set of economic proposals aimed at first-time home buyers, tax breaks for families and a ban on grocery ""price-gouging"". She has called for a ""first-ever"" tax credit for builders of homes sold to first-time buyers, as well as up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance for ""eligible"" first-time buyers.  She told reporters on Sunday the plan would focus on investing ""in the aspirations and ambitions of the American people while addressing the challenges that they face""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6qvg78z8no,Ex-agent explains why protecting Trump is such a challenge,"The amount of time he spends outside, the exuberance of his fan base and the number and size of rallies are among difficulties.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump has spotlighted several issues facing the agency tasked with protecting one of the world's most high-profile men. Trump's public profile has posed a unique security and funding challenge for the Secret Service, a former agent told BBC News.  “It’s dialled up,” said Paul Eckloff, a Secret Service agent of 20 years who protected Trump during his presidency.  “The amount of time he spends outside, the exuberance of his fan base, the number and size of rallies, and the lack of military support, does make it more difficult.” The Secret Service, which protects presidents and other top US officials, was central to both incidents that threatened Trump's life.  The agency has recently raised concerns about the resources needed to fund the former president's protection detail.  Earlier this week, a Secret Service agent spotted a gunman hiding in the bushes near the former president's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course.  The agent fired on the suspect, who sped away in a car before being arrested a short time later.  This follows a July assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where another gunman opened fire and struck Trump's ear. The episode brought intense scrutiny to the Secret Service.  The agency's leadership has been hauled before Congress since then, its director resigned after intense pressure, and lawmakers have since set up a task force to examine this summer’s threats to the Republican candidate’s life. The most recent incident, meanwhile, has led to calls for new funding for the Secret Service to ensure it can adequately protect presidential candidates in a political climate that many fear could lead to more violence. As details of the apparent assassination attempt emerged, President Joe Biden told reporters on Monday that the Secret Service ""needs more help"" and Congress should respond. The agency has scaled up its efforts since July, but the calendar could prove a challenge for expediting new funding for the agency. There are fewer than 50 days until the 5 November election, and a politically split Capitol Hill is unable to agree on the next budget, which means the US could face a government shutdown on 1 October.  More money for the Secret Service could be a hard sell given those political realities.  House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the Republican leader at the centre of the congressional budget fight, dismissed the need for the Secret Service to receive budget help.  ""I don't think it's a funding issue,"" he said on Fox News. ""President Trump needs the most coverage of anyone. He's the most attacked; he's the most threatened."" But Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe wrote in a letter to Congress last week that ""increased mission requirements of the Secret Service necessitate additional resources"". The Secret Service has long worried about protecting Trump at his golf courses, the Washington Post reported, and had even tried to warn the former president about the opportunities it could provide to a would-be assailant. In 2022, then-US Secret Service Director James Murray warned US lawmakers that the agency was scrambling to keep up with the pace and scale of Trump’s rallies. He noted that the loss of the military support that a sitting president receives had put a greater strain on the agents assigned to protecting Trump after he left the White House. The Secret Service had protected presidents at rallies before. But with Trump, “the nature is different, and we're seeing sometimes two, three, four, of these rallies every month”, Mr Murray told the House Appropriations Committee at the time. Trump's pastime of golf adds a different challenge. ""The hobby of golf is particularly problematic: You're outside, an outdoor venue, for hours at a time,” said Mr Eckloff. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said on Monday that if Trump had been a sitting president, ""we would have had this entire golf course surrounded"". Other presidents, including Barack Obama, also had a penchant for playing golf while in office. But the former president frequently played on a military base, where security was easier to manage, according to Mr Eckloff, the former Secret Service agent. This week, lawmakers called for presidential candidates from both parties to receive the same level of protection as a sitting US president. The acting head of the US Secret Service said this week that Trump’s security was now at its “highest level”. Trump’s existing protection is as “near as possible to presidential-level security that can be done”, said Mr Eckloff. But, he acknowledged, “that’s not to say you couldn’t do more""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lnprjg7z0o,A guide to Donald Trump's four criminal cases,Several of the criminal cases against Trump are in limbo because of legal challenges.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Republican Donald Trump is facing off against Democratic presidential candidate and current Vice-President Kamala Harris in November's election. How might his criminal prosecutions affect his campaign? The 78-year-old is the first former president in US history to be criminally convicted, having been found guilty of falsifying business records. A few weeks later, the US Supreme Court ruled he had partial immunity in perhaps the most serious case he faces - that he tried to overturn the 2020 election result. And it was not long before the former president scored a further legal win, when a Florida judge dismissed a case related to his handling of classified documents. So what might happen next in his four criminal cases and what is at stake as he seeks to return to the White House? Whether Trump illegally conspired to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden. Federal prosecutors allege he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 to delay the certification of Mr Biden's victory and stay in power. He's been charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy against the rights of citizens. US prosecutors in August issued revised charges in an attempt to navigate a ruling from the Supreme Court, which ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for ""official acts"". A revised indictment leaves in place the four criminal counts, which Special Counsel Jack Smith has argued relate to Trump's conduct as a private citizen, using campaign efforts to try to overturn election results.  In a legal brief accompanying the indictment, Mr Smith unveiled a host of new allegations and evidence against Trump, including that the former president repeatedly ignored counsel from his advisors that he lost the 2020 election and parroted false election fraud claims that he himself called ""crazy"".  Trump has denied wrongdoing in the case and previously pleaded not guilty.  Because of the Supreme Court immunity ruling, it doesn't look like it will happen any time soon. A revised indictment shows that Department of Justice (DoJ) Special Counsel Jack Smith interprets the Supreme Court immunity ruling to mean his case can still move forward. Mr Smith's office said the superseding indictment had been presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. If Trump wins re-election, he could also in theory pardon himself or order all these charges to be dismissed. Penalties for the charges include: A conviction at trial would take the US into uncharted territory. A payment made to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Ms Daniels was paid $130,000 (£103,000) to keep quiet about her claim that she had sex with Trump, which he denies. Providing so-called hush-money is not illegal. Instead, this case was more technical and centred on how Trump's former lawyer, who paid Ms Daniels, had his reimbursement recorded as legal fees in Trump's accounts. The prosecution's key witness was ex-lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified that his former boss knew about the elaborate scheme to disguise the payment. In days of heated cross-examination, Trump's lawyers sought to undermine Cohen and paint him as an unreliable witness and convicted liar. The jurors deliberated over two days before finding the former president guilty of all 34 counts of fraud under campaign finance laws. Trump has said the case is politically motivated. His lawyers are requesting the conviction be overturned, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling. Each of the charges carries a maximum of four years in prison, although a judge could sentence Trump to probation. His sentencing has been delayed until after the 2024 election.  Legal experts told the BBC they think it is unlikely Trump will be jailed and that a fine is the more likely outcome. Trump and some 18 other defendants are accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his very narrow defeat in the state of Georgia in the 2020 election. The racketeering investigation, led by Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis, was sparked in part by a leaked phone call in which the former president asked the state's top election official to ""find 11,780 votes"". Trump was hit with 13 criminal counts, subsequently reduced to eight. They include one alleged violation of Georgia's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico). The former president has pleaded not guilty. A date has not been set. The timeline has been complicated by an effort by Trump and his allies to disqualify Ms Willis because of her romantic relationship with a man she hired to work on the case. An appeals court has tentatively set a date of 5 December - after the election - to hear oral arguments in the bid to have Ms Willis removed. The racketeering charge carries a maximum 20-year jail sentence. Georgia prosecutors would need to prove that there was a pattern of corruption from Trump and his co-defendants aimed at overturning the election result in order to bring a conviction. As for making false statements, that carries a penalty of between one to five years in prison or a fine. Whether Trump mishandled classified documents by taking them from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago residence after he left office. The case against Trump is also about whether he obstructed the FBI's efforts to retrieve the files, as well as the criminal investigation into his handling of them. The majority of the counts are for the wilful retention of national defence information, which falls under the Espionage Act. There are then eight individual counts, which include conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record and making false statements. Trump has pleaded not guilty on all counts. The case was dismissed by a Florida judge on 15 July, marking a significant legal victory for Trump just days after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, made the dismissal on the basis that the Justice Department's appointment of special prosecutor Jack Smith violated the US Constitution. Mr Smith has appealed against the decision, which came after Judge Cannon cancelled the 20 May trial date without giving a new one. Trump and his lawyers have long tried to put the case off until after the November presidential election. If the case is restarted, these charges could, in theory, lead to substantial prison time if Trump is convicted. Looking at the letter of the law, the counts under the Espionage Act each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Other counts, related to conspiracy and withholding or concealing documents, each carry maximum sentences of 20 years. But the logistics of jailing a former president mean a conventional prison sentence is seen as unlikely by many experts."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglm0rjy2go,How social media assassination conspiracies are uniting pro- and anti-Trump voters,A pro-Trump wellness influencer and a suburban Democrat share a conspiracy theory - how did it spread so far?,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Wild Mother - the online alias of a woman called Desirée - lives in the mountains of Colorado, where she posts videos to 80,000 followers about holistic wellness and bringing up her little girl. She wants Donald Trump to win the presidential election. About 70 miles north in the suburbs of Denver is Camille, a passionate supporter of racial and gender equality who lives with a gaggle of rescue dogs and has voted Democrat for the past 15 years. The two women are poles apart politically - but they both believe assassination attempts against Mr Trump were staged. Their views on the shooting in July and the apparent foiled plot earlier this month were shaped by different social media posts pushed to their feeds, they both say. I travelled to Colorado - which became a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen - for the BBC Radio 4 podcast Why Do You Hate Me? USA. I wanted to understand why these evidence-free staged assassination theories seemed to have spread so far across the political spectrum and the consequences for people like Camille and Wild Mother. Dozens of evidence-free posts I found suggesting both incidents were staged have racked up more than 30 million views on X. Some of these posts came from anti-Trump accounts that did not seem to have a track record of sharing theories like this, while a smaller share were posted by some of the former president’s supporters. For Democrat Camille, Trump’s team orchestrated this to boost his chances of winning the election. Wild Mother - who already follows QAnon, the unfounded conspiracy theory which claims Donald Trump is involved in a secret war against an elite cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles - wants to believe Trump’s own team staged the attack in order to frame his supposed enemies in the ""Deep State"". The Deep State is claimed to be a shadowy coalition of security and intelligence services looking to thwart certain politicians. There is no evidence to support either of the women’s theories. The idea that news events have been staged to manipulate the public is a classic trope in the conspiracy theory playbook. Wild Mother says she is no stranger to this alternative way of thinking. Camille, however, says this is the first time she has ever used the word ""staged"" about an event in the news like this. She always believed Covid-19 was real and she was extremely opposed to false claims the 2020 election had been rigged. But on 13 July this year, when she was sitting in front of her TV at home watching live as Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, she says she immediately thought: ""Oh, that's staged."" The way Donald Trump was able to pose for a photo and raise his fist in the air was what ignited Camille’s suspicions. She had questions about how the US Secret Service allowed the shooting to happen in the first place. The director of the service has since resigned over failings that day. The shooter was a 20-year-old called Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service snipers. His motives remain unknown – which left many questions wide open. And so Camille’s thoughts continued to spiral. Already sceptical that something did not add up, Camille turned to X for more answers. In the years before the shooting, she had already started spending more and more time on the social media site, formerly known as Twitter. She had taken an interest in pro-Democrat anti-Trump accounts and followed some of them. ""I would admit to you that I spend too much time on social media now, and it, in my mind, is kind of a problem,"" she tells me. Recent changes to how X’s ""For You"" feed works meant she started seeing more posts from accounts she does not follow, but that pushed ideas in line with her political views. Lots of these accounts had also purchased blue ticks on the site, which give their posts more prominence. So when the first assassination attempt happened, unfounded conspiracy theories suggesting it had been staged were not only recommended directly to her feed - but were all the more convincing as they came from other profiles with the same political views she holds about Donald Trump. Most of the social media companies say they have guidelines to protect users and reduce harmful content. X did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Why Do You Hate Me? USA - Episode one Marianna Spring travels from Colorado to Baltimore and New York to uncover how social media is shaping the Presidential race. It’s social media’s world and the election is just living in it. Listen on BBC Sounds. Wild Mother had also turned to social media to find her tribe - having been called ""a weirdo, an alien, a diamond in the rough"" offline - and has built a following of thousands. As we stand chatting in a waterfall in the small town she calls home, she explains how she began sharing her views on natural medicine and motherhood in 2021. Then she started posting unproven theories about what was happening behind the headlines - such as on the Princess of Wales' health or the Baltimore bridge collapse earlier this year - and saw her views and likes rack up. She says she has been immersed in what she calls this ""alternative idea about reality"" from a young age and believes we have been lied to about what really happened when John F Kennedy was assassinated in the 1960s, when 9/11 happened in 2001, and during the Covid-19 pandemic. She started to like Trump when she began spending more time online during the pandemic and became exposed to the QAnon movement, which she believes could be linking all these events. As a mum, she was especially concerned about allegations around child abuse and trafficking its supporters often talk about. ""I would never in my life even imagine some of the stuff that I've had to hear is going on right now, under our noses. And it blows my mind. We have to be able to protect our most innocent,"" Wild Mother says.  QAnon supporters were among the crowd that stormed the US Capitol building on 6 January, 2021, in a violent protest against Joe Biden's election victory. Now Wild Mother wants to believe the idea she has seen on social media that they might have been involved somehow in staging Trump's shooting in July - in order to frame the Deep State. But Wild Mother says, according to the posts she has seen online, ""good guys in the military"", known as White Hats, had been doing covert operations to counter the Deep State. And one theory that popped up on her feed claimed the July assassination attempt was staged by them to show the public the threat Trump is under. Wild Mother doesn't claim to know for sure if the QAnon theory is true - but she does know what she wants to believe. ""I think our country needs rescuing from our government right now. It's a horrible mess. A horrible mess,"" she says. Once Wild Mother started to question whether a news event could have been staged, it seemed as though any of them could be. ""It's like going to a magic show as a kid and then that you find out for the first time that the magician is pulling one over on you. Now, every time you go to a magic show, you know what they're doing,"" she tells me. As both Camille and Wild Mother came to rely more on social media, the beliefs they picked up contributed to a fracturing of their relationships in the real world. Camille finds it hard to have conversations with some of her close family who support Trump, while Wild Mother says it played a part in her separating from her now ex-husband, who she says strongly opposed conspiracy theories. ""Does it make it difficult? Yes. Did it create a wedge? Was it possibly one of the things that ended my marriage? Maybe,"" Wild Mother says. Meanwhile, Camille also found herself embroiled in arguments on X which left her with her guard up in the real world, too. ""It's a little scary because I feel like every time I leave the house, it's a potential for conflict,"" she says. This atmosphere of suspicion and conflict doesn’t just have consequences for these women’s personal lives - but for society too. Officials, election workers - and politicians around the USA have found themselves subject to hate and threats as a consequence of this wider belief that almost anything and everything - including elections - is being rigged and staged. For Wild Mother, people are ""walking a really fine line"" between seeking justice and harmful behaviour. ""It's not writing your senators and calling them racist names. But if you were somebody who truly did your research and found that there was an issue, do I agree that you should use your voice? Absolutely,"" she says. ""I think that we all have ways of doing that. For them, it just so happens to be harassing people."" While Wild Mother and Camille say they have never threatened anyone themselves - and strike me as empathetic, kind people - the mistrust fostered in part by their social media feeds has eroded their faith in society and its institutions. Camille, who was so opposed conspiracy theories, now finds herself using the language of them. She appears to be one of many recruited into this way of thinking - by July’s assassination attempt and the social media algorithms drawing people deeper into an online world detached from reality."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6q2zwy9j0o,"Trump or Harris? In a crisis-hit world, diplomats resigned to either","Behind the scenes at the United Nations, insiders tell the BBC they don't see major change whoever wins the White House.",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The annual United Nations General Assembly week is always frenetic.  It may be called the Super Bowl of diplomacy, but this year perhaps a more appropriate analogy is a marathon.  Not since World War Two have there been so many global conflicts piling up, with Lebanon on the brink just as leaders arrived in New York City. Given the current state of uncertainty, the forthcoming US election was in the back of everyone’s minds here. One senior Western diplomat told me no-one expects things to move on the Israel-Gaza war until after a winner is declared in the White House race. “We understand that the current administration is under pressure not to take any decisions that might affect the election,” he said.  “But we hope that after the election the current administration will use the interim period to maybe make some decisions that will lead to improving the situation in Gaza.” But in conversations with a dozen officials from different continents at the UN's headquarters in Manhattan, a picture emerged of a global community fatigued by crisis and resigned to working with whoever is the next occupant of the White House.  All were granted anonymity to share their candid views. ""I don’t see any difference between the two candidates, just look around the whole world from one end to the other, we are in total chaos,"" an ambassador from a South Asian nation told me. It's a sentiment that reflects perhaps disillusionment with US leadership, but also the view by many in the global south that while the rhetoric changes, America’s broad foreign policies really don’t swing that drastically from one administration to the next. “It’s very easy to bash and make alarms about what could happen,” one senior Arab representative told me. He said while he thinks former President Donald Trump is unpredictable compared to Vice-President Kamala Harris, the idea that he would rip up multilateralism is exaggerated because it didn’t happen before. ""What is really undermining multilateralism are actions and conflicts that are happening in many parts of the world, and you can’t put that on one country or on one administration,"" he said. Here at the UN complex, one longtime official of the organisation tells me there isn’t panic about the US election.  ""We have enough anxiety spread around what's going on today to worry about what's going on in November,” the official said. This source added that the UN survived the Trump administration in a way few would have predicted.  ""The volume may have been very loud, but they weren’t all that different from previous Republicans,"" the official said.  If there is a second term, the official told me their sense is that Trump will be so focused on domestic issues and ""settling scores internally"" that foreign policy might not be the focus in the beginning. Speaking to the BBC, Kenyan President William Ruto sounded unfazed. ""I am very confident that the bones of friendship between Kenya and the US transcend individuals in office,"" he said. ""It will transcend me as president or whoever is elected in the US."" For many Europeans, however, there is anxiety about a second Trump administration and what some see as his transactional approach to foreign relations.  A European diplomat told me that with the Security Council incapable of managing conflicts, there is a fear that an emboldened and potentially more radical Trump administration would add to the dysfunction and encourage more movement in Europe toward the ultra-right. “I think it would be a relief for at least the majority of Europeans if Harris comes into office,” he said. Nevertheless, another senior European diplomat said that while Harris winning would give them a sense of continuity, they also now have a relationship from working with Trump for four years and feel more prepared than in 2016. Coinciding with the UN high level debate was Climate Week in New York City. Caribbean leaders spoke not only from the green and gold General Assembly Hall, but also to rooms full of businessmen and politicians at side events to warn that the world is dangerously behind on its climate commitments, putting their islands at risk. One minister from the region told me that climate was the main area where the US candidates’ differences worried them. “In terms of having real commitment from the US government and for the US government to provide leadership,” the minister said it’s ""definitely Democrats"". Many still remember Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, while Joe Biden later rejoined. The Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, said political change has been a challenge to progress over the last 26 years. He said he’s been calling for some kind of mechanism that protects a change in political leadership from impeding or reversing progress. Election day on 5 November may feel faraway to diplomats who have been confronted with more challenges than solutions here this past week.  But the time is fast approaching when votes will be counted in the US, and with it a new face in the White House. Another European minister, running to an event, simply had this to say to me: ""My hope is that it doesn’t get too weird."" Additional reporting by Cai Pigliucci."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyejk91d2qo,Trump rejects second TV debate as 'too late',"Kamala Harris had ""gladly"" accepted CNN's invitation to debate two weeks before the presidential election.",22 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former US President Donald Trump has said he will not take part in a second TV debate ahead of November's presidential election. While Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, accepted an invitation to the CNN debate on 23 October, Republican nominee Trump told a rally it was ""too late"" as voting has already started. Harris's campaign team said that given the former president claimed to have won their previous debate in Philadelphia earlier this month he should accept. Snap polls taken after that encounter suggested a majority of viewers believed the vice-president outperformed her challenger. After the 10 September debate, Trump said there would be no further debates.  Speaking at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Saturday, he claimed victory in that earlier head-to-head and said ""it's just too late"" for another.  ""Voting has already started,"" he said, accusing Harris of seeking another round of sparring ""because she's losing badly.""  In a statement on Saturday, Harris-Walz campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said that Americans ""deserve another opportunity"" to see Harris and Trump debate before the November election.  ""It would be unprecedented in modern history for there to just be one general election debate,"" she said. ""Debates offer a unique chance for voters to see the candidates side by side and take stock of their competing visions for America."" On X, formerly Twitter, Harris said she had ""gladly"" accepted the debate invitation and hoped Trump would also take part.  CNN had said the potential debate would follow the same format as the one it broadcast in June between Trump and President Joe Biden.  Biden's faltering performance in that encounter led some Democrats to question whether he should be the party's candidate for the election.  After weeks of uncertainty the president announced he would not seek re-election - paving the way for Harris to become the nominee. At the Trump rally, some voters told the BBC they hoped another debate would take place. ""If you're not afraid, why not? They both did great [at the last debate],"" said Trump supporter Steve Castellano. Adding that he thought the moderators were ""a little biased"" at the last debate, Mr Castellano suggested some conditions for a possible rematch. ""They should debate again at a network Trump chooses,"" he said. ""What I would really love is a good podcaster [to moderate]. I'd really love Joe Rogan to do it.""  Harris holds a slight lead over Trump in national polling averages, and North Carolina could be crucial for his hopes to return to the White House.  Since then, a majority of national polls suggest that Harris has made small gains with voters.  Trump's campaign stop in North Carolina comes after the Republican candidate he endorsed for governor, Mark Robinson, reportedly made controversial comments on a porn website more than a decade ago. Robinson characterised the CNN report, which alleged that he had referred to himself as a ""black Nazi"" on an adult forum, as ""salacious tabloid lies"". Robinson did not attend Saturday's rally and Trump did not mention it during his 60-minute speech to supporters.  The two candidates exchanged swipes and barbs at the previous debate, with Trump calling Harris a ""radical left liberal"" and a Marxist who was destroying America.  Harris, for her part, goaded Trump, belittled the size of his rally crowds and quoted his Republican detractors.  CBS, the BBC's news partner in the US, has also invited both presidential candidates to participate in an October debate in Arizona. "

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevjrk0v0jxo,New council leader promises to tackle potholes,Conservative Stephen Davies has been elected as the new leader of Gloucestershire County Council.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The new leader of Gloucestershire County Council has promised to tackle potholes and focus on providing infrastructure for new housing developments. Conservative group leader Stephen Davies was elected unopposed as the new head of the authority on Wednesday. During his maiden speech, the 62-year-old former cabinet lead for children’s safeguarding and early years, said there would not be any major changes in direction but there will be some small differences as, “I’m not Mark, I’m Stephen”. ""It is a great honour to be elected leader of this fantastic council,” he added. “I am committed to continuing the long and successful track record this council has of being financially stable, responsible, and well-run. ""We have invested heavily in our roads and last year we resurfaced 212 roads and filled 50,000 potholes filled, but I want more residents to feel the benefit of that investment."" He takes over from Mark Hawthorne, who announced he was stepping down in July after 14 years in the role. Mr Davies, who has a Spanish rescue dog and enjoys traveling in his camper van, said roads, housing infrastructure, and improving Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) provision are at the the top of his ‘to do’ list. “Whilst I support the delivery of more housing in the county it must come with the infrastructure that makes it sustainable,"" he added.  “There has to be government investment in roads, schools, and other vital services where housing development is being proposed. “[I want to] make sure we are doing all we can to make accessing advice, information, and services as easy as possible for the adults and children that rely on us the most.”  However, Mr Davies could face a short tenure in the job ahead of county council elections in May 2025. The Liberal Democrats are campaigning hard for overall control, but the new Conservative leader is optimistic about his party’s chances. “We have to demonstrate that we are good at what we do and are delivering value for money,” he added. “The challenge for the Lib Dems is that it is very easy to be a protest party, and I find it incredibly difficult to know of what they would do differently to what we do.” In response, the Lib Dem group said the Conservatives are collapsing in Gloucestershire and are blaming “everyone but themselves for their failures”. Group leader, Lisa Spivey, added: “They have run out of ideas. Nothing is working. Road signs are hanging off their posts, covered in mud, there are potholes everywhere, costs for care services are spiralling out of control and children are waiting years for education needs assessments. “The only thing the Conservatives keep doing is pouring more and more money into projects and saying everything is working perfectly, when it’s clear that it’s not.” As a result of Mr Davies' new role, Stephan Fifield will become deputy leader and Paul McLain will step in as member for children’s safeguarding and early years.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqw34463wo,"Ousted president quits Gabon politics, calls for wife's release","The 65-year-old pledges not to be a threat to the military junta, which toppled him from power last August.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Gabon's deposed President Ali Bongo has announced he will quit politics a year after he was toppled from power by a military coup. ""I wish to reaffirm my withdrawal from political life and the definitive renunciation of any national ambition,"" Mr Bongo said in a letter addressed to the Gabonese people.  The 65-year-old also called for the release of his wife and son who are in detention awaiting trial on corruption allegations.  It is not clear whether his statement follows any negotiations with the military rulers, or if he is hoping that by agreeing to quit politics, he will secure his family’s freedom. Mr Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018 and his health was a major source of concern for many in the build-up to the 2023 presidential election. The army seized power last August, shortly after Mr Bongo was declared the winner of the election, which was disputed by the opposition. He had led the oil-rich country since 2009 when he succeeded his father who had been in power for more than 40 years. The family had strong links to France, the former colonial power in Gabon. The coup, led by Gen Brice Oligui Ngeuma, was greeted by celebrations at home but was condemned by regional and continental bodies, as well as France.  A week after the military takeover, the deposed president was released from house arrest but he has remained in the capital, Libreville. Gen Nguema has so far taken a conciliatory approach towards the deposed president, saying he is free to go abroad. But in his letter Mr Bongo said his movements remained restricted and subject to daily surveillance.  ""My visits depend on the authorisation of the military. Isolated from the outside world without communications, without news of my family,"" he added.  He also called for an end to the ""violence and torture"" committed against his French-born wife Sylvia and son Noureddin and said they should both be released. His wife and son are being held in pre-trial detention on allegations of embezzling public funds.  Mrs Bongo is facing charges of money laundering, forgery and the falsification of documents. She has not made any public comment on the charges. Her lawyer, Francois Zimeray, last year criticised her detention and was quoted as calling it arbitrary and illegal. Mr Bongo said both his wife and son were ""helpless scapegoats"", adding that his decision to quit active politics also applied to them.   The military authorities have not commented on Mr Bongo's statement but have denied previous claims they were torturing members of his family. Mr Bongo and his family have been accused of enriching themselves at the expense of the nation during their decades in power - an allegation they deny. Gabon is an oil-rich country, but one third of its 2.4 million people live below the poverty line, according to the United Nations. While acknowledging the shortcomings of his presidency, Mr Bongo hoped the junta would end what he termed ""national suffering"" and pleaded for national reconciliation. ""I understand that despite the achievements made under my mandates, too many Gabonese people are still suffering and this remains my greatest regret."" Gen Nguema has promised that there will be free and fair elections leading to the establishment of a new civilian government.  However, he has not publicly commented on whether or not he will run for the country’s top job in polls that are planned for next year. ""I call on my country, its leaders and my fellow citizens to renounce vengeance and to write its next history with harmony and humanity,"" Mr Bongo added, pledging never to pose any threat or trouble during the country's transition.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw5rk0ewxwo,Trump praises 'amazing' woman who tailed golf course gunman,"Donald Trump said a woman spotted his would-be assassin while driving, leading to his arrest.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has praised an “amazing” woman motorist who he said tailed an alleged gunman as he made his getaway after an apparent assassination attempt on the former president on Sunday, leading to a speedy arrest. In his first public appearance since the incident, the Republican presidential candidate told a crowd that the unnamed civilian “saw something in this guy that was bad”. She spotted the suspect running to his car and became suspicious, so followed him in her own vehicle and took pictures of his licence plate, Trump said. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested in an SUV less than an hour after he allegedly fled Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump shared the account on Tuesday night at a town hall-style event in Flint, Michigan, with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former press secretary and now governor of Arkansas. Trump was rushed to safety unharmed after Secret Service agents spotted a muzzle of a rifle sticking through the shrubbery as the former president was playing a round of golf. The Republican candidate was about 300-500 yards (275-460m) away. An agent shot in the direction of the apparent sniper’s nest before the suspect dropped the rifle and fled into a black Nissan SUV, police said. “You want to know another sort of a miracle?” Trump told the crowd after lauding the Secret Service. “So the guy's now running for his life, and he's got a car a block away or whatever.” He added: “And a woman, driving in a car, saw a man on the street, pretty busy street, running. “And she followed him. And he got into the car. And she stopped because she thought he was trouble. He looked different. “She followed him, it wasn't very far, and parked the car behind his car and started taking pictures of his licence plate.” “Seriously, who would do that?” he said, adding that “she was really amazing”. Trump said she quickly sent those images to the authorities. “Women are smarter than men,” he told the crowd, adding that he would like to meet her. Routh was stopped by police driving northbound on the I-95 highway. He appeared in court on Monday, charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obstructed serial number. More counts could follow. It was apparently the second assassination attempt targeting Trump in as many months."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c981glp4v1lo,What time is the VP debate? Everything to know for Vance v Walz,Tuesday night's head-to-head will be their first and only showdown in the 2024 presidential election cycle.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The two US vice-presidential candidates are set to face each other on the debate stage, just over a month before the White House election.  Ohio Republican Senator JD Vance will square off against Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz in New York City on on Tuesday night. This debate comes three weeks after a single presidential clash between Donald Trump, who picked Vance as his running mate, and Kamala Harris, who picked Walz.  Here's everything you need to know. The 90-minute clash will be held on Tuesday 1 October at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST) at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.  It will be aired on CBS network TV and livestreamed on platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are accessible. The forum will be moderated by CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell and by Margaret Brennan, who hosts the network's current affairs show Face the Nation.  There will be two breaks, each lasting four minutes.  The BBC will have a team of reporters in New York and in Washington providing analysis, fact checks and reactions as part of our live coverage. The BBC will show the debate live to UK and international audiences on the BBC News Channel, BBC One, iPlayer, BBC News Website and app, along with FAST/CTV platforms in the US.  The vice-presidential debate rules mirror those of the face-off between Trump and Harris last month, with one small difference: microphones will be hot.  While CBS says it reserves the right to mute the candidates' microphones, they will remain on even when it isn't a candidate's designated turn to talk.  The two will be standing, unlike the last three vice-presidential debates in previous US election cycles, when candidates were seated.  Walz will stand behind the podium on stage left - the right side on the screen. Vance will stand opposite him.  Campaign aides will not be allowed to speak to the pair during breaks. Neither will the running mates be permitted to bring pre-written notes on stage.  The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions from moderators. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes to respond. Each candidate will have one minute for rebuttals.  CBS says it will be up to Vance and Walz to fact-check each other’s statements, though “the moderators will facilitate those opportunities” during rebuttal time. There will be no live studio audience or opening statements.  Candidates will receive two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a coin toss and chose to have the final word. Walz has been preparing with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in as Vance.  He has been holding late-night and weekend sessions and studying videos of his rival. Vance is preparing with Republican congressman Tom Emmer, who represents Walz's home state of Minnesota.  He is also holding sessions with his lawyer wife, Usha Vance, and senior Trump adviser Jason Miller. It's likely Vance will target Walz - a former public school teacher and football coach - for what Republicans say was his heavy-handed Covid policies in Minnesota, including setting up a hotline to report on those breaching social distancing rules.  Vance may also criticise Walz for signing legislation last year that allows tampon dispensers to be installed in boys' toilets at public schools.  He may also accuse Walz of misrepresenting his military record. In August, the Minnesota governor acknowledged he ""misspoke"" when he said in 2018 that he had handled assault weapons ""in war"" while advocating for stricter gun laws. Walz resigned from the National Guard before his unit was deployed to Iraq. The Minnesota governor is likely to attack Vance for some of his past comments, including calling some Democratic politicians a ""bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives"".  Walz may also go after the Ohio senator for repeatedly defending baseless stories about migrants eating household pets in an Ohio town.  He may also seek to embarrass Vance over his leaked messages from 2020 in which he said Trump had ""thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0z2394ey2o,Trump warned by US intelligence of Iran assassination threats - campaign,"Donald Trump was told of ""real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him"", his campaign says.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has been briefed by US intelligence on threats from Iran to assassinate him, his campaign said. The Republican presidential candidate was briefed ""regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States"", the campaign said in a statement. It did not elaborate on the claims, and it was not immediately clear if the threats it referred to were new or had been previously reported. The Iranian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Tehran has previously denied US claims of interfering in American affairs. Trump posted on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, that there are ""big threats on my life by Iran.""  ""Moves were already made by Iran that didn’t work out, but they will try again."" An attack on him was a ""death wish by the attacker"" he said, and he thanked Congress for approving more money for the Secret Service.  ""Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months,"" Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung said in the statement. ""Law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference,"" he added. A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the US acknowledged the briefing but declined to address any specifics. It comes after Mr Trump survived an assassination attempt on 13 July, when he was wounded and another person was killed in a shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania. No motive has been determined and it remains under investigation. In the days after, US media reported that officials had received intelligence of an alleged Iranian plot against the former president. Iranian officials at the time rebuffed the allegations as ""malicious"", the BBC'S US partner CBS news reported. ""If they do 'assassinate President Trump,' which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth - If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered 'gutless' cowards!"" Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at the time. Then on 15 September, a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle poking through a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The agent opened fire as Mr Trump was playing a round of golf. US prosecutors have charged Ryan Wesley Routh, a man arrested near the golf course, with the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate. There has been no suggestion Iran was involved in either case.  Last month, the Trump campaign said some of its internal communications had been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives. In 2022, a member of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps was charged by the US with plotting to kill Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton.  The US justice department said Shahram Poursafi attempted to pay individuals in the US $300,000 (£224,000) to carry out the murder, in revenge for the US strike that killed the Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623yqdn7eeo,Venezuela's González vows to 'continue to fight' for democracy,Spain has granted asylum to Edmundo González after he left his homeland on Saturday.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González has vowed to ""continue to fight"" for democracy in his own country, after being granted asylum in Spain.  Mr González left Venezuela, after having spent weeks in hiding, arriving at the Torrejón military air base in Madrid with his wife at about 16:00 local time on Sunday (14:00 GMT).  The departure of the 75-year-old from the country followed turmoil in the wake of the 28 July elections, in which President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory - something which was disputed by Mr González, and many sections of the international community.   In an audio message distributed by his press team, he said he was ""confident that soon we will continue the fight to achieve freedom and the recovery of democracy in Venezuela"". Prior to his departure, an arrest warrant had been issued in Venezuela, with the government accusing him of conspiracy and of forging documents, among other ""serious crimes"". Thanking his supporters for expressions of solidarity and confirming his arrival in Spain, Mr González said: ""My departure from Caracas was surrounded by episodes of pressure, coercion and threats that I wouldn’t be allowed to leave."" Earlier, the country's opposition leader María Corina Machado wrote on social media that he had made the decision to leave the country because ""his life was in danger"", citing a ""brutal wave of repression"" in the election aftermath. Ms Machado, a popular candidate in the country, had been expected to run as the candidate against Mr Maduro, but was prevented from doing so at the last minute by institutions loyal to the president.  The opposition said it had evidence Mr González had won by a comfortable margin, and uploaded detailed voting tallies to the internet which suggest Mr González beat Mr Maduro convincingly. The US, the EU and the majority of foreign governments have refused to accept Mr Maduro as the winner without Caracas releasing detailed voting data to prove the result. In a statement on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr González's departure from Venezuela ""is the direct result of the anti-democratic measures that Nicolás Maduro has unleashed on the Venezuelan people, including [Edmundo] González Urrutia and other opposition leaders, since the election"". He added: ""The election results and the will of the people cannot be merely swept aside by Maduro and the Venezuelan electoral authorities. We stand with González Urrutia in his call to continue the struggle for liberty and the restoration of democracy in Venezuela."" Earlier on Sunday, Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell said: ""Today is a sad day for democracy in Venezuela."" He added that ""in a democracy, no political leader should be forced to seek asylum in another country"".  He said Venezuela needed to end its oppression of opposition leaders and free all political prisoners. Speaking at a socialist party meeting on Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez described Mr González as ""a hero who Spain will not abandon"". The country's Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Madrid would grant Mr González asylum as it was ""committed to the political rights"" of all Venezuelans. Mr González's departure came as security forces in Venezuela surrounded the Argentine embassy in the capital, Caracas, where six opposition figures have been sheltering. Venezuela's foreign ministry alleged that terrorist acts were being plotted inside."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6449gy87jo,Political violence becomes America's new norm - but is still shocking,Donald Trump is the target of an apparent assassination attempt two months after being hit by a bullet at a rally.,16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"After decades without political violence directed at a presidential candidate from one of the major parties, the US has now experienced this twice in the space of two months - with former president Donald Trump the target on both occasions. In mid-July, he narrowly avoided being shot in the head by a gunman at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The 20-year-old attacker was shot dead by a sniper. Two months later, on Sunday afternoon, during a round of golf, he was the apparent target of another would-be assassin, according to the FBI, with a suspect now in custody. Investigators said a man armed with an AK-47 style rifle was waiting in the bushes while Trump played on his West Palm Beach golf course before the alleged assailant was spotted by Secret Service agents, who opened fire. Americans have had to adjust to “new normals” in politics – large and small - on a seemingly regular basis in the past few years. The national discourse has coarsened, partisan divisions have sharpened and become more entrenched, and the standards for candidate behaviour have eroded. Given the national epidemic of gun violence, these kind of attacks are perhaps another, inevitable new normal. But for now, it is still shocking.  “Violence has no place in America,” Vice-President Kamala Harris - who is also Trump's Democratic opponent this election - said in a statement after the incident in Florida. Details of the apparent assassination attempt – the identity and motivation of the assailant in particular - will ultimately determine the impact this has on American politics. But, for the moment, it seems like – the vice-president’s comments notwithstanding - this kind of violence is increasingly part of today’s America. Donald Trump, in his first statement following the apparent attempt on his life, promised that nothing would slow him down or make him surrender. The response fits into a campaign that has often argued the former president has become a target of persecution and attack because he speaks out for the “forgotten” Americans. His words after his first near-assassination in July – “fight, fight, fight” – became a rallying cry for his supporters. “They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you,” Trump likes to say. “I’m just standing in the way.” Now the former president has another dramatic example he can use to illustrate his point.   This latest incident may not pack the emotional heft as the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, however. That attack happened at a public rally, in full view of television cameras, with the former president bloodied and defiant. One supporter was killed and two others wounded. This time around, the incident occurred on a golf course Trump owns, with the former president more removed from immediate danger. Without graphic images to replay for days, it may affect how much of an impact this has on the public’s conscience. At the very least, however, the apparent assassination attempt will generate new headlines that at least temporarily break from what has been a challenging past few days for the former president’s campaign. Trump’s defensive, uneven performance during last week’s debate against Ms Harris, criticism of his association with the conspiracy-minded Laura Loomer and Sunday morning’s social media diatribe against singer Taylor Swift will be pushed to the side. Sunday’s drama may be shocking, but with just over seven weeks remaining in this presidential campaign, there seem certain to be more twists to come.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj31mnjggdmo,"We’ll cut through Labour gloom, says Lib Dem leader",Sir Ed Davey urges Labour to be bolder in government and act to prevent an NHS “winter crisis”.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Sir Ed Davey has said his party will offer a positive alternative to the Labour government’s “doom and gloom”, in his closing speech at the Liberal Democrat conference. Sir Ed - whose party has a record 72 MPs - said the country’s problems could not be solved with “the pessimism and defeatism we’re hearing from Labour”. He urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to be bolder in government and take action to prevent a “winter crisis” in the NHS. His party is calling for a new NHS taskforce with a £1.5bn fund to help hospitals and A&E services in England to cope with high patient demand in the winter. There was a party atmosphere in the conference hall as Sir Ed took to the stage. Most of the party's MPs were seated behind their leader, with some singing along to Abba's Take A Chance On Me. Sir Ed began by paying tribute to the MPs and praising the “sacrifices” made by his wife Emily, who appeared emotional as the audience applauded. The Lib Dems have been relentless this week in hammering home their core message on the need to invest more in the NHS. And Sir Ed made health and social care the main focus of his 40-minute speech. In a new policy announcement, he called on the government to set up a task force to help NHS Trusts plan their budgets more efficiently, instead of receiving emergency funding from the government at the last minute. “The government could and should make this year the last winter crisis in our NHS,” Sir Ed said. “So I urge Labour: do not make the same mistakes the Conservative Party did. “Be more positive. Act now. Show the ambition and urgency this moment demands - and save our NHS now.” Sir Ed has been keen to position his party as “constructive opposition” to the Labour government. In his speech, he vowed to ""scrutinise"" Labour's plans carefully and ""oppose them if we think they’ve got it wrong"". But he also sought to distance himself from Sir Keir's message that ""things will get worse"" before they get better,  with “painful” choices to come in the October budget. The Lib Dem leader said he wanted to ""cut through the government’s doom and gloom with our ambition for our country"". The Lib Dems opposed the Labour government’s decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from millions of pensions, in a Commons vote last week. But the Lib Dems have not toned down their hostility towards Conservatives, who lost 60 seats to them at the election. The Lib Dems say there are 57 constituencies where they need fewer than 10,000 votes to win and most of them are held by the Conservatives. In his speech, Sir Ed said it was his party’s job to “consign the Conservative Party to the history books”. He said they have chances to “finish the job” in county council elections next May, and “across the country in the years to come”. In a personal section of the speech, Sir Ed spoke about looking after his mum when she had cancer, and his son John, who has a neurological condition and learning difficulties. He said “we won’t save the NHS, if we don’t sort out care” and urged the prime minister to work him with on this issue. While the speech mainly focused on the NHS, it did include an endorsement of US Vice-President Kamala Harris’s candidacy for the presidency. It received one of the loudest rounds of applause. “With the looming spectre of a second Trump presidency,” Sir Ed said. “How I hope and pray to see Kamala Harris defeat him this November.” His speech drew the clearest dividing lines with Labour yet, and signalled the party’s direction of travel in this Parliament. In his closing remarks, Sir Ed said: “Let’s offer real hope. Let’s build a brighter future. And let’s keep on winning, so we can make it happen.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6255djzj68o,How much security does Donald Trump get?,"Following a second apparent assassination attempt, BBC Verify looks at what security Donald Trump is entitled to.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump is returning to the scene of the first assassination attempt on him - Butler in Pennsylvania - with enhanced security from the Secret Service. The former president faced another attempt on his life in Florida last month and security around him has been ramped up.  Legislation has been passed to expand the protection around him, after warnings the Secret Service would have ""insufficient resources"" to enhance its operations without more funding. We don’t know the exact number of agents who are assigned to Trump, but according to Ronald Kessler, an author who specialises in the Secret Service, about 80 would normally be assigned to a former president at any one time. About 300 agents are assigned to the sitting president and vice-president, compared to the 90 to 100 who protect a former president, Mr Kessler said. These totals include all staff, which means Trump would not have that many agents with him in every instance.  “The shift detail is always the same - this is the close protection officers near the president - but then there’s counter-sniper teams, counter-assault teams, counter-surveillance teams,” said Michael Matranga, who worked at the Secret Service for 12 years under Barack Obama. On a day-to-day basis, former presidents wouldn’t have those additional teams, but Trump does, according to Mr Matranga. “But people need to understand that the Secret Service need to find a balance where the president can engage with constituents or enjoy a round of golf. They can’t just keep him in a bulletproof box,” Mr Matranga added. Former Secret Service agent Jason Russell told the BBC that the service was in charge of the area in the immediate vicinity of the former president.  But he added that local law enforcement would be in charge of the outer perimeter of a public space, like the golf course.  The Secret Service ramped up security before the first assassination attempt after receiving intelligence of an Iranian plot to kill Trump - and has further increased its staffing since then. During a hearing following the Pennsylvania attempt in July, the acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told lawmakers they were expanding the use of drones to check areas, improving communication and increasing the number of security agents. The Biden administration asked Congress for special permission to increase spending on the Secret Service following the assassination attempt in Florida. Congress passed legislation to boost Trump's protection on 20 September, and this was signed into law by President Biden on 1 October. The Enhanced Presidential Security Act requires the Secret Service to apply the same standards for determining the number of agents required to protect presidents, vice presidents, and major candidates running for office. BBC Verify has asked the service how many more agents have been given to Trump’s security detail but the agency has not yet responded. Mr Russell said that he had noticed “the number of agents and the number of assets that has been given to former president Trump has certainly increased”. “Once he became the nominee obviously that protection goes up to another level, where you start to get additional assets… but certainly not the level a sitting president or vice-president would have,” he added. The Washington Post has reported that senior officials at the Secret Service repeatedly rejected requests for additional protection from Trump’s security team in the two years leading up to the attempt on his life in July.  Although the agency initially denied that such requests were made, it later acknowledged that some requests from Trump's security detail may have been rejected. In September, the Mr Rowe, said security around Trump's home was now as intense as when he was president. He said he was being provided with the ""highest level"" of security. The Secret Service had a total budget of $3.1bn in the 2024 financial year. This was 9% higher than the previous year’s budget. Just over $1bn of this was allocated to “Protection of Persons and Facilities”. The service has around 8,000 staff in total, including special agents, administrative and technical personnel. Nearly half (3,671) work full-time in Protective Operations. A decade ago, there were 4,027 people assigned to protect the president and other senior officials, according to NBC News. “The whole budget of the Secret Service is about the same as one stealth bomber,” Mr Kessler said. “The whole agency is suffering with a lack of money and staff,” he added. As well as the government's request to increase spending, the Secret Service has separately told Congress that it needs more resources to carry out its duties.   “The biggest question I have is not about the Secret Service’s reaction, but how the suspect knew Trump was going to be on the golf course at that time,” Mr Matranga told us.  The gunman hid for nearly 12 hours in bushes before Trump played an unscheduled game of golf at his club in Florida. BBC Verify has been looking through Trump's recent posts on social media and he did not say that he would be playing golf at his West Palm Beach course at the time and date the assassination attempt took place. Following a rally in Las Vegas on Friday, Trump’s campaign schedule mentions no other events until a town hall speech in Michigan on 17 September. CNN has also quoted from sources who claim Trump’s visit to the golf course was a last-minute addition to his schedule. However, it would be reasonable to assume Trump could be in Mar-a-Lago at the weekend, given how frequently he travels there.  He also posted on X (on 12 September) that he would be hosting a ""State of Crypto Address"" on the evening of 16 September from Mar-a-Lago. Trump has often been filmed and photographed with members of the public at his golf course, such as in this Instagram post from July 2024. Additional reporting by Joshua Cheetham and Kumar Malhotra."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3611zjjnd2o,"Who is suspect in Trump assassination attempt, Ryan Routh?",He appears to have mixed politics and a history of support for Ukraine - as well as a number of legal issues.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The suspect in an apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who was rejected by the country's armed forces and failed to make much of a contribution to the war effort. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, who appeared in court on Monday, is from North Carolina and spent most of his life there, but most recently lived in Hawaii. He voted for Trump in 2016 but later turned against him, and made statements of support and contributions to other politicians.  Here are some of the other things we know about him.  He is suspected of going to the Trump International Golf Course in Florida on Sunday, armed with an SKS-style rifle. The FBI recovered the weapon and scope, two backpacks and a GoPro camera from an area heavy with bush cover. Law enforcement allege that Routh fled the area when a Secret Service agent fired in his direction after spotting a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes.  He is not believed to have fired his own weapon during the incident, and is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point.  Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said two officers spotted Routh's vehicle, a black Nissan, and followed it for 45 minutes. Routh was stopped on Interstate 95, a major highway, and arrested. He has been initially charged with federal firearms offences. The affidavit states that Routh's phone was in the ""vicinity"" of the covered area for 12 hours. The car, a Nissan SUV, was later determined to have number plates which belonged to a 2012 Ford which had been reported as stolen.  BBC Verify found a number of social media profiles matching Routh's name. Routh repeatedly touted his work in encouraging foreign fighters to go to Ukraine to battle against Russia. However, most of his organising appears to have happened while he was in the US, not in Ukraine, where in 2022 he was rejected by the country's International Legion due to his lack of combat experience. The FBI is still investigating his links to Ukraine and has sent out multiple requests to companies for returns on his phone and social media accounts.  There are also pro-Palestinian, pro-Taiwan and anti-China messages on his profile, including allegations about Chinese ""biological warfare"" and references to the Covid-19 virus as an ""attack"". On an X post from 2020, Routh suggested he voted for Trump in 2016 but became disillusioned, writing: ""I will be glad when you [are] gone."" Routh also posted online urging President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris to meet victims of the attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. Routh was registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina, but appears to have voted in the most recent Democratic primary in March, according to state records. In 2019 and 2020, he gave a number of small donations totalling around $140 (£106) to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising organisation, according to online federal elections records. An Associated Press photo of a truck outside Routh's Hawaii home displayed a Biden-Harris campaign sticker on the back. In the past Routh also backed candidates such as Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who has since left the party and swung behind Trump, and also declared his support for former Republican presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. Routh described himself as a ""volunteer co-ordinator"" and his ambitions to join combat were not realised. The International Legion told the BBC that Routh had ""never been part of, associated with, or linked"" with the legion ... in any capacity"". A volunteer for the legion described Routh to the BBC as a chaotic presence who kept trying to ""sneak around"" officials and was ""doing more harm than good"".  The volunteer said that Routh was in Ukraine in April 2022. ""He was not part of any unit and his activities were essentially causing chaos,"" the volunteer said. ""He was also trying to pose as some sort of official entity for all volunteers, which, again, he was not,"" she said. Routh told The New York Times in 2023 that he wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban. One Facebook post from July of this year read: ""Soldiers, please do not call me. We are still trying to get Ukraine to accept Afghan soldiers and hope to have some answers in the coming months... please have patience."" In a book self-published in February 2023, Routh grumbled about how his efforts were received in Ukraine. ""I have yet to see... the smallest amount of appreciation or respect,"" he wrote. In the book, Routh said he spent five months in Ukraine and worked on various projects including a drone-building programme. He claims his efforts ended in failure or were shut down by the authorities. The book also contains a passage where he encourages Iranian officials, that they were ""free to assassinate Trump"". A conspiracy theory that claims Routh appeared in a promotional video for the investment company BlackRock - which manages $10 trillion in assets - has gone viral. One post that has more than three million views mentions the man who tried to kill Donald Trump at a rally in July and claims: “Ryan Routh also appeared in a Blackrock Commercial just like Thomas Crooks. That means both featured in Global Wealth management firm’s Commercial. These aren’t coincidences.” Crooks did appear briefly in BlackRock promotional video that profiled one of his teachers, but there is no evidence that Routh did. ""This is completely false,"" a BlackRock spokesperson said of the claim. ""Ryan Routh has never been an employee of BlackRock nor has he appeared in any BlackRock ads. The video circulating on social media has been manipulated to falsely link Routh to BlackRock."" The post featured a short video clip containing Routh, and claims it is from a Blackrock commercial. BBC Verify searched key frames from the video for previous versions online and confirmed that it comes from a political rally in Kyiv which was posted in May 2022. Visible in the video are several banners of the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian military unit. Routh supported Ukraine’s fight against Russia and was known to have visited the country in recent years. Records show Routh’s legal issues go back to the 1990s, including a variety of felonies and misdemeanours, including numerous charges for stolen goods. He was charged and convicted of numerous felony offences in Guilford County in North Carolina between 2002 and 2010, according to online records. In 2002, he was charged for possession of a fully automatic machine gun, which was referred to in court filings as a ""weapon of mass destruction"".  A local newspaper report from the time noted that he barricaded himself in a business and had a three-hour stand-off with police officers in the town of Greensboro before being taken into custody.  In another incident, records show him being charged with misdemeanours including a hit-and-run, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation. His alleged offences also include driving with a revoked licence and possession of stolen property. In 2019, the FBI also received a tip that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm. The unverified tip was passed on to local law enforcement in Honolulu. Former neighbour Kim Mungo describes Routh as a ""sweetheart"" and said federal agents once raided Routh's property. She alleged that he used to keep ""loads of stolen property and stuff"" at his home, and said she saw Routh and his family firing guns in the open. Routh's eldest son, Oran, described his father as ""a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man"". He told CNN: ""I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I've heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent."" Friends and family members are being sought for interviews by the FBI, including in North Carolina and Hawaii.  Routh appeared in front of a judge on Monday at the Palm Beach County court near Mar-a-Lago, charged with firearms offences.  The charges against him did not include any references to trying to kill Trump, though the FBI has said it is investigating Sunday's incident as an assassination attempt. Law enforcement stated after the court appearance that the suspect did not fire a weapon and did not have a line of sight on Trump. Secret Service and Homeland Security agents have searched Routh's former home in Greensboro, North Carolina. A hearing is scheduled for next Monday to determine whether he should remain in custody.  Prosecutors say he is a flight risk and a danger to the community."

The men were accused of leading an attack on both the presidential palace and the home of an ally of President Félix Tshisekedi in May. Christian Malanga, a US national of Congolese origin, the suspected leader of the plot, was killed during the attack, along with five others. In total 51 people were tried in a military court, with hearings broadcast on national TV and radio. Malanga's son Marcel, one of the US citizens sentenced to death, previously told the court that his father had threatened to kill him unless he took part.  His friend Tyler Thompson, was also given the death penalty. The pair, aged in their 20s, had played football together in Utah.  His stepmother Miranda Thompson in June told the BBC the family had ""zero idea"" how he had ended up in DR Congo. ""We were in complete shock as to what was happening, and the unknown. Everything we were learning was what we were getting off Google,"" she said. The third American, Benjamin Zalman-Polun, had business interests with Christian Malanga. Also sentenced to death was Jean-Jacques Wondo, a dual Congolese and Belgian citizen. Human Rights Watch previously described him as a prominent researcher on regional politics and security, and suggested the evidence connecting him to the coup attempt was thin. The AFP news agency reports that the Briton and Canadian nationals were of Congolese origin.  The court heard the British national, Youssouf Ezangi, had helped recruit some of the others who took part. Of the 51 tried, 14 people were acquitted and freed, with the court finding they had no connection to the attack. Those convicted have five days to appeal against their sentences. Death sentences have not been carried out in DR Congo for roughly two decades - convicts who receive the penalty serve life imprisonment instead. The government lifted this moratorium in March this year, citing the need to remove ""traitors"" from the nation’s dysfunctional army. However, no death penalties have been carried out since. The attempted coup began in the capital, Kinshasa, in the early hours of 19 May. Armed men first attacked parliamentary speaker Vital Kamerhe’s home in Kinshasa then headed to the president’s official residence. Witnesses say a group of about 20 assailants in army uniform attacked the palace and an exchange of gunfire followed. An army spokesman later announced on national TV that security forces had stopped ""an attempted coup d'etat"". Local media reports said the assailants were members of the New Zaire Movement linked to Malanga, an exiled DR Congolese politician. Malanga was shot dead in the attack after resisting arrest, said army spokesperson Brig Gen Sylavin Ekenge. President Tshisekedi was re-elected for a second term in disputed elections last year in December. He won about 78% of the vote. DR Congo is a country with vast mineral wealth and a huge population. Despite this, life is difficult for many people, with conflict, corruption and poor governance persisting. Much of the country's natural resources lie in the east where violence still rages despite Mr Tshisekedi's attempts to deal with the situation by imposing a state of siege, ceasefire deals and bringing in troops from neighbouring countries.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248g49nveo,Walz says he 'misspoke' in personal story about Tiananmen Square,"""I’m a knucklehead at times,"" the Democratic running mate says, conceding he was in the US when Chinese forces crushed protests.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz has admitted during a live television debate that he ""misspoke"" when he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Kamala Harris' running mate was asked by a debate moderator why he had repeatedly said over the years he was in Hong Kong as China’s communist rulers crushed pro-democracy protests, when he was in fact back in his home state of Nebraska. Walz, who is governor of Minnesota, said: “I’ve not been perfect and I’m a knucklehead at times.” It was not the first time Walz has fallen afoul of fact-checkers this campaign cycle. His opponent on the debate stage, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, has also courted controversy with unfounded claims in this campaign, most notably about Haitian immigrants eating pets.  In Tuesday night's CBS debate in New York City, the moderator asked Walz to explain why he had claimed he was in Hong Kong when Chinese forces killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of anti-government protesters in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on 4 June 1989, shocking the world. Walz touted his work as a teacher, congressman and governor, before saying he sometimes gets ""caught up in the rhetoric"". When pressed by the moderator about the timing discrepancy, Walz replied: ""All I said on this was, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just - that's what I've said."" He has previously said he was in Hong Kong a month before Tiananmen Square, then forged ahead with a yearlong teaching stint in the country in mainland China after the massacre. But news reports from the time show Walz was in Nebraska until that August, when he left for China. Republicans have branded him ""Tiananmen Tim"". Walz has also recently revised the amount of times he has been to China. In a 2016 interview he said he had visited the country ""about 30 times"". But the Harris-Walz campaign told US media this week the number of trips Walz took to China is ""likely closer to 15"". This is not the first time that the Harris-Walz campaign has acknowledged the running mate ""misspoke"". Aides for the Democratic ticket issued a clarification in August as it emerged Walz had talked in 2018 about ""weapons of war that I carried in war"" as a member of the National Guard. But Walz never served in combat. This summer he said he and his wife started their family thorough IVF - a fertility treatment that became politically charged this election cycle. His wife later clarified they used a different treatment, intrauterine insemination.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9lk4jpr12o,Ex-UKIP leader and 'father of Brexit' dies,"One of the ""fathers of Brexit"" was a Euro MP for the East of England, serving alongside Nigel Farage.",10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A former leader of the UK Independence Party who was also the party's first MEP in the East of England has died aged 90. Jeffrey Titford was described by a former colleague as ""one of the fathers of Brexit"".  Previously an undertaker from Essex, Mr Titford began his political career as a Conservative councillor in Clacton before joining the  Referendum Party, which later merged with UKIP. In 1999, he was one of the first UKIP politicians to be elected to the European Parliament in Strasbourg/Brussels.  Mr Titford was a passionate Euro-sceptic who devoted his retirement to campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union. ""If I can influence anybody into believing, as I do, that the EU is wrong for Britain, I shall have achieved my objective,"" he told the BBC in 2008. That objective was realised in 2016 as the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum, officially leaving in 2020 after more than three years of political wrangling with the EU and within the UK Parliament. He was one of the first to join James Goldsmith's Referendum Party and stood in Harwich in the 1997 general election where he came fourth polling 9% of the vote when the seat was won by Labour's Ivan Henderson. Two years later, when proportional representation was used for the first time in European Parliament elections in the UK, he stood as a UKIP candidate and became one of eight MEPs representing the new East of England constituency, which included Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.  ""The polls have said that seven out of 10 people don't want to have anything to do with the Euro [currency] and nearly 50% want to withdraw from the European Union,"" he said at the time. ""All it needed was a party to stand up for those two principles.""  He led the party for almost three years in 2000 and again, briefly, as acting leader in 2010 before Nigel Farage took over in the run-up to the decisive 2016 Brexit poll. He was highly respected within the party for his calm manner and ability to bring people together and resolve arguments - no mean feat for a party which was regularly beset by infighting.  His former colleague and close friend Stuart Gulleford described Mr Titford as ""a visionary and a democrat, who did not believe that EU membership provided a viable future for Britain as an independent, self-governing nation"". ""He was one of the fathers of Brexit,"" he said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyldy1122zo,Obama urges black men to mobilise behind Harris,The former president also made his debut on the campaign trail on behalf of the Democratic nominee.,3 days ago,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former US President Barack Obama has made an impassioned plea to black men to get behind the Democratic nominee. In an unannounced stop at a Harris campaign field office in the swing state of Pennsylvania, he chided male voters ""coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses"" not to support a woman for president. Obama later mocked Donald Trump for ""crazy conspiracy theories, the two-hour speeches, word salad"" as he debuted on the 2024 campaign trail. Also on Thursday, the Republican nominee spoke in battleground Michigan, warning of ""a mess"" for the whole country if Harris is elected.   With only 25 days to go until election night in America, the presidential race is as tight as ever - and a winner will likely be determined by ballots in a handful of closely contested states in the mid-west and south-west. Harris has been seeking to shore up support among black voters, but a poll by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in September indicated that one in four black men under 50 said they would support Trump over Harris in November. Obama, the nation's first black president, suggested that sexism was at play for why hesitation “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers”. ""I’ve got a problem with that,” he said. “Because part of it makes me think - and I’m speaking to men directly - part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” Running through Harris's policy proposals, Obama added she was ""somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences"", while Trump ""has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person"". But Democrat Nina Turner, a former Bernie Sanders surrogate, questioned why black men were ""being lectured to"" and ""belittled in ways that no other voting group is"". ""Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong,"" Turner told CNN. The ex-president remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party and, headlining a Harris campaign rally in Pittsburgh later, he sought to energise supporters with a sharp-tongued attack on Trump. Comparing him at one point to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Obama said ""Trump’s behaviour, the bullying and the putting people down... is not what real strength is and has never been”. “Get off your couch and vote. Put down your phone and vote. Grab your friends and family and vote,” he said. Harris herself campaigned on Thursday in Nevada, where she is trying to boost support among Latino voters who could tip the contest in her favour there. Meanwhile, Trump brought his own campaign message to Detroit, Michigan's largest city and a hub of US auto manufacturing. Addressing an audience at the Detroit Economic Club, he spoke for over an hour about a wide range of topics from voting rules to tariffs on China, with much of his speech focused on a claim that the domestic auto industry is failing. He accused the Biden-Harris administration of ""destroying our country"", adding that several years of weak leadership had allowed large companies to ""come in and raid and rape our country"". Trump also presented a new policy of tax deductions on auto loan interest, one in a flurry of populist-friendly economic proposals he has suggested in the closing stretch of the campaign. But the remarks were overshadowed by a moment in which the three-time Republican candidate bashed the city he was in and from whose voters he is seeking support. ""I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on [Harris's] list. The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth?"" he said.  ""It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands."" State and local leaders slammed the comments, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer defending the city as ""the epitome of 'grit,' defined by winners willing to get their hands dirty to build up their city and create their communities - something Donald Trump could never understand"". ""So keep Detroit out of your mouth. And you better believe Detroiters won’t forget this in November,"" Whitmer, a Harris ally, said. The Trump campaign later clarified to US media that Trump was arguing the city had “suffered from globalist policies championed by Kamala Harris” and that ""his policies will usher in a new era of economic success and stability for Detroit, helping the city reach its fullest potential”. On Friday, Trump will home in on illegal immigration - a topic that polls suggest voters trust him to handle better than Harris - as he visits Aurora, Colorado - a city that some Republicans have claimed is being overrun by Venezuelan migrant gangs. He will also speak in Nevada, while Harris plans to speak in adjoining Arizona.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwwqkgzx0o,Gunman lurked for hours before Trump's last-minute game of golf,West Palm Beach residents are stunned the suspect was able to hide undetected at the course for nearly 12 hours.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A gunman hid for nearly 12 hours in bushes before Donald Trump played an unscheduled game of golf at his oceanfront club in Florida – leaving locals stunned at what authorities say appears to be the second attempt to assassinate the former president in as many months. It was hot and cloudy on Sunday afternoon when Trump and his good friend, real estate developer Steve Witkoff, arrived on the course of Trump International Golf Club  in West Palm Beach. The former president was on the fifth fairway at 13:31 EDT (17:31 GMT), an area adjacent to busy roads near Palm Beach International Airport, when a member of his protection detail spotted a rifle poking out of foliage by the sixth hole. Trump - who was evacuated unharmed - recounted on Monday night that he heard “probably four or five” shots ring out in the near-distance. A quick-thinking Secret Service agent had opened fire in the direction of the suspect, who was about 300-500 yards away and did not have a clear line of sight to Trump, federal investigators said. ""Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me,"" said Trump during a live-streamed event on X, formerly Twitter, from his Mar-a-Lago resort.  ""We got into the carts and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job."" The gunman - who investigators say did not fire any shots - was concealed by the well-manicured shrubbery and tall palm trees that line the perimeter of the 27-hole course. He had been lurking there on the public side of a fence since 01:59 local time on Sunday morning, according to mobile phone records, cited by federal officials. The suspect was equipped with two digital cameras, a black plastic bag of food, an SKS-style semi-automatic rifle - a weapon with a range of nearly 440 yards - and a scope which magnifies the target to help shooters aim. The Republican presidential candidate’s last publicly scheduled campaign event had been on Saturday evening, on the other side of the country, in the state of Utah. Residents say Trump spends almost every Sunday at the West Palm Beach golf club when he is not on the campaign trail. But Secret Service director Ronald Rowe said on Monday that the former president was “not even really supposed to go there”, so agents had to put together a security plan at the last minute.  The foiled plot has left Trump’s neighbours in Palm Beach with pressing questions. Did the suspect know the former president would be coming to play golf, or was it a guess? How could he have gone undetected for so long, hiding in the bushes with a rifle? The gunman escaped the scene in a black Nissan, ditching his backpack of goods and weapon. A civilian woman was able to take a picture of his licence plate and pass it to investigators, Trump said on Monday night. The gunman made it about 40 minutes before officers pulled over his vehicle on Interstate 95 and ordered him out. Bodycam footage shows he seemed calm as officers shouted at him to step to the side before handcuffing him without incident. On Monday, the suspect Ryan Routh, 58, appeared in a crowded Palm Beach court, wearing a blue prison jumpsuit and smiling as he chatted with his attorney. He was charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow. Mr Routh, a Hawaii resident with a criminal history, had come across the FBI’s radar in 2019 for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The bureau tipped off law enforcement in Honolulu at the time. While his motive for allegedly planning to target Trump has not been revealed, the suspect had said in the past on social media that he voted for the Republican in 2016 before souring on him. On the perimeter of Trump’s golf course on Monday, bright orange cones, barricades, police cars and officers shielded all corners of the club. The incident has shocked West Palm Beach and neighbouring towns. Shelby Stevens, a 52-year-old Trump supporter from West Palm Beach, told the BBC: “No matter how much security you have and everything else, if someone is willing to give their life to take someone else’s, it can happen.” Cosme Blanco has lived just a few blocks away from the course for most of his life, where he said Trump comes as often as twice a week when he’s not campaigning. The 61-year-old Trump supporter said the security presence around the golf club is typically not overwhelming. But all that changed on Sunday, when Mr Blanco ran outside five minutes after shots were fired to see helicopters circling the neighbourhood. “I was concerned. I’m going to be 62 years old and I’ve never seen America change this much,” said the Cuban immigrant. Mr Blanco said it would not be hard for a suspect to target Trump at his golf course. The former president travelled there in a motorcade that would have taken about 12 minutes to go from Mar-a-Lago across a bridge overlooking the Lake Worth Lagoon. “If they see the motorcade coming, I’m sure at that point they know he’s going to play golf - it’s common sense,” Mr Blanco said. But Anka Palitz, a Palm Beach resident who says she has known Trump personally for years, said Routh’s timing was suspicious. “He doesn’t play golf every Sunday,” she said. “I think there’s a conspiracy.” “How was he [the gunman] not seen?” she added. Ms Palitz, who said she used to go skiing with Trump’s ex-wife, Ivana, said she believed someone must have alerted the suspect that the former president was going to the course that day. Patricia Pelham, a United Kingdom native who has been living in Florida for 30 years, wondered where the suspect was able to park his car close enough to quickly make a getaway. “How come there’s not security around the outside?” asked the Briton, who added that she was no supporter of Trump. Ms Pelham said security measures have increased around Mar-a-Lago on the island of Palm Beach since Trump was injured when a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. On Monday, police cars lined the roads of the island nearly every half mile, with the 17-acre resort blocked off to visitors. Authorities have said that the entire golf course would have been surrounded had it been a sitting president of the United States on the green. After blaming White House rhetoric for the latest alleged attempt to kill him, Trump said on Monday night that he had had a ""very nice call"" with President Joe Biden about boosting Secret Service protection.  President Biden, a Democrat, asked Congress on Monday to approve more money for the agency in the coming weeks, saying the Secret Service ""needs more help"". Michael Matranga, a former Secret Service agent who worked for former President Barack Obama, said Trump has had better security than many other former presidents, who typically receive less protection than White House incumbents. For example, he said, former presidents aren’t typically offered counter-sniper teams like Trump. The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since the first attempt on Trump’s life, with the leader of the agency, Kimberly Cheatle, resigning less than two weeks after the rally. Agency officials have said the Secret Service is short on resources.  But even with the extra resources, Mr Matranga said agents are forced to contend with a delicate balance of protecting Trump while allowing him to engage with constituents on the campaign trail and “enjoy a round of golf”. They can’t just “keep him in a bullet proof box”, Mr Matranga said. Nor does Trump seem to want to be put in one. In a fundraising email sent on Monday afternoon, he told his supporters: “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” It’s the kind of “tough” attitude that Mr Stevens expects Trump to maintain as he continues to court voters in the weeks leading up to November's general election. “The way I see him, he’s not going to want the American people to know that he’d be afraid of going out,” Stevens said. “I think he’ll still make a presence, not just here but everywhere. I don't think that’s something he’s going to be shying away from.” SIMPLE GUIDE: Everything you need to know about the vote EXPLAINER: Seven swing states that could decide election FACT CHECK: Was US economy stronger under Biden or Trump?

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjlnevwdzvo,Tanzania leader condemns killing of opposition figure doused in acid,"President Samia Suluhu Hassan says she will not tolerate such ""brutal acts"".",9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan has denounced the brutal killing of a senior member of the main opposition party Chadema, who was kidnapped, beaten and doused with acid.  On Friday, Mohamed Ali Kibao, 69, was forced off a bus by suspected security agents while travelling from the country's biggest city, Dar es Salaam, to his hometown Tanga. The post-mortem found that Mr Kibao had been “severely beaten and had acid poured on his face”, party chairman Freeman Mbowe told the AFP news agency.  His death comes amid concern by the opposition and rights groups of a clampdown on political activity.  President Samia condemned the “brutal acts” and called for an investigation into the murder.  “I have ordered the investigation agencies to bring me detailed information about this terrible incident and others like this as soon as possible,” she said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Our country is a democracy, and every citizen has the right to live,” she added. Hundreds turned out for Mr Kibao's funeral in Tanga, where people called for Home Affairs Minister Hamad Masauni to step down as he tried to address the mourners. “Where is the government? People are being abducted and [there is] no action. Minister Masauni resign, resign, resign,“ they shouted. Mr Mbowe, who was also at the funeral, intervened, urging the crowd to allow the minister to complete his speech. The US Embassy in Tanzania voiced their support for an “independent, transparent, and prompt investigation” into the killing of Mr Kibao. “We cannot allow our people to continue disappearing or being killed like this. The lives of Chadema leaders are currently at risk,” Mr Mbowe told AFP.  Mr Kibao was a retired military intelligence officer and joined Chadema in 2008. The killing of Mr Kibao has sparked widespread condemnation across Tanzania, with many asking the government to take action over reports of several other people being abducted and killed. The US Embassy in Tanzania said: ""Murder and disappearances, as well as last month’s detentions, beatings, efforts to disenfranchise citizens ahead of elections, should have no place in a democracy"". Last month senior Chadema leaders, Mr Mbowe and his deputy Tundu Lissu, were arrested after they attempted to hold a youth rally.  Police banned the rally, saying it was intended to cause violence. In July, an artist was accused of burning an image of President Samia and sentenced to two years in prison. Many people fear Tanzania could be returning to the repressive rule of late President John Magufuli, despite his successor Ms Samia lifting a ban on opposition gatherings and promising to restore competitive politics. In August, Human Rights Watch said the increase in arrests of opposition activists was a ""bad sign"" with the 2025 presidential elections around the corner.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5eewvy3nlo,What we know about the apparent Trump shooting attempt,"The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, remains in custody and has been charged with firearm offences.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump was rushed to safety on Sunday after what the FBI termed an apparent assassination attempt at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested and charged with firearms offences.  The incident comes almost exactly two months after a shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which left the Republican nominee with minor injuries and killed a man in the crowd. Here is what we know so far about Sunday. The incident unfolded at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, about 15 minutes from Trump's Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago.  A gunman was first seen by Secret Service agents, who were sweeping the course. Agents usually go one hole ahead to perform security checks, according to police. The muzzle of a rifle - an SKS semi-automatic - was spotted sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course.  At the time, Trump was about 300-500 yards (275-460m) away from the spot.  An agent ""immediately engaged"" with the person holding the rifle, who fled, Sheriff Rik Bradshaw said. The suspect did not fire his weapon during the incident.  On 16 September, acting Secret Service director Ron Rowe said Trump was ""across the course and out of sight of the sixth green"" when the Secret Service agent opened fire.  At no point is the suspect believed to have had a clear line of sight to the former president.  Records show that Routh's phone had been in the area for about 12 hours, from around 02:00 to 13:31 local time, according to court documents and police officials.  Agents fired four to five rounds of ammunition upon seeing the gun muzzle.  The suspect dropped the rifle and fled in a vehicle, abandoning the weapon along with two bags, a scope for his rifle and a GoPro camera, Sheriff Bradshaw said. A witness saw the gunman flee from the shrubbery to a black Nissan SUV, the sheriff said. The witness captured a photo of the vehicle and provided it to law enforcement. The suspect was arrested by police driving northbound on the I-95 highway after crossing into Martin County, roughly 61km (38 miles) from Trump's golf course.   The car was later determined to have licence plates belonging to a 2012 Ford that had previously been reported stolen.  Routh has an extensive criminal history dating back to the 1990s.  In 2002, he was convicted in Greensboro, North Carolina, for possession of a fully automatic machine gun - characterised as a weapon of ""mass death and destruction"".  In March 2010, he was convicted in North Carolina of multiple counts of possession of stolen goods. In 2019, the FBI also received a tip that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm. The unverified tip was passed on to local law enforcement in Honolulu.  He visited Ukraine after Russia's full invasion and tried to recruit volunteers to fight for Kyiv. The International Legion of foreign fighters said he was never a member, and one volunteer stated he was a hindrance during his visit. Trump - who was not injured - said a day after the shooting that ""everything was beautiful, nice place to be, and all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air"".  He said the Secret Service knew ""immediately"" it was gunshots and they grabbed him before ""everybody just got into the [golf] carts, and we moved along"".  ""I was with an agent and the agent did a fantastic job, there was no question that we were off that course,” Trump said.  The gunshots turned out to be from an agent firing at Routh, Trump said in the livestream.  ""The Secret Service did a great job, everybody did a great job,” he said later in the interview. Real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, who was with Trump at his golf course on Sunday, echoed the former president. ""I saw the Secret Service do exactly what they're supposed to do, which was get right on top of the president,"" he told Good Morning America.  ""The Secret Service was whisking him out of there, getting him back to the club house, as he's the first priority,"" Witkoff said. The former president has sought to blame President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris - his rival in November's election - for the attempt.  ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at,"" Trump said.  The White House said both Biden and Harris had called Trump to convey their relief that he was unhurt. Leaders from the bipartisan congressional task force set up to investigate the 13 July assassination attempt in Pennsylvania said they were also thankful the former president was not harmed, ""but remain deeply concerned"". The task force has requested a briefing with the Secret Service. Routh appeared in court for a hearing that lasted less than 10 minutes a day after his arrest.  It was not an arraignment - meaning he did not enter a plea - but the charges against him were read in court. They included possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obstructed serial number.  He will appear in court again next Monday.  Palm Beach County's state attorney, Dave Aronberg, told US media that Routh could face ""a lot of time in prison"". The charges made against him carry a maximum term of 20 years in jail.  The FBI is now leading the investigation. North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw3wn6geewo,US sanctions Maduro allies linked to Venezuela's disputed election,The US says those sanctioned 'impeded a transparent electoral process' in Venezuela.,12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The United States has announced it is placing sanctions on 16 officials who are closely aligned with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro following his disputed election victory. The US Treasury said it was targeting ""key officials involved in Maduro’s fraudulent and illegitimate claims of victory and his brutal crackdown on free expression following the election"". Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), which is closely aligned with the government.  But the CNE has not published any detailed voting tallies supporting a Maduro victory. Data published by the opposition suggests its candidate, Edmundo González, won instead. The US has refused to recognise Maduro as the winner and says it is convinced González received more votes.  It is also among the dozens of countries which has called on the CNE to release the detailed voting tallies which show the results from individual polling stations.  All those named in the Treasury statement are barred from entering the US and any property they hold there is blocked.  Among those sanctioned is Rosalba Gil, one of the five members of the CNE. US authorities have also targeted five judges from Venezuela's Supreme Court, which upheld the CNE's decision to award Maduro a third consecutive term in office. Members of Venezuela's security forces have also been sanctioned, with the US Treasury accusing them of being ""responsible for intensifying repression through intimidation, indiscriminate detentions, and censorship"". More than 2,400 people have been arrested in the post-election crackdown launched by the Maduro government, with many accused of ""terrorism"". Opposition candidate González fled to Spain on Saturday after being accused of  ""serious crimes"" including the ""usurpation"" of public duties, document falsification, instigation of disobedience and system sabotage. The judge who issued González's arrest warrant is also among the 16 on the sanctions list.  González has requested asylum in Spain and on Thursday met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. He said that despite now being in exile his ""determination to continue the fight to uphold the sovereign will of the Venezuelan people as expressed on July 28 by more than eight million voters"" has not wavered.  ""The fight is to the end, when all our families can finally be reunited on Venezuelan soil,"" he added. González had replaced opposition leader María Corina Machado on the ballot after the latter was barred from running for the presidency by institutions loyal to Maduro.  Machado remains in hiding in Venezuela from where she says she will lead the fight to have González sworn in as president on 10 January 2025 - the day the new presidential term is due to start. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c781vgy3918o,"Bowen: Year of killing and broken assumptions has taken Middle East to edge of deeper, wider war","Twelve months on from the 7 October attacks which led to Israel's war in Gaza, our international editor says the region is on the edge of something even worse.",6 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Millions of people in the Middle East dream of safe, quiet lives without drama and violent death. The last year of war, as bad as any in the region in modern times, has shown yet again that dreams of peace cannot come true while deep political, strategic and religious fault lines remain unbridged. Once again, war is reshaping the politics of the Middle East. The Hamas offensive came out of well over a century of unresolved conflict. After Hamas burst through the thinly defended border, it inflicted the worst day the Israelis had suffered. Around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, phoned President Joe Biden and told him that “We’ve never seen such savagery in the history of the state”; not “since the Holocaust.” Israel saw the attacks by Hamas as a threat to its existence. Since then, Israel has inflicted many terrible days on the Palestinians in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 people, mostly civilians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Much of Gaza is in ruins. Palestinians accuse Israel of genocide. The war has spread. Twelve months after Hamas went on the offensive the Middle East is on the edge of an even worse war; wider, deeper, even more destructive. A year of killing has stripped away layers of assumptions and illusions. One is Benjamin Netanyahu’s belief that he could manage the Palestinian issue without making concessions to their demands for self-determination. With that went the wishful thinking that had comforted Israel’s worried Western allies. Leaders in the US and UK, and others, had convinced themselves that Netanyahu, despite opposing a Palestinian state alongside Israel all his political life, could somehow be persuaded to accept one to end the war. Netanyahu’s refusal reflected almost universal distrust of Palestinians inside Israel as well as his own ideology. It also torpedoed an ambitious American peace plan. President Biden’s “grand bargain” proposed that Israel would receive full diplomatic recognition by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Islamic country, in return for allowing Palestinian independence. The Saudis would be rewarded with a security pact with the US. The Biden plan fell at the first hurdle. Netanyahu said in February that statehood would be “huge reward” for Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of the ultra-nationalist extremists in his cabinet, said it would be an “existential threat” to Israel. The Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, presumed to be alive, somewhere in Gaza had his own illusions. A year ago, he must have hoped that the rest of Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance” would join, with full force, into a war to cripple Israel. He was wrong. Sinwar kept his plans to attack Israel on 7 October so secret that he took his enemy by surprise. He also surprised some on his own side. Diplomatic sources told the BBC that Sinwar might not even have shared his plans with his own organisation’s exiled political leadership in Qatar. They had notoriously lax security protocols, talking on open lines that could be easily overheard, one source said. Far from going on the offensive, Iran made it clear it did not want a wider war, as Israel invaded Gaza and President Biden ordered American carrier strike groups to move closer to protect Israel. Instead, Hassan Nasrallah, and his friend and ally, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, restricted themselves to rocketing Israel’s northern border, which they said would continue until a ceasefire in Gaza. The targets were mostly military, but Israel evacuated more than 60,000 people away from the border. In Lebanon, perhaps twice as many had to flee over the months as Israel hit back. Israel made clear it would not tolerate an indefinite war of attrition with Hezbollah. Even so, the conventional wisdom was that Israel would be deterred by Hezbollah’s formidable fighting record in previous wars and its arsenal of missiles, provided by Iran. In September, Israel went on the offensive. No one outside the senior ranks of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Mossad spy agency believed so much damage could be inflicted so quickly on Iran’s most powerful ally. Israel remotely exploded booby-trapped pagers and radios, destroying Hezbollah’s communications and killing leaders. It launched one of the most intense bombing campaigns in modern warfare. On its first day Israel killed about 600 Lebanese people, including many civilians. The offensive has blown a big hole in Iran’s belief that its network of allies cemented its strategy to deter and intimidate Israel. The key moment came on 27 September, with the huge air strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut that killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah and many of his top lieutenants. Nasrallah was a vital part of Iran’s “axis of resistance”, its informal alliance and defence network of allies and proxies. Israel broke out of the border war by escalating to a bigger one. If the strategic intention was to force Hezbollah to cease fire and pull back from the border, it failed. The offensive, and invasion of south Lebanon, has not deterred Iran. Iran seems to have concluded that its open reluctance to risk a wider war was encouraging Israel to push harder. Hitting back was risky, and guaranteed an Israeli response, but for the supreme leader and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, it had become the least bad option. On Tuesday 1 October, Iran attacked Israel with ballistic missiles. ___ Kibbutz Kfar Aza is very close to the wire that was supposed to protect Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip. The kibbutz was a small community, with modest homes on an open-plan campus of lawns and neat gardens. Kfar Aza was one of Hamas’s first targets on 7 October. Sixty-two people from the kibbutz were killed by Hamas. Of the 19 hostages taken from there into Gaza, two were killed by Israeli troops after they escaped from captivity. Five hostages from Kfar Aza are still in Gaza. The Israeli army took journalists into Kfar Aza on 10 October last year, when it was still a battle zone. We saw Israeli combat troops dug into the fields around the kibbutz and could hear gunfire as they cleared buildings where they suspected Hamas fighters might be sheltering. Israeli civilians killed by Hamas were being carried out in body bags from the ruins of their homes. Hamas fighters killed by Israeli soldiers as they fought their way into the kibbutz still lay on the neat lawns, turning black as they decomposed in the strong Mediterranean sun. A year later the dead are buried but very little has changed. The living have not returned to live in their homes. Ruined houses have been preserved as they were when I saw them on 10 October last year, except the names and photos of the people who lived and were killed inside them are displayed on big posters and memorials. Zohar Shpak, a resident who survived the attack with his family, showed us round the homes of neighbours who were not as lucky. One of the houses had a large photo on its wall of the young couple who lived there, both killed by Hamas on 7 October. The ground around the houses has been dug over. Zohar said the young man’s father had spent weeks sifting earth to try to find his son’s head. He had been buried without it. The stories of the dead of 7 October, and the hostages, are well known in Israel. Local media still talk about their country’s losses, adding new information to old pain. Zohar said it was too early to think about how they might rebuild their lives. “We are still inside the trauma. We are not in post-trauma. Like people said, we're still here. We are still in the war. We wanted the war will be ended, but we want it will be ended with a victory, but not an army victory. Not a war victory. “My victory is that I could live here, with my son and daughter, with my grandchildren and living peacefully. I believe in peace.” Zohar and many other Kfar Aza residents identified with the left wing of Israeli politics, meaning that they believed Israel’s only chance of peace was allowing the Palestinians their independence. Israelis like Zohar and his neighbours are convinced that Netanyahu is a disastrous prime minister who bears a heavy responsibility for leaving them vulnerable and open to attack on 7 October. But Zohar does not trust the Palestinians, people he used to ferry to hospitals in Israel in better times when they were allowed out of Gaza for medical treatment. “I don't believe those people who are living over there. But I want the peace. I want to go to Gaza's beach. But I don't trust them. No, I don't trust any one of them.” Hamas leaders do not accept that the attacks on Israel were a mistake that brought the wrath of Israel, armed and supported by the United States down on to the heads of their people. Blame the occupation, they say, and its lust for destruction and death. In Qatar, an hour or so before Iran attacked Israel on 1 October, I interviewed Khalil al-Hayya, the most senior Hamas leader outside Gaza, second only in their organisation to Yahya Sinwar. He denied his men had targeted civilians – despite overwhelming evidence – and justified the attacks by saying it was necessary to put the plight of the Palestinians on the world’s political agenda. “It was necessary to raise an alarm in the world to tell them that here there is a people who have a cause and have demands that must be met. It was a blow to Israel, the Zionist enemy.” Israel felt the blow, and on 7 October, as the IDF was rushing troops to the Gaza border, Benjamin Netanyahu made a speech promising a “mighty vengeance”. He set out war aims of eliminating Hamas as a military and political force and bringing the hostages home. The prime minister continues to insist that “total victory” is possible, and that force will in the end free the Israelis held by Hamas for a year. His political opponents, including relatives of the hostages, accuse him of blocking a ceasefire and a hostage deal to appease ultra-nationalists in his government. He is accused of putting his own political survival before the lives of Israelis. Netanyahu has many political enemies in Israel, even though the offensive in Lebanon has helped repair his poll numbers. He remains controversial but for most Israelis the war in Gaza is not. Since 7 October, most Israelis have hardened their hearts to the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Two days into the war, Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said he had ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed… We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” Since then, under international pressure, Israel has been forced to loosen its blockade. At the United Nations at the end of September, Netanyahu insisted Gazans have all the food they need. The evidence shows clearly that is not true. Days before his speech, UN humanitarian agencies signed a declaration just demanding an end to “appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”. ""More than 2 million Palestinians are without protection, food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care, education, electricity and fuel – the basic necessities to survive. Families have been forcibly displaced, time and time again, from one unsafe place to the next, with no way out."" BBC Verify has analysed the condition of Gaza after a year of war. The Hamas-run health ministry says nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed so far. Analysis of satellite imagery by US academics Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek suggests 58.7% of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. But there is another human cost - displacement - with civilians repeatedly instructed to move by the IDF. The effects of the movement of people can be seen from space. Satellite images show how tents have amassed and dispersed in central Rafah. It's a pattern that has been repeated across the strip. These waves of displacement began on 13 October, when the IDF told residents of the northern half of the strip to move south for their own ""safety"". BBC Verify has identified more than 130 social media posts like these shared by the IDF, detailing which areas were designated combat zones, routes to take out and where temporary pauses in fighting would take place. In total, these often-overlapping posts amounted to about 60 evacuation orders covering more than 80% of the Gaza strip. On many of the notices, BBC Verify has found key details to be unreadable and drawn boundaries inconsistent with the text. The IDF has designated a coastal area – al-Mawasi - in southern Gaza as a humanitarian zone. It still gets bombed. BBC Verify has analysed footage of 18 air strikes within the zone’s borders. ___ Satellite pictures show a huge bottleneck of people on Salah al-Din Street, after Israel ordered the effective depopulation of northern Gaza. Somewhere in the crowds moving down Salah al-Din, Gaza’s main north-south route, was Insaf Hassan Ali, her husband and two children, a boy of 11 and a girl of seven. So far, they have all survived, unlike many members of their extended family. Israel does not allow journalists into Gaza to report freely. We assume that is because Israel does not want us to see what it has done there. We commissioned a trusted Palestinian freelancer inside Gaza to interview Insaf Ali and her son. She spoke about the terrible fear they felt as they walked south, with perhaps one million others, on the orders of the Israeli army. Death was everywhere, she says. “We were walking on Salah al-Din Street. A car in front of us was hit. We saw it, and it was burning… On the left, people were killed, and on the right, even the animals—donkeys were thrown around, they were bombed. “We said, ‘That’s it, we’re done.’ We said, ‘now the rocket that is coming will be for us’.” Insaf and her family had a comfortable middle-class life before the war. Since then, they have been displaced 15 times on the orders of Israel. Like millions of others, they are destitute, often hungry, living in a tent at al-Mawasi, a desolate area of sand dunes. Snakes, scorpions and venomous giant worms invade the tents and have to be swept out. As well as the risk of death in an air strike, they face hunger, disease and the faecal dust generated when millions of people do not have access to proper sanitation. Insaf wept for her old life, and the people they have lost. “Our lives were beautiful, and suddenly we had nothing—no clothes, no food, no essentials for life.  Constantly being displaced is incredibly hard on my children's health. They’ve had malnutrition and they have been infected with diseases, including amoebic dysentery and hepatitis.” Insaf said that the beginning of months of Israeli bombing felt like the “horrors of judgement day”. “Any mother would feel the same, anyone who owns something precious and is afraid it might slip from their hands at any moment. Each time we moved to a house, it would be bombed, and someone in our family would be killed.” The only chance of making even small improvements in the lives of Insaf and her family and well over two million others in Gaza is to agree a ceasefire. If the killing stops, diplomats might have a window to stop the slide into a much wider catastrophe. More disasters await in the future, if the war drags on and a new generation of Israelis and Palestinians cannot shake the hatred and horror many currently feel about the actions of the other side. Insaf’s 11-year-old son, Anas Awad, has been deeply affected by everything he has seen. “There’s no future for Gaza’s children. The friends I used to play with have been martyred. We used to run around together. May God have mercy on them. The mosque where I used to memorise the Quran has been bombed. My school has been bombed. So has the playground… everything has gone. I want peace. I wish I could return with my friends and play again. I wish we had a house, not a tent.” “I don’t have friends anymore. Our whole life has turned to sand. When I go out to the prayer area, I feel anxious, and hesitant. I don’t feel right.” His mother was listening. “It has been the hardest year of my life. We saw sights we should not have seen – scattered bodies, the desperation of a grown man holding a bottle of water to drink for his children. Of course, our homes are no longer homes; they are just piles of sand, but we hope for the day when we can return.’ UN humanitarian agencies have condemned both Israel and Hamas: “The parties’ conduct over the last year makes a mockery of their claim to adhere to international humanitarian law and the minimum standards of humanity that it demands.”   Both sides deny accusations they have broken the laws of war.  Hamas claims it ordered its men not to kill Israeli civilians. Israel says it warns Palestinian civilians to get out of harm’s way but Hamas uses them as human shields. Israel has been referred to the International Court of Justice, accused by South Africa of genocide. The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court has applied for arrest warrants on a range of war crimes charges for Yahya Sinwar of Hamas, and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. For Israelis the Hamas attacks on 7 October were a painful reminder of centuries of pogroms against Jews in Europe that culminated in the genocide carried out by Nazi Germany. In the first month of the war, the Israeli writer and former politician Avraham Burg explained the profound psychological impact on his country. “We, the Jews,” he told me, “we believe that the state of Israel is the first and best immune system and protective system versus Jewish history. No more pogroms, no more Holocaust, no more mass murderers. And all of a sudden, all of it is back.” Ghosts of the past tormented Palestinians as well. Raja Shehadeh, the celebrated Palestinian writer and human rights campaigner believes that Israel wanted to make another Nakba – another catastrophe: in his latest book What Does Israel Fear From Palestine? he writes “as the war progressed I could see that they meant every word and did not care about civilians, including children. In their eyes, as well as the eyes of most Israelis, all Gazans were guilty”. No one can doubt Israel’s determination to defend its people, helped enormously by the might of the United States. It is clear though, that the war has shown that nobody can fool themselves that Palestinians will accept lives lived forever under an Israeli military occupation, without proper civil rights, freedom of movement and independence. After generations of conflict Israelis and Palestinians are used to confronting each other. But they are also used to living alongside each other, however uncomfortably. When a ceasefire comes, and with a new generation of leaders, there will be chances to push again for peace. But that is a more distant future. The rest of the year and into 2025, with a new president in the White House, are uncertain and full of danger. For months after Hamas attacked Israel, the fear was that the war would spread, and get worse. Slowly, and then very quickly, it happened, after Israel’s devastating attacks on Hezbollah and Lebanon. It is too late to say the Middle East is on the brink. Israel is facing off against Iran.  The warring parties have plunged over it, and countries not yet directly involved are desperate not to be dragged over the edge. As I write Israel has still not retaliated for Iran’s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. It has indicated that it intends to inflict a severe punishment. President Biden and his administration, Israel’s constant supplier of weapons and diplomatic support, are trying to calibrate a response that might offer Iran a way to stop the accelerating climb up the ladder of escalation, a phrase strategists use to describe the way wars speed from crisis to disaster. The proximity of the US elections, along with Joe Biden’s steadfast support for Israel, despite his misgivings about the way it has been fighting, do not induce much optimism that the US will somehow finesse a way out. The signals from Israel indicate that Netanyahu, Gallant, the generals of the IDF and the intelligence agencies believe they have the upper hand. October 7th was a disaster for them. All the major security and military chiefs, except the prime minister, apologised and some resigned. They had not planned for a war with Hamas. But planning for the war with Hezbollah started after the last one ended in 2006 in a humiliating stalemate for Israel. Hezbollah has suffered blows from which it might never recover. So far Israel’s victories are tactical. To get to a strategic victory it would need to coerce its enemies into changing their behaviour. Hezbollah, even in its reduced state, is showing that it wants to fight on. Taking on Israeli infantry and tanks now that south Lebanon has once more been invaded might negate some of Israel’s advantages in air power and intelligence. If Iran answers Israel’s retaliation with another wave of ballistic missiles other countries might get pulled in. In Iraq, Iran’s client militias could attack American interests. Two Israeli soldiers were killed by a drone that came from Iraq. Saudi Arabia is also looking on nervously. Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman has made clear his view of the future. He would contemplate recognising Israel, but only if the Palestinians get a state in return and Saudi Arabia gets a security pact with the United States. Joe Biden’s role, simultaneously trying to restrain Israel while supporting it with weapons, diplomacy and carrier strike groups, exposes the Americans to getting involved in a wider war with Iran. They don’t want that to happen, but Biden has pledged that he will come to Israel’s aid if it becomes necessary. Israel’s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, and the damage done to Iran’s strategy and its “axis of resistance” is fostering a new set of illusions among some in Israel and the United States. The dangerous idea is that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the Middle East by force, imposing order and neutering Israel’s enemies. Joe Biden – and his successor – should be wary of that. The last time that restructuring the Middle East by force was contemplated seriously was after al-Qaeda’s 9/11 attacks on America, when US President George W Bush and Tony Blair, the UK’s prime minister, were getting ready to invade Iraq in 2003. The invasion of Iraq did not purge the Middle East of violent extremism. It made matters worse. The priority for those who want to stop this war should be a ceasefire in Gaza. It is the only chance to cool matters and to create a space for diplomacy. This year of war started in Gaza. Perhaps it can end there too.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6wjdjn0g7o,"Rwanda plan was un-British, says ex-PM John Major",The former Tory leader criticises the previous government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has criticised the previous government's Rwanda asylum plan, branding it ""un-Conservative and un-British"".  The scheme aimed to deter people crossing the Channel in small boats by sending some migrants who arrived in the UK illegally to the east African country.  However, the plan was stalled by legal challenges and scrapped by the new Labour government, with no migrants sent to Rwanda under the scheme.  In an interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan, Sir John, who was Tory PM from 1990 to 1997, said he thought the plan was ""odious"". ""I thought it was un-Conservative, un-British, if one dare say in a secular society, un-Christian, and unconscionable and I thought that this is really not the way to treat people,"" he said.  Challenged over whether the scheme was a necessary deterrent to stop small boat crossings, Sir John said: ""Are they seriously saying to me that somewhere in the backwoods of some North Africa country, they actually know what the British Parliament has legislated for? I think not."" He added: ""If it actually happened it might have been [a deterrent] - but it would still have been odious in my view."" In the wide-ranging interview, Sir John was also asked about his views on the future of the Conservative Party.  The former PM said he had not done many TV interviews recently because ""there’s not been a great deal I could say, I would wish to say, in favour of what the previous government were doing"".  He added: ""I thought it better just to stay off the air. Now, of course, the election's behind us, the party’s looking again to the future, and I can return to speaking out, hopefully in favour."" Asked if his party deserved to lose July's general election, when the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat in the party's parliamentary history, Sir John said ""there’s a time of when democracy needs a change in government"".  Sir John's government was also unseated by a Labour landslide in 1997, when Tony Blair won power.  ""I could see that in 1997, we had been in government for 18 years and it was perfectly true to say, that we were tired and that we were running out of fresh people to make ministers and reinject the government with vigour,"" he said.  ""And of course the same thing applies [with the recent election results], although it was only 14 years."" Sir John urged his party to appeal to the centre-right, ""where our natural support really lies"", arguing the Tories lost far more seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats than the right-wing Reform UK party.  ""We lost five [seats] to Reform UK and people are jumping up and down, and some, rather reckless people are saying, well we must merge with them. ""Well, that will be fatal."" However, Sir John said he was ""optimistic"" about the party's future, adding: ""We have had such a bad defeat, we have got a base upon which we can build, in a wholly new and, I think, potentially effective way."" Sir John said he had not decided who he was backing to be the next Tory leader, who will be announced on 2 November. But he added: ""I would like to support someone who's going to look at the long-term problems and make a suggestion as to which direction we should go and bring people back into the party who are genuinely centre-right."" The full interview, Amol Rajan Interviews: John Major, is on BBC Two at 19:00 BST and will be available on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds from 06:00."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yyr7283vo,Pressure on Secret Service as Biden says agency 'needs more help',Leaders of both parties have called for Donald Trump to receive the same level of protection as the sitting president.,16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Pressure is growing to increase Donald Trump's Secret Service protection after the second apparent assassination attempt on the former president in two months. ""The service needs more help,"" President Joe Biden said on Monday. ""Congress should respond to their needs if they in fact need more service people."" Ryan Routh faced federal gun charges at a hearing in Florida over the incident on Sunday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Investigators say Routh carried an SKS-style scoped rifle, was waiting near the course for 12 hours, and was within about 300-500 yards (275-460m) of Trump but never had a ""line of sight"".  Routh was arrested on an interstate highway around 45 minutes after a secret service agent spotted the muzzle of a rifle poking out of the bushes. He was laying in wait in bushes on ""public side of the fence"" around the sixth hole of the course, investigators say.  Authorities have charged Routh with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He will attend another next week to determine whether he should remain in custody. Trump told supporters that he was safe and well, and thanked the Secret Service - the government agency with responsibility for protecting the president and major US officials - and other law enforcement agencies for doing an ""incredible job"". Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said that Trump does not receive the same level of protection that a sitting president does. ""If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded,"" he said. On Monday, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said that Trump's golf outing was not planned in advance, and that agents were given little notice. Trump ""wasn't even really supposed to go there, it was not on his official schedule"", Mr Rowe noted. ""We put together a security plan, and that security plan worked,"" he said. He added that Mr Biden had approved ""increased assets"" for presidential candidates following the assassination attempt against Trump in July. The assets, which were in place for Trump on Sunday, included snipers, counter assault teams and drones. Mr Rowe said the ""footprint"" of Trump's security team now compared to when he was president. Several members of Congress, from both major parties, have said that presidential candidates should receive the same level of protection as the sitting president. Senator Tom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he would introduce legislation to get that. Representative Claudia Tenney of New York, a Republican, posted on Twitter/X that it was ""inexplicable"" that Trump could come close to a second attempt on his life. A number of Democrats also called for a review of security procedures. “Two assassination attempts in 60 days on a former President & the Republican nominee is unacceptable,” tweeted Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of the House from California.  The bipartisan congressional task force investigating the first assassination attempt against Trump had requested an additional briefing from the Secret Service after Sunday's incident. Former agents in the service have suggested to the BBC that Trump needs more protection than other former presidents, given that he is running for the White House. ""We now have to re-evaluate,"" said former agent Barry Donadio. ""Should all these candidates get the same presidential protective package? I think that's probably going to have to be the answer."" The assassination attempt in Pennsylvania in July led to the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle, the Secret Service chief who admitted that the agency had had its ""most significant operational failure"" in decades. In an interview with Fox News, Trump blamed President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris for the attack. ""He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" Trump told Fox News, without referencing any evidence. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at,"" he said, ""when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country - both from the inside and out."" Mr Biden said he was ""relieved"" that Trump was unharmed, adding : ""I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety."" Ms Harris said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the attempted assassination and that she was ""thankful that former President Trump is safe"". ""We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,"" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvdyd4nnzro,No new pledge on Ukraine missiles after Starmer-Biden talks,Ukraine has repeatedly urged the UK and US to let it fire long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has held ""productive"" talks with US President Joe Biden about Ukraine – but he did not signal any decision on allowing Kyiv to fire long-range missiles into Russia. Sir Keir said the talks in Washington concentrated on ""strategy"", rather than a ""particular step or tactic"". The White House said the pair had also expressed ""deep concern about Iran and North Korea's provision of lethal weapons to Russia"". Early on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had launched over 70 Iranian-made drones across Ukraine overnight, and that his country needed more air defence and long-range capabilities ""to protect life and our people"". ""We are working on this with all Ukrainian partners,"" he said. Ahead of the talks at the White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Western nations not to let Ukraine fire long-range missiles at Russia. Putin said such a move would represent Nato's ""direct participation"" in the Ukraine war.  But former UK defence secretary Sir Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Nato should let Ukraine fire long-range missiles in Russia in spite of Putin's threats, adding that wrangling was just benefiting the Russian president. ""I'm just disappointed that it's yet again another tug of war around another capability,"" the former Conservative MP said. Kurt Volker, former US special representative for Ukraine negotiations said Putin's comments were made to prevent further Western action. ""The reason Putin says those things is to achieve the result of deterring us from doing things - not that it has any bearing on what he's really going to do or really thinks,"" he told the Today programme. Commenting on the debate over long-range missiles, he said the US ""overplays the sense that this is a new red line that this would be so provocative to Russia that it would create some kind of new escalation"". Addressing reporters ahead of his meeting with Sir Keir at the White House, Biden said: ""I don't think much about Vladimir Putin.""  To date, the US and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia, for fear of escalation. However, Zelensky has repeatedly called on Kyiv's Western allies to authorise such use, saying it is the only way to bring about an end to the war. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under daily bombardment from Russia.  Many of the missiles and glide bombs that hit Ukraine's military positions, blocks of flats, energy facilities and hospitals are launched by Russian aircraft deep inside Russia. Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself. The UK previously said Ukraine had a ""clear right"" to use British-provided weapons for ""self-defence"" which ""does not preclude operations inside Russia"", following Kyiv's surprise cross-border incursion last month. However, this excludes the use of long-range Storm Shadow missiles in territory outside Ukraine's internationally recognised borders. The US provided long-range missiles to Ukraine earlier this year, but like Kyiv's other Western allies these have not been authorised for use on targets deep inside Russia. Asked if he was intimidated by Putin's threats of a potential war with Nato, Sir Keir said ""the quickest way to resolve"" the war in Ukraine ""lies through what Putin actually does"". Sir Keir said the White House meeting with Biden was an opportunity to discuss the strategy in relation to Ukraine, ""not just a particular step or tactic"".  The pair also discussed the situation in the Middle East, where the Israel-Gaza war has been raging for nearly a year, and ""other areas across the world"", Sir Keir added. He told reporters they would get another opportunity to discuss these issues at the United Nations General Assembly next week.  In a separate briefing on Friday, ahead of the two leaders' meeting, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington was not planning any change in the limits it has placed on Ukraine's use of US-made weapons to hit Russian territory. Earlier on Friday, Moscow expelled six British diplomats, revoking their accreditation and accusing them of spying.  The country's security service, the FSB, said in a statement it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia. The accusations were dismissed by the UK Foreign Office as ""completely baseless"". In an interview with the BBC, UK defence analyst Justin Crump said Putin was testing the new Labour government and the outgoing Biden administration.  ""Ultimately Russia already supplies weapons to the UK's adversaries, and is already engaged in 'active measures' such as subversion, espionage, sabotage, and information/cyber operations against Nato members' interests. ""This may all accelerate, but picking a fight against all of Nato is not something Russia can afford given how hard they're struggling against just Ukraine,"" Mr Crump added.  Also on Friday, the US announced new sanctions against the Russian media channel RT, accusing it of being a ""de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus"". The top US diplomat, Antony Blinken, told reporters RT is part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets, which have sought to covertly ""undermine democracy in the United States"". In response to US allegations that RT had sought to influence elections, the broadcaster's editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan - who was sanctioned by the US last week - said they were excellent teachers, adding that many RT staff had studied in the US, and with US funding. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said there should be a ""new profession"" in the US, of specialist in sanctions imposed on Russia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2kqqzx75wo,Republicans absorb a political shockwave in must-win North Carolina,Scandalous claims about a Trump-endorsed candidate for governor generate turbulence on the campaign trial.,21 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Controversy swirling around a North Carolina Republican candidate for governor is causing political turbulence in a must-win swing state for Donald Trump. The BBC asked conservatives there what they make of the alleged scandal. It was during a regular meeting of the Johnston County Republican Women’s committee that they heard the news. All around North Carolina on Thursday, Republicans and Democrats alike had been waiting for what was billed as a bombshell exposé about Republican Lt Gov Mark Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump. The furniture maker-turned-politician, who is running to be the state’s first black governor, had called himself a “black Nazi” on a porn website more than a decade ago, according to a report by CNN. Robinson, who identifies as an evangelical Christian, branded the report ""tabloid lies"". The BBC has not independently verified CNN’s claims. But when the news finally did break, it barely caused a stir, at least not among this polite gathering of women in Johnston County. “If the accusations are accurate, it’s something for him and his wife to deal with. It’s not my business. It’s a marital issue,” said Adele Walker, 52. Soon afterwards, the group discussed their planned $200 donation to his campaign, in which he is already trailing the Democratic candidate Josh Stein, the state's attorney general. “What we decided is that we’re going to donate even more money to Mr Robinson,” she said. The opinions of conservative women like Walker are being closely watched this election, not just in North Carolina, but across the US. The Tar Heel State has one of the closest races in the country with November's election looming. Trump had previously offered a glowing endorsement of Robinson, calling him ""Martin Luther King on steroids"".  Even before the CNN exposé was published, Robinson was under scrutiny.  He has faced backlash over 2019 comments in a Facebook video about abortion on demand, when he said women should be ""responsible enough to keep your skirt down"".  In 2021, he said children in schools should not be learning about ""transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth"", and later rejected calls to apologise.  “I think it's fair to call the Robinson campaign a dumpster fire at this point,” said North Carolina State University political scientist Steven Greene. There are fears among some Republicans that Robinson could be a political albatross, causing their voters to stay home, or driving Democratic turnout. North Carolina has remained “stubbornly Republican”, said Greene. Barack Obama was the only Democrat to win the state in 44 years, and he could only succeed once, in 2008. But the state’s growing urban centres have tilted the political scales towards Democrats, who hope this is the year they can turn North Carolina blue.  An Emerson College Polling/The Hill survey released on Thursday, before the CNN report about Robinson was published, showed Harris leading Trump by one percentage point.  That is still well within the margin of error, which means the race is very much up in the air. This state is essential for the Republican White House candidate, Greene said. “It's a lot harder to see Donald Trump getting to 270 without North Carolina than Kamala Harris,” he said, referring to the number of electoral college votes needed to clinch the US presidency. Scott Lassiter, a Republican running for state Senate, expressed disappointment that Robinson did not drop out before a state deadline on Thursday, allowing another candidate from the party to take his place. Lassiter said Robinson is a gift to Democrats, who “would love for every race on the ballot to be about Mark Robinson at this point”. Once a regular at Trump’s campaign events in the state, Robinson will not attend the former president’s rally in Wilmington on Saturday, according to reports. But those close to Robinson are sticking by him. Guilford County chairman Chris Meadows, a Republican, said he’s known Robinson, who's from the area, for years. “Our position is that these are unsubstantiated allegations, accusations,"" he said.  “In the age of the improvement of AI, I really don’t put any credibility in any of this until he admits it.  ""CNN has a great deal of credibility problems and they have for several years.” In the end, Greene said the presidential race will all come down to voter turnout, and it’s unclear how Robinson will affect that. He was already known for outlandish statements. People’s minds are probably largely made up, he said. It certainly seemed that way in Johnston County. One Republican voter, who did not want to be named, said he would not vote for Robinson, who he said “had a loud mouth”. But he has no problem voting for Trump. “I don’t know what Trump knew about Robinson. The news of Robinson has no effect on me,” he said. Evelyn Costelloe, 66, who has voted for Republicans in the past but not recently, said she will back the Democrats because of their stance on abortion. And Robinson’s comments didn’t help either, she said. “I don’t know about all these accusations, but I do know the stuff he’s said. Stuff like that makes me want to vote for sure,” she told the BBC. Given that Trump only won North Carolina by about 75,000 votes in 2020, even a little bit of political damage spilling over from Robinson could make a difference. For now, however, North Carolina remains a deep shade of purple. North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjv3gdxv7go,"Eating pets, inflation, abortion - key debate claims fact-checked",BBC Verify has been examining Trump and Harris's claims in their first head-to-head debate in the US election campaign.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris went head to head in their first televised debate in the US election campaign. In 90 minutes of often fiery exchanges, the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates traded claims over key election issues including the economy, immigration and abortion. BBC Verify has been examining them. CLAIM: Trump: “In Springfield, they’re [immigrants] eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats, they’re eating the pets of people that live there”. VERDICT: There is no evidence that this is happening.  Trump's comment followed a baseless claim - which was shared by his vice-presidential candidate JD Vance - that immigrants from Haiti who have recently settled in Springfield, Ohio, have been eating pets. Springfield city officials told BBC Verify: “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” You can read more here. CLAIM: Harris: “Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression”. VERDICT: This is false.  At the end of Trump’s term of office in January 2021, the unemployment rate was 6.4%. But it has been higher since the Great Depression. In October 2009, unemployment peaked at 10% in a period of deep economic recession.  It has fallen steadily since, apart from a sharp peak during the Covid pandemic, and in the most recent data for August 2024, unemployment stood at 4.2%. CLAIM: Trump: “We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums”. VERDICT: There is no evidence for these kind of numbers. There have been about 10 million encounters with migrants crossing over the US border since January 2021.  There are no publicly available figures on how many of them have served time in prison or come from mental institutions but there is some data on how many have previous criminal convictions. Of the 1.4 million apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally so far this financial year (to September 2024) - and where the Border Patrol was able to check against law enforcement databases - about 14,700 people had previous criminal convictions. That's equivalent to roughly 1% of all border apprehensions in this period and doesn’t amount to the “millions” Trump is claiming. CLAIM: Harris: ""If Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban"". VERDICT: This is misleading. Trump has denied that he would sign a national ban if elected president.  He has said that he would leave limits on abortion access up to individual states to decide. Here, Harris also talked about ""his Project 2025"" - a reference to a document published by the right-wing Heritage Foundation outlining a list of policy proposals that they believe a Trump presidency should implement. It doesn’t propose a national ban either, but it does recommend limiting abortion access. Trump has distanced himself from the document, saying: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.” Many former Trump administration officials are associated with Project 2025. CLAIM: Trump: “The worst inflation we've ever had"" [was under Biden].  VERDICT: This is false.  Under President Biden, inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, at a time when prices were rising sharply in many countries.  Inflation was last above 9% in 1981, but it has been significantly higher than that at several other points in US history. Since its peak in mid-2022, inflation has dropped to 2.9%, for the year to July 2024. But prices are still rising and it is a key issue for many voters. CLAIM: Harris: ""Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle class families in about $4,000 more a year"". VERDICT: Harris calls Trump's proposed tax on imports a sales tax. Some economists have estimated that these tariffs could cost families this much. Others have lower estimates.  Trump insists the cost would be felt by foreign countries but economists believe there would be an economic cost for US importers and consumers.  The $4,000 figure comes from analysis - by the left-of-centre think tank the Centre for American Progress - of Trump’s pledge to increase tariffs on all imported goods to 10-20% and all goods imported from China to 60%. They took the amount the US buys in goods from abroad annually, figured out how much the new taxes on these goods would be and divided this by the number of households in the US. It works out at $4,600 per household, but when you look at “middle income” families you get a figure of $3,900 a year. Other estimates are lower. The Peterson Institute thinks the impact would be closer to $1,700 a year (for tariffs at 10%) or $2,500 (at 20%). CLAIM: Trump: “Crime in Venezuela… is way down because they have taken their criminals off the streets and given them to her [Harris] to put into our country”. VERDICT: There is no evidence that Venezuela is doing this. Crime levels are down but experts say this is because of the state of the economy.  The Venezuelan government does not publish reliable crime figures, but the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Violence does. The Observatory’s 2023 annual report said that violent deaths that year - such as homicides - were down by a quarter compared to 2022. The Observatory told BBC Verify: ""Crime is reduced in Venezuela by a reduction in crime opportunities: bank robberies disappear because there is no money to steal; kidnappings are reduced because there is no cash to pay ransoms.” It said it had seen no evidence that the Venezuelan government was sending criminals to the US.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgvr9kgkqyo,China is part of the US election - but only from one candidate,There is a stark difference in how - and how often - each candidate addresses the US-China relationship.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US and China are the two largest economies in the world. They have the two most powerful militaries in the world. The US-China rivalry, in the view of many international analysts, will be the defining global theme of the 21st Century. But at the moment, only one of the two major party presidential candidates is regularly talking about US-China policy - as he has done consistently for years. According to a review by BBC Verify, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has mentioned China 40 times in his five rallies since the presidential debate earlier this month. In just one hour at a town hall forum last week in Michigan, he brought up the country 27 times. And when he talks about China, Trump focuses on matters of tension between the two global powers, painting the country and the world’s second-largest economy, as a kind of economic predator. He has talked about the new tariffs he plans to impose on imports from Chinese companies – and those from other nations -  should he return to the White House.  He has said he wants to prevent Chinese-made cars from being sold because he believes they will destroy the American auto industry. He has warned China not to attempt to replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And he has blamed the Chinese government for the Covid pandemic. Many economists question the effectiveness of Trump’s tariff plans and warn that they would ultimately be harmful to US consumers. The Biden-Harris administration, however, has maintained, and even at times increased, the more narrowly focused tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term in office. Trump’s protectionist message is tailored to blue-collar voters in the key industrial Midwest battleground states who have felt the impact of increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.  Meanwhile, BBC Verify finds, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris did not mention China at all in her six rallies since the 10 September debate. Although, in a speech on the economy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday afternoon, she made a handful of references to the country. “I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, communities, and companies,” she said at that event. Asked for comment, an aide to the vice-president told the BBC that even if Harris does not talk about China regularly, she has a record of working to counter what they described as China’s efforts to undermine global stability and prosperity. But when it comes to discussing China, the contrast between Trump and Harris on the campaign trail is unmistakable. On Monday afternoon, at a barn in Smithton, a small town in rural western Pennsylvania, Trump sat down with a group of local farmers and ranchers for a roundtable discussion specifically about China. The town may be just an hour outside of Pittsburgh, a Democratic Party urban stronghold, but this was decidedly Republican territory. Cows grazed peacefully on grasslands lined with dozens of “Trump for President signs”, while Trump supporters decorated two donkeys in “Make America Great Again” gear. The topic of the event, hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, a conservative think-tank, was “the Chinese Communist Party's growing threat to the US food supply”. The forum ended up being a more open-ended conversation about the threat of China, full stop. The farmers, ranchers and business executives on the panel complained about having to compete with heavily subsidised Chinese imports and about the low quality of Chinese goods. While the former president didn’t spend much time discussing the perceived dangers of Chinese ownership of US farmland – he instead promised that he would convince Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy more US agriculture exports – he again emphasised that he would use tariffs to shield the American economy from China. At one point, he spoke of the need to protect the US steel industry - in order to prepare for a hypothetical war with China. “If we’re in a war, and we need army tanks and we need ships and we need other things that happen to be made of steel, what are we going to do, go to China and get the steel?” he asked. “We’re fighting China, but would you mind selling us some steel?” Some of the heavier lifting on China during the forum was left to Richard Grenell, a roundtable panelist and senior advisor for the Protecting America Initiative. He warned the country has “quietly but strategically” worked against the US – particularly when Americans were distracted by other global issues. “They go after our local and state politicians; they go after our manufacturing,” he said. “There is no question they are looking to, at some point, leverage that investment and activity.” Grenell, who served as US ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence while Trump was in office, is considered a possible secretary of state - America’s top diplomat - if Trump wins another term in November. If Harris wins, on the other hand, there may not be a significant change from the current Biden administration, even if the current president has frequently deployed sharper rhetoric to describe the US-China rivalry. Since the start of his presidency, Joe Biden has identified China as one of the autocracies competing with the world’s leading democracies in what he describes as a historic global inflection point. According to public opinion surveys, China ranks low on the list of issues American voters care about – dwarfed by the economy, immigration and healthcare.  In a recent National Security Action survey of voters in key electoral battleground states, only 14% listed China as the top national security priority for the next president. Immigration led the list at 38%, followed by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, both at 28%. That could in part explain Harris’s seeming lack of interest in talking about China. In this abbreviated presidential campaign for her, she has a shorter timeframe to define herself in the eyes of voters, so focusing on America's main economic competitor may be less of a priority for the Democrat.  After the Trump event in Smithton, Bill Bretz, chair of the local county Republican Party committee, said that while China may not be at the top of voter concerns in Pennsylvania, it was important for Trump to talk about it. As the largest up-for-grabs electoral prize, Pennsylvania is perhaps the pivotal state in the 2024 presidential election. Both Trump and Harris will be hard-pressed to win the White House without it in their column. Polls currently show the two candidates in a dead heat there. “The majority of people have already picked the camp that they're in, but there are those group of people that are undecided,” he said. “If China is a straw that sways the scale one way or another, I think it's a great thing to bring up.” Additional reporting by Jake Horton and BBC Verify North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjyj2rd1zpo,China spent millions on this new trade route - then a war got in the way,"The BBC visits the border with Myanmar, where a war is raging on China’s doorstep.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"“One village, two countries” used to be the tagline for Yinjing on China’s south-western edge. An old tourist sign boasts of a border with Myanmar made of just “bamboo fences, ditches and earth ridges” - a sign of the easy economic relationship Beijing had sought to build with its neighbour. Now the border the BBC visited is marked by a high, metal fence running through the county of Ruili in Yunnan province. Topped by barbed wire and surveillance cameras in some places, it cuts through rice fields and carves up once-adjoined streets. China’s tough pandemic lockdowns forced the separation initially. But it has since been cemented by the intractable civil war in Myanmar, triggered by a bloody coup in 2021. The military regime is now fighting for control in large swathes of the country, including Shan State along China’s border, where it has suffered some of its biggest losses. The crisis at its doorstep - a nearly 2,000km (1,240-mile) border - is becoming costly for China, which has invested millions of dollars in Myanmar for a critical trade corridor.  The ambitious plan aims to connect China’s landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar. But the corridor has become a battleground between Myanmar rebels and the country's army. Beijing has sway over both sides but the ceasefire it brokered in January fell apart. It has now turned to military exercises along the border and stern words. Foreign Minister Wang Yi was the latest diplomat to visit Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw and is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing. Conflict is not new to impoverished Shan State. Myanmar’s biggest state is a major source of the world’s opium and and methamphetamine, and home to ethnic armies long opposed to centralised rule.  But the vibrant economic zones created by Chinese investment managed to thrive - until the civil war. A loudspeaker now warns people in Ruili not to get too close to the fence - but that doesn’t stop a Chinese tourist from sticking his arm between the bars of a gate to take a selfie. Two girls in Disney T-shirts shout through the bars - “hey grandpa, hello, look over here!” - as they lick pink scoops of ice cream. The elderly man shuffling barefoot on the other side barely looks up before he turns away. “Burmese people live like dogs,” says Li Mianzhen. Her corner stall sells food and drinks from Myanmar - like milk tea - in a small market just steps from the border checkpoint in Ruili city. Li, who looks to be in her 60s, used to sell Chinese clothes across the border in Muse, a major source of trade with China. But she says almost no-one in her town has enough money any more. Myanmar’s military junta still controls the town, one of its last remaining holdouts in Shan State. But rebel forces have taken other border crossings and a key trading zone on the road to Muse. The situation has made people desperate, Li says. She knows of some who have crossed the border to earn as little as 10 yuan - about one pound and not much more than a dollar - so that they can go back to Myanmar and “feed their families”. The war has severely restricted travel in and out of Myanmar, and most accounts now come from those who have fled or have found ways to move across the borders, such as Li. Unable to get the work passes that would allow them into China, Li’s family is stuck in Mandalay, as rebel forces edge closer to Myanmar’s second-largest city. “I feel like I am dying from anxiety,” Li says. “This war has brought us so much misfortune. At what point will all of this end?"" Thirty-one-year-old Zin Aung (name changed) is among those who made it out. He works in an industrial park on the outskirts of Ruili, which produces clothes, electronics and vehicle parts that are shipped across the world. Workers like him are recruited in large numbers from Myanmar and flown here by Chinese government-backed firms eager for cheap labour. Estimates suggest they earn about 2,400 yuan ($450; £340) a month, which is less than their Chinese colleagues. “There is nothing for us to do in Myanmar because of the war,” Zin Aung says. “Everything is expensive. Rice, cooking oil. Intensive fighting is going on everywhere. Everyone has to run.” His parents are too old to run, so he did. He sends home money whenever he can. The men live and work on the few square kilometres of the government-run compound in Ruili. Zin Aung says it is a sanctuary, compared with what they left behind: “The situation in Myanmar is not good, so we are taking refuge here.” He also escaped compulsory conscription, which the Myanmar army has been enforcing to make up for defections and battlefield losses. As the sky turned scarlet one evening, Zin Aung ran barefoot through the cloying mud onto a monsoon-soaked pitch, ready for a different kind of battle - a fiercely fought game of football. Burmese, Chinese and the local Yunnan dialect mingled as vocal spectators reacted to every pass, kick and shot. The agony over a missed goal was unmistakable. This is a daily affair in their new, temporary home, a release after a 12-hour shift on the assembly line. Many of the workers are from Lashio, the largest town in Shan State, and Laukkaing, home to junta-backed crime families - Laukkaing fell to rebel forces in January and Lashio was encircled, in a campaign which has changed the course of the war and China’s stake in it. Both towns lie along China’s prized trade corridor and the Beijing-brokered ceasefire left Lashio in the hands of the junta. But in recent weeks rebel forces have pushed into the town - their biggest victory to date. The military has responded with bombing raids and drone attacks, restricting internet and mobile phone networks. “The fall of Lashio is one of the most humiliating defeats in the military’s history,” says Richard Horsey, Myanmar adviser to the International Crisis Group. “The only reason the rebel groups didn’t push into Muse is they likely feared it would upset China,” Mr Horsey says. “Fighting there would have impacted investments China has hoped to restart for months. The regime has lost control of almost all northern Shan state – with the exception of Muse region, which is right next to Ruili.” Ruili and Muse, both designated as special trade zones, are crucial to the Beijing-funded 1,700km trade route, known as the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. The route also supports Chinese investments in energy, infrastructure and rare earth mining critical for manufacturing electric vehicles. But at its heart is a railway line that will connect Kunming - the capital of Yunnan province - to Kyaukphyu, a deep sea port the Chinese are building on Myanmar’s western coast. The port, along the Bay of Bengal, would give industries in and beyond Ruili access to the Indian Ocean and then global markets. The port is also the starting point for oil and gas pipelines that will transport energy via Myanmar to Yunnan. But these plans are now in jeopardy. President Xi Jinping had spent years cultivating ties with his resource-rich neighbour when the country’s elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was forced from power. Mr Xi refused to condemn the coup and continued to sell the army weapons. But he also did not recognise Min Aung Hlaing as head of state, nor has he invited him to China. Three years on, the war has killed thousands and displaced millions, but no end is in sight. Forced to fight on new fronts, the army has since lost between half and two-thirds of Myanmar to a splintered opposition. Beijing is at an impasse. It “doesn’t like this situation” and sees Myanmar’s military ruler Min Aung Hlaing as “incompetent”, Mr Horsey says. “They are pushing for elections, not because they necessarily want a return to democratic rule, but more because they think this is a way back.” Myanmar’s regime suspects Beijing of playing both sides - keeping up the appearance of supporting the junta while continuing to maintain a relationship with ethnic armies in Shan State. Analysts note that many of the rebel groups are using Chinese weapons. The latest battles are also a resurgence of last year’s campaign launched by three ethnic groups which called themselves the Brotherhood Alliance. It is thought that the alliance would not have made its move without Beijing’s tacit approval. Its gains on the battlefield spelled the end for notorious mafia families whose scam centres had trapped thousands of Chinese workers. Long frustrated over the increasing lawlessness along its border, Beijing welcomed their downfall - and the tens of thousands of suspects who were handed over by the rebel forces. For Beijing the worst-case scenario is the civil war dragging on for years. But it would also fear a collapse of the military regime, which might herald further chaos. How China will react to either scenario is not yet clear - what is also unclear is what more Beijing can do beyond pressuring both sides to agree to peace talks. That predicament is evident in Ruili with its miles of shuttered shops. A city that once benefited from its location along the border is now feeling the fallout from its proximity to Myanmar. Battered by some of China’s strictest lockdowns, businesses here took another hit when cross-border traffic and trade did not revive. They also rely on labour from the other side, which has stopped, according to several agents who help Burmese workers find jobs. They say China has tightened its restrictions on hiring workers from across the border, and has also sent back hundreds who were said to be working illegally. The owner of a small factory, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC that the deportations meant “his business isn’t going anywhere… and there’s nothing I can change”. The square next to the checkpoint is full of young workers, including mothers with their babies, waiting in the shade. They lay out their paperwork to make sure they have what they need to secure a job. The successful ones are given a pass which allows them to work for up to a week, or come and go between the two countries, like Li. “I hope some good people can tell all sides to stop fighting,” Li says. “If there is no-one in the world speaking up for us, it is really tragic.” She says she is often assured by those around her that fighting won’t break out too close to China. But she is unconvinced: “No-one can predict the future.” For now, Ruili is a safer option for her and Zin Aung. They understand that their future is in Chinese hands, as do the Chinese. “Your country is at war,” a Chinese tourist tells a Myanmar jade seller he is haggling with at the market. “You just take what I give you.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj35kk42k5vo,Ohio leaders dismiss claims of migrants eating pets,"Governor Mike DeWine defended Haitians in the town of Springfield as people who ""work very, very hard"".",12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Leaders in the US state of Ohio are trying to douse baseless claims that Haitian immigrants in a town there have been eating residents' pets as food. The allegations carried in right-wing media were amplified by Donald Trump at his presidential debate with Kamala Harris on Tuesday.  ""This is something that came up on the internet, and the internet can be quite crazy sometimes,"" Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said on Thursday. Trump repeated the false claims again at a rally in Arizona soon after. On Tuesday, a parent in the town of Springfield accused Republicans of politically exploiting his son's death in a crash caused by a Haitian migrant. Authorities say some 15,000 migrants of Haitian origin have resettled over the past couple of years in Springfield, a south-western Ohio town with a population of less than 60,000 people. Some local residents have expressed frustration over the influx, saying the newcomers are straining city resources, from housing to healthcare. In recent weeks unsubstantiated claims have surfaced on social media that the migrants are abducting and eating animals, from pet cats and dogs to park ducks. Trump, his running mate JD Vance, the world's richest man Elon Musk and other conservatives have amplified the reports. But Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said on Tuesday that ""we have not been able to verify any credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community"". ""The news story regarding a cat being killed or consumed did not originate in Springfield,"" he added. ""It actually involved a Canton woman who was arrested for animal cruelty last month."" Canton is an Ohio city north-east of Springfield. ""I think we go with what the mayor says,"" Governor DeWine told CBS on Wednesday. ""He knows his city."" A moderate Republican who has endorsed Trump's re-election bid, DeWine has pledged to invest in Springfield's healthcare and education systems to address its ""unprecedented"" population increase, but he also defended the newcomers. ""These Haitians came in here to work because there were jobs, and they filled a lot of jobs. And if you talk to employers, they've done a very, very good job and they work very, very hard,"" he said. On Thursday Springfield officials evacuated city hall following reports of a bomb threat. It is not yet known whether the incident was connected to the immigration controversy. The latest rebuttal comes after a Springfield father told Trump to stop using his son's death in a school bus crash, caused by a Haitian immigrant, for ""political gain"". Hermano Joseph was jailed for involuntary manslaughter and felony homicide after crashing into the bus in August 2023, killing Aiden Clark, 11. On Monday, the Trump campaign used Aiden's picture in a social media post attacking his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. On Tuesday, Trump's running mate JD Vance referred to Aiden in a post on Twitter/X, saying that ""a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant"". Aiden's father, Nathan, said in a city commission meeting later the same day that the message had reopened wounds: ""They have spoken my son's name and used his death for political gain. This needs to stop now."" Mr Clark said he wished his child had been killed ""by a 60-year-old white man"" so ""the incessant group of hate-spewing people would leave us alone"". ""My son was not murdered. He was accidentally killed by an immigrant from Haiti,"" he continued. ""They can vomit all the hate they want about illegal immigrants, the border crisis, and even untrue claims about fluffy pets being ravaged and eaten by community members,"" Mr Clark said on Tuesday. ""However, they are not allowed, nor have they ever been allowed to mention Aiden Clark from Springfield, Ohio."" The Trump campaign told the BBC it was ""deeply sorry to the Clark family for the loss of their son"".  ""We hope the media will continue to cover the stories of the very real suffering and tragedies experienced by the people of Springfield, Ohio, due to the influx of illegal Haitian immigrants in their community,"" the campaign said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ng0nyj2no,Rise of far right in Germany’s east isn’t over yet,"AfD support continues to rise in Germany, driven by anger over immigration and weapons for Ukraine.",8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"“If the old parties had done their jobs properly then the AfD would not exist,” Ingolf complains, echoing a common sense that the rest of Germany looks down on so-called “Ossis” in the east. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have already won the most votes in regional elections this month in the eastern state of Thuringia. Now Germany’s bracing for a further political shockwave, as polls suggest the AfD could also take the most votes in Brandenburg state's election in a few weeks time. Tucked away near the Polish border, in the two tiny villages of Jämlitz and Klein Düben, support for the far right has soared. A former conservative (CDU) voter, Ingolf is frustrated about how successive governments have handled education, saying standards were better when he was a boy growing up in the communist German Democratic Republic. He voices anxiety about Germany’s flatlining economy as well as immigration, comparing the far-right riots in England this summer to “civil war-like conditions”. Disorder that, while nothing like a civil war, has stoked narratives about the potential for violent clashes within multicultural communities. “That’s not what we want here in Germany,” he says. In Jämlitz, most notable for a large goose farm, the idea of civil strife couldn’t feel further away. Nor could the war raging in Ukraine. But the AfD’s call to stop sending weapons to Kyiv is also resonating strongly. “The money for Ukraine is an issue,” says Yvonne, who sees all war as “senseless” as we chat to her just down the road. “And this is our tax money that is sent abroad. We have enough things to fix in our own country.” However, Yvonne is leaning towards another anti-establishment party launched only this year that also opposes supplying arms to Ukraine and which is a surging force in German politics: the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). Ms Wagenknecht’s personal brand of “left-wing conservatism” has already propelled her party this month into the potential role of kingmaker in Saxony and Thuringia. However, for her critics, she has simply fashioned another unwelcome populist, pro-Putin movement that’s actively undermining central pillars of German foreign policy. I challenge Yvonne about the idea of ending arms supplies to Ukraine, which could help Russia win a war it began, by invading its neighbour. “I can understand both sides,” she says after a little hesitation. This is the part of Germany where the older generation, from the GDR years, grew up learning Russian language and culture. It’s also a country, scarred by two World Wars, that retains a strong pacifist streak fed by fears the existing conflict could escalate. “Poland is not big,” Yvonne says, as she points out the Polish border is only a few miles away. “And we are then the first ones to go when the tanks come across.” In these two villages, that have a population of under 500 people, 57.5% of voters backed the far-right party in a recent local council election, the largest proportion in Brandenburg. Across the wider district, that number was 43.7%, also unusually high.  It comes ahead of a larger, state-parliament level vote on 22 September, where the AfD is leading the polls – after they already won the most votes in Thuringia and came a close second in Saxony on 1 September. In Thuringia, the AfD attracted 36% of the under-30s vote, say election researchers. Their relative strength in the east is despite the fact the party is viewed by many – and officially classed in three states – as right-wing extremist, a charge its supporters avidly reject. Even if the AfD does well in Brandenburg it likely won’t take power because – as elsewhere – other parties refuse to work with it. Not far away, I visit one of the beautiful lakes that have been transformed from their original purpose as open cast coal mines. As I wander around asking people if they want to talk about German politics, most, perhaps unsurprisingly, are not all that tempted. A woman called Katrin does agree to speak, although she doesn’t want her picture taken. Ushering us away from a small crowd sunbathing on the grass and a little beach, she lights a cigarette and is watchful as we wait to hear what she has to say. It feels like it’s going to be really controversial. She doesn’t like the AfD – something that can feel like a rogue opinion around here. “Half the people here didn’t vote for the AfD,” she reminds us, adding she is “devastated” by local levels of support for a far-right party. But why are they so popular, I ask? “That’s a good question,” says Katrin. “That’s what I ask myself all the time.” “There is an old saying,” she recalls. “If a donkey is too comfortable it goes on black ice.” Katrin is saying that she believes life, actually, is relatively good for people in the community, leading to a misguided “grass-is-greener” syndrome - whether that’s with an eye on the past or present. Average wage levels and household wealth are lower in the east when compared to the west, although inequalities have narrowed through the years. Overall, Katrin doesn’t understand it. “I’m still thinking myself, why, why, why?” You get the feeling that mainstream parties, including those in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, are similarly unable to quite comprehend, or respond, to the success of either the AfD or BSW, parties polling nationally at about 18% and 8% respectively. The traditional parties of power are casting a nervous eye to the east and the Germany’s reputation for relatively calm, consensus politics is under strain."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjjqyv84eo,Polish city urged to evacuate as floods batter central Europe,"Several people have died across the Czech Republic, Austria, Romania and Poland following devastating floods.",17 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The mayor of a Polish city has asked all 44,000 residents to evacuate, as widespread flooding continues to batter central Europe. Nysa mayor Kordian Kolbiarz asked people to head for higher ground, citing the risk of an embankment breaching and releasing a cascade of water into the town from a nearby lake. The death toll from the floods that hit over the weekend rose to at least 16 on Monday, with seven confirmed fatalities in Romania. Casualties were also recorded in Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland. Budapest said it would close roads near the river Danube which runs through the Hungarian capital, citing the risk of flooding later this week.  “Please evacuate your belongings, yourselves, your loved ones. It is worth getting to the top floor of the building immediately, because the wave may be several metres high. This means that the whole town will be flooded,” Nysa Mayor Kolbiarz wrote.  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said one billion zloty (£197m) would be allocated for flood victims in the country, adding that Poland would also apply for EU relief funds. His government has also declared a state of natural disaster.  Although conditions have stabilised in some places, others are bracing themselves for more disruption and danger from the floods, sparked by Storm Boris. In Slovakia, the overflowing of the Danube River caused flooding in the Old Town area of the capital, Bratislava, with local media reporting that water levels exceeded 9m (30ft) and were expected to rise further. Hungary is bracing itself for floods in the coming days. Warnings are in force along 500km (310 miles) of the Danube.  The river is rising by about a metre every 24 hours, with Budapest's mayor offering residents a million sandbags to protect against floodwaters. Some tram lines will not operate, while roads along the river will be closed in the Hungarian capital from Monday evening. Trains between Budapest and Vienna have also been cancelled.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on X that he had postponed all his international obligations ""due to the extreme weather conditions and the ongoing floods in Hungary"".  The highest rainfall totals have been in the Czech Republic. In the north-eastern town of Jesenik, 473mm (19in) of rain has fallen since Thursday morning - five times the average monthly rainfall. The Czech fire service delivered bottles of drinking water to stranded villages, where people were told not to drink water from their taps or their wells as it is likely heavily contaminated.  In the Austrian town of St Polten, more rain has fallen in four days than in the whole of the wettest autumn on record, in 1950.  Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the armed forces had been deployed to offer assistance to storm-hit regions. Austria's Climate Ministry said €300m (£253m) in recovery funds would be made available. Most parties paused campaigning for the federal elections due in less than two weeks, on 29 September. Villages and town were submerged in eastern Romania. Emil Dragomir, mayor of Slobozia Conachi, told media that the flooding had had a devastating impact. ""If you were here, you would cry instantly, because people are desperate, their whole lives' work is gone, there were people who were left with just the clothes they had on,"" he said. Thousands of people have been evacuted in Poland, including the personnel and patients of a hospital in the town of Nysa. Roads have been badly disrupted and train traffic was suspended in many parts of the country. On Monday morning, the mayor of Paczków in south-west Poland appealed to residents to evacuate after water began overflowing in a nearby reservoir, endangering the town.  In other parts of Poland, however, water levels are now falling, according to local officials. The mayor of Klodzko city, Michal Piszko, told Polish media the water had receded and the indications were the worst was now over. Video footage from Monday morning showed that city centre streets which were inundated on Sunday were now water-free, although the footage also revealed the extent of damage done to the buildings. More rain is expected throughout Monday and Tuesday in Austria, the Czech Republic and south-east Germany, where another 100mm could fall. While it may still take days for the flood waters to subside, the weather will improve in central Europe from mid-week with much drier conditions. Storm Boris will, however, now move further south into Italy, where it will reintensify and bring heavy rain. The Emilia-Romagna region is set to be worst hit, with 100-150mm of rain falling. The record rainfall seen in central Europe has been caused by a number of factors, including climate change. Different weather elements came together to create a “perfect storm” in which very cold air from the Arctic met warm air from the Mediterranean.  A pattern of atmospheric pressure also meant that Storm Boris was stuck in one place for a long time. Scientists say that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall. Warmer oceans also lead to more evaporation, feeding storm systems. For every 1C rise in the global average temperature, the atmosphere is able to hold about 7% more moisture."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l4g6g5d97o,Springfield grapples with false pet-eating rumours - and real problems,"Locals say they are facing serious issues with housing, jobs and harassment, even though pet-eating rumours are false.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A week after Donald Trump's comments at a presidential debate thrust this city in south-west Ohio into the national spotlight, people here are still struggling at times to separate fact from fiction. The cameras have mostly been put away, the Proud Boys have gone home, and the town of Springfield, Ohio seems to have reached a shaky, temporary peace. The only sign of the chaos of this past week is state troopers guarding local schools, called in by Ohio Gov Mike DeWine after nearly 30 bomb threats against schools and government buildings. State authorities say the threats have mostly come from outside the US, but their exact origin – and who’s behind them – is still a mystery. If there is one thing that most people are certain about here, it's that the rumour that kicked everything off - that Haitians are regularly capturing and eating pet cats and dogs - is false. At first glance Springfield looks like a typical small midwestern city. Its virtues include stately homes from the city's heyday, a few busy downtown blocks, an art museum, a leafy campus and a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house. But not far away are areas full of decaying strip malls backed by blocks of boarded-up houses and threaded through with chewed-up, potholed streets. Springfield's population had been declining for decades before a few years ago, when Haitians were drawn here by the relatively low cost of living and the promise of work in local factories. City estimates of the number of Haitians here range from 12,000 to 20,000, in a city previously home to about 60,000, according to the 2020 census. Business owners and some residents have welcomed the newcomers, but some have complained about rent increases, strains on local schools and hospitals and dangerous drivers. Tensions were amplified last year when a car driven by a Haitian immigrant hit a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. And then in recent weeks came the cat rumours. They began with a YouTube clip containing a second-hand account and a Facebook post attributed to the friend of the daughter of a neighbour. The woman behind the post recently retracted her account, saying she looked further into the story and determined it wasn't true. But the idea that Haitian immigrants were eating pets - allegations that have long been lobbed at a variety of immigrant groups in many countries - had already gone viral. They spread to right-wing accounts with big followings, until they were repeated online by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, and by Trump during last Wednesday's debate. ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs,"" he said. ""The people that came in, they're eating the cats."" Following the debate, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue, a Republican, told BBC Newsnight people need to better understand ""the weight of their words and how it can negatively affect communities"". It's unclear why Trump mentioned dogs - the online rumours focused on cats and also on wild ducks and geese. Local police have not recorded any cases of pets being devoured. Independent, right-wing and pro-Trump news sources searched for evidence, in some cases offering rewards for proof of cat abduction. So far no evidence of pet eating has come to light. Despite the false claims, Trump's comments put Springfield in the national spotlight, increasing tensions between the Haitian community and local residents. Trump told a rally in New York on Wednesday that he would hold an event in the Ohio city soon. ""I'm going to go there in the next two weeks,"" Trump said. ""I'm going to Springfield, and I'm going to Aurora"" in Colorado, another city that his campaign has made the focus of claims about immigration. Mayor Rue told a news conference Tuesday that a Trump rally ""would be an extreme strain on our resources"". ""So it'd be fine with me if they decided not to make that visit,"" he said. Haitians here talk of a sense of fear created by misinformation. Laura Koveleski, 26, grew up in the city and along with her Haitian mother runs a business providing translation and other services to the immigrants. She recounted a number of incidents of harassment - beyond the bomb threats - which she says have created a climate of fear and paranoia. ""Haitians, who have just been minding their business, going to work and coming home, are now terrified to walk on the streets or to gather together,"" she said. She also said the immigrant community has been unfairly portrayed as ""illegal"". The city says most of the recent immigrants are legal asylum seekers who have been granted Temporary Protected Status, which gives them permission to work and receive social benefits.  At the same time, many long-term residents fear their concerns are being dismissed out of hand because of the cat-eating falsehoods. One resident who did not want to give his name told the BBC that the Haitians were being taken advantage of, being charged high rent and offered lower wages - with corresponding knock-on economic effects for the existing population. ""They're being used,"" he said. ""They're not getting treated good at all."" But ""everybody's cats are safe, dogs are safe"", he added. He suggested that Haitians, who have been encouraged to move here by some local businesses to help with post-pandemic labour shortages, are being exploited by businesses and government officials. Rumours that white vans have been transporting more migrants here continued to worry some residents. In reality, the vans are factory transportation vehicles taking workers to jobs. At Haitian restaurant Rose Goute in the south of Springfield, businessman Jacob Payen says life for Haitians like him has become ""complicated"" in the last week. ""A lot of people are living in fear they don't even want to go out to the grocery stores, and that bothers me, because it wasn't like that before,"" he said. Mr Payen, 46, who runs a religious and spiritual goods store and helps out at Rose Goute, first emigrated to Florida where he lived for two decades before moving to Springfield three years ago. ""The whole place was looking like a ghost town. It was abandoned,"" he recalls. When he first heard the rumours, he says, he thought ""maybe somebody's joking, or maybe somebody is doing a prank on the community"". ""But then we hear it from the former president and his vice-president (nominee). Then it becomes serious,"" he said. Mr Vance, in an interview with CNN, said: ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do."" He then clarified that he based his statements about pet-eating on ""first-hand accounts from my constituents"". The Ohio senator, who grew up about 50 miles (80km) away from Springfield, has not given further details. His office did not respond to requests for comment. Vance and Trump's comments have brought a flurry of attention on this city that has only just started to let up. Dozens of bomb threats, many against schools, have set many Springfield families on edge. ""I think they need to leave the schools out of it,"" said one mother outside Spring Hill Elementary School on Tuesday. A local cultural fest, which was supposed to celebrate diversity, has also been cancelled. Several far-right groups appeared here, including a weekend rally by the Proud Boys, but those groups seem to have moved on. Donald Trump, on the other hand, said he may return for a campaign rally, and some residents say they're worried that if that happens, it will start things up again. But while these outside forces have been felt in the town, it's local conflicts that are on everyone's mind. Driving through town, I witnessed a car crash involving a Haitian woman and an elderly local. The Haitian woman's car flipped over. She and her small baby were taken to hospital for evaluation, but nobody involved was seriously injured. It was unclear who exactly was at fault but one of the women in the local's car was adamant that the Haitian driver had run a red light. Shaken from the car crash, she said: ""Haitians, they need to go back, all of them."" Ms Koveleski, who runs the translation and advice service with her Haitian mother, said she understands the concerns of long-time locals - she is one herself. But she recounted a number of stories of harassment and assaults against of Haitian immigrants since last Wednesday's debate. ""There's a woman who came into my office with her small son, who's probably around four years old, and she just wanted a one way ticket (away from Springfield) because she's terrified of someone killing her son,"" she said. ""She says in the area that she lives in she gets people yelling at her. She knows it's hateful, but she doesn't understand what they're saying."" One possible positive outcome of the focus on Springfield, she said, is that it might prompt state and federal authorities to deliver funds to support projects, such as a youth center, that would benefit all residents. ""Haitians are terrified and locals are angry, but now that we have national attention, we can seek federal help, and this can do big things for the town,"" she said. And Mr Payen said he feels heartened by the response from many non-Haitians. He's kept a careful eye on Rose Goute's clientele over the past week and says more than 90% have been non-Haitians. ""They trying to see what the food tastes like,"" he says. ""But they're also coming to support us as a community."" Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y83d2njp1o,Harris gives first solo interview as Democratic nominee,"The US vice-president discussed the economy and gun control in a sit-down that Donald Trump called a ""word salad"".",14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris has conducted the first solo interview of her White House campaign since she took up the baton as the Democrats' presidential candidate nearly two months ago. The US vice-president sat down with a local ABC News station in the key swing state of Pennsylvania to discuss the economy, a political vulnerability, and gun control. Reacting to the interview, her Republican rival, Donald Trump, said she ""had a very hard time yesterday answering the simplest of questions"". Harris and Trump are in a dead heat in Pennsylvania and other battleground states ahead of November's White House election, according to opinion polls.  During Friday's 11-minute sit-down in Johnstown, Harris was asked how she would bring down prices for Americans. Inflation has been receding since it surged early in the Biden administration to a 40-year high, even as unemployment fell to historic lows. She said she would give small-business owners a $50,000 (£38,000) tax deduction to start their enterprises and a $25,000 down payment for first-time homebuyers. The price-tag for the plan and who might qualify are unclear. Last month Harris proposed the ""first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food"", though she did not mention that idea in Friday’s interview. It had provoked criticism from economists and business groups, and Trump likened it to Soviet-style price controls. Harris also told the local ABC station on Friday that she supports constitutional gun rights, but wants to see semi-automatic weapons prohibited. ""I feel very strongly that it is consistent with the Second Amendment and your right to own a gun to also say we need an assault weapons ban,"" she said. ""They're literally tools of war."" Harris went on to take a swing at Trump, saying the American people need someone to bring the country together, unlike her rival, who she said was ""trying to have us point our fingers at each other"". She was also asked how she differed from the current US president, who suspended his campaign on 21 July and endorsed her. Harris repeated a line from the debate, saying she is ""obviously not Joe Biden"". She also said she would ""offer a new generation of leadership"".  Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday morning that the interview was “a world salad, a real mess!” Harris’ campaign was boosted this week when opinion polls suggested she won her first debate on Tuesday with Trump. The Republican has since said he will not debate her again, claiming he was the winner. Amid calls for her to grant more media access, Harris last month sat down on CNN for her first interview since becoming the nominee, joined by her running mate Tim Walz.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9858r32dm1o,Anti-apartheid veteran and corruption fighter Gordhan dies,Pravin Gordhan was known for trying to stand up to corruption under former President Jacob Zuma.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"South Africa's former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, has died at the age of 75, his family said. The anti-apartheid struggle veteran played a key role in South Africa's transition to democracy and helped negotiate the end of white-minority rule.  As well as finance minister, he occupied other top government and administrative roles since the 1990s until he announced his retirement from politics in May.  The veteran cabinet minister died in hospital early on Friday after ""a short, courageous battle with cancer"", his family said in a statement.  It added that he was ""surrounded by his family, closest friends and his lifelong comrades in the liberation struggle when he passed away in the early hours this morning"". He is credited with turning around the national tax agency - the South African Revenue Service - and making it a credible and effective institution between 1999 to 2009. Gordhan was then finance minister until 2014 and was seen as a competent safe pair of hands, who encouraged  stability and discipline at the treasury.  He returned to the job the following year after the debacle when President Jacob Zuma appointed the relatively unknown David van Rooyen to the post and sacked him just four days later, following accusations that his appointment had been prompted by business allies of the president. Gordhan was seen for many years as the face of resistance against widespread corruption known as ""State Capture"" during Zuma's presidency, and gave evidence about Zuma's role in South Africa's financial decay at a public inquiry known as the Zondo Commission. Gordhan was born in 1949 in the eastern port city of Durban. His parents were traders, who had emigrated to South Africa from India in the 1920s. From the early 1970s, Gordhan, as a pharmacy student, became involved in the struggle against white-minority rule. In the following decade he was a key figure in the United Democratic Front (UDF), a coalition of anti-apartheid organisations. He was jailed several times for his activism. In 1991, he co-chaired the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), which was responsible for negotiating the end of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic government. He was a prominent figure in the fight against ""State Capture"", a term used in South Africa to describe the alleged undue influence of private interests over state institutions, often for corrupt purposes. In 2017, he was dramatically sacked in a midnight cabinet reshuffle as he was seen as a bulwark against corruption in President Zuma's administration, which was facing growing criticism.  The Gupta family of businessman, close associates of Zuma, were at the centre of these allegations. Both the Guptas and Zuma deny any wrongdoing. In 2016, Gordhan was charged with fraud but the charges were later dropped. His allies said they were politically motivated. He returned to government as public enterprises minister in 2018 after Zuma was ousted. That was to be Gordhan's final cabinet role and his stellar record came under intense scrutiny. His ministry was responsible for South Africa’s power utility Eskom at a time when rolling blackouts known as load-shedding were at an all-time high. He also came under fire for his handling of plans to sell part of the government's stake in the national airline South African Airways. Some of those close to him believe he was incorrectly blamed for the chaos at these institutions. ""He was attacked, he was not very much liked. Not that we wanted to be liked. He didn’t do his work to be liked, he did his job because that’s what he was there for,"" said South Africa's former ambassador to the US Sheila Sisulu. But Gordhan's ""heroic reputation"" as a ""stalwart of the ANC"" helped to shield him from the worst criticism he could have received for his performance as the minister responsible for fixing compromised state-owned enterprises, policy analyst Angelo Fick told the BBC. ""In real terms anyone else would certainly have been thought to have fallen foul."" Gordhan announced his retirement ahead of the May 2024 elections and kept a low profile since then. ""I have no regrets, no regrets… We have made our contribution,"" Gordhan said in a farewell message before his death. In recent days, friends and social justice activists had gathered at a candlelit vigil for him, and heaped praise on the work he did to reform state institutions for the better. In his tribute, President Cyril Ramaphosa described Gordhan as an outstanding leader and a beacon of the fight against corruption. ""He fought to liberate this country from the shackles of Apartheid, from inequality, from poverty and from hunger,"" Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa urged the country to remember Gordhan's ""personal sacrifices""  from his anti-apartheid activism days, right up to the last days he retired from active politics. ""He was driven by a vision of a society in which all people may achieve their full potential and in which all may realise their dreams."" Gordhan is survived by his wife Vanitha and their daughters Anisha and Priyesha. Additional reporting by Natasha Booty Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Mr Musk has since deleted the post and said it was intended as a joke.  His post on X, formerly Twitter, came just hours after the suspected attempted assassination of Donald Trump at his golf course in Florida on Sunday.  The tech billionaire is a close ally of Trump, who has vowed to enlist Mr Musk to run a “government efficiency commission” if he wins a second term as US president.  Many X users criticised Mr Musk's comments - which were accompanied by a raised eyebrow emoji - with some alleging that the post was a form of incitement against the US president and vice-president.  In a statement, the White House condemned the post, saying that ""this rhetoric is irresponsible"".  ""Violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about,"" the statement said, adding that there should be ""no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country"".  When contacted by the BBC, the US Secret Service said only that it is ""aware"" of the post.  ""As a matter of practice we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence,"" the statement added. ""We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees.""  After deleting the post, Mr Musk tweeted that ""one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X.""  ""Turns out that jokes are way less funny if people don't know the context and the delivery is in plain text,"" a subsequent post read.  The controversial tech mogul is considered a close ally of Trump and formally endorsed him in the aftermath of a separate assassination attempt against the former president that took place at a rally on 13 July in Butler, Pennsylvania.  In that attempt, the suspect fired multiple rounds, injuring Trump and killing an attendee at the rally.  Since then, Mr Musk has often tweeted or re-posted messages critical of both Biden and Harris and in support of Trump. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrjrkveplvo,Brexit truce as pro-EU Lib Dems focus on long game,Lib Dems manage expectations of steps towards rejoining the EU ahead of their autumn conference.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Once the party of “stop Brexit”, the Liberal Democrats toned down their zeal for the European Union ahead of this year’s general election. The party swelled its ranks to 72 MPs - its most ever - without drawing much attention to its original policy of rejoining the EU. But as Lib Dems gather for their autumn conference this weekend, will the B-word will be back on their lips? “It’s no secret that a lot of the grassroots would have preferred the party leadership to take a slightly stronger line before the election on rejoining the EU,” says Rob Harrison, the chairman of the Liberal Democrat European Group. Now the general election is behind us, Harrison says, “I do think the party leadership could be bolder on Europe”. To the frustration of some Lib Dem Europhiles, a gradualist approach to rebuilding ties with the EU is favoured by party leader Sir Ed Davey. His 2024 election campaigning focused on a few core issues, above all social care, and given the dramatic increase in Lib Dem MPs, few would dare to say it hasn’t worked. In cautious wording, the general election manifesto laid out “essential steps on the road to EU membership, which remains our longer-term objective”. The party's four-stage roadmap includes seeking to join EU programmes and eventually, the single market, which allows the free movement of goods, services and people. This weekend, there was another staging post on this journey. At the conference in Brighton, party activists voted to approve a policy proposal to give young people better access to the EU. Delegates unanimously passed a motion calling for the government to open negotiations for a youth mobility scheme for under-35s, abolish visa fees and join the Erasmus Plus student scheme. Before the conference, the BBC spoke to six Lib Dem activists and two MPs - and most of them seemed satisfied with the party’s direction of travel on Europe. “Brexit has happened, and that’s unfortunate,” says Janey Little, chairwoman of the Young Liberals. “But we will always be at the front of the agenda of pushing for a closer relationship with Europe and rebuilding those ties.” Another Young Liberal, Ulysse Abbate, says the party should be focusing on “easy wins”, such as a youth mobility scheme between the UK and the EU. There is some discontent though. Mark Johnston is an EU policy specialist and member of the committee that prepared the party’s manifesto. He says that “all parties have been silent on Brexit in the past few years” and there were no signs the Lib Dems would change tack. “We shouldn’t be tip-toeing around this issue,” Johnston says. “We should be making it a key part of our offer in every election going forward through this cycle to distinguish ourselves from Labour.” Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has repeatedly said he would not seek to rejoin the EU and has instead promised to ""make Brexit work"". Johnston says: “We’ve got to differentiate ourselves from Labour in the voter's mind, and not just be running with a ‘we’re not the Tories' message, because the value of that will fade very quickly.” Other Lib Dem activists do see differences with Labour, but aren’t so sure voters care that much about Brexit. During the general election campaign, “it wasn’t really in the public’s mind”, says David Chalmers, a veteran pro-EU Lib Dem. “They were really concerned about the cost of living, the NHS and sewage. If you start talking about rejoining Europe, you’re not actually listening to people.” Helen Morgan, the Lib Dem MP for North Shropshire, says she has been listening to lots of people in her constituency, which voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. She says locally, A&E waiting times, potholes and energy costs this winter were the issues that came up on the doorstep most frequently. “I spoke personally to probably more than 1,000 people during the course of the election campaign,” Morgan says. “I talked about Europe maybe a handful of times.” Josh Babarinde - the new MP for Eastbourne - says there was no mass clamour to immediately rejoin the EU in mail from his constituents. But if voters want that eventually, “our stance on Brexit was there in black and white”, he says. “I don’t think anyone will be in any doubt where Liberal Democrat sympathies lie when it comes to Brexit.” What is in doubt, though, is the timeframe the party has in mind for rejoining the EU. Even the chairman of the Liberal Democrat European Group - which he describes as “the fan group for the EU” - is managing his expectations. “We’re talking about the 2034 Parliament,” Harrison says. “That is when we might feasibly get a rejoin application in.” Sir Ed has gone no way near such specifics. Rebuilding trust with European partners takes time, he often says. As long as he’s in charge and the Lib Dems keep performing well in elections, the Europhile wing of the party will have to play the long game. For now, as the Lib Dems celebrate a record result in the general election, the Brexit truce is holding."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynexz6l1eo,US plans to block Nippon Steel takeover of US Steel - US media,The controversial move comes during a heated election year in the US.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"President Joe Biden is preparing to block the takeover of a storied US steel-maker by a Japanese company, a controversial move that critics say would lead to job losses and could chill foreign investment in the US, according to US media reports. The $15bn deal was announced by Japan's Nippon Steel and US Steel last year. It would have created one of the world's biggest steel companies outside of China and had been hailed by investors as an answer to the company's financial woes.  But it soon ran into resistance from politicians and the US Steelworkers union, which said it did not want to see the 123-year-old firm fall into foreign hands.  US Steel shares fell nearly 20% after reports of the decision, which involves a company headquartered Pennsylvania, a swing state, during a heated campaign season.  Mr Biden had already moved to have the deal probed on national security grounds and voiced opposition to the takeover earlier this year. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, rivals in the race for president, have also come out against the merger. US Steel said it had not received any update about a formal decision and said it stood by the deal, noting that Japan was one of America's ""most staunch allies"".  ""We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to ensure this transaction, which is [the] best future for Pennsylvania, American steelmaking, and all of our stakeholders, closes,"" a spokesman said.  Earlier on Wednesday, the company held a rally to show support for the merger.  It warned that blocking the deal would put ""thousands of jobs"" at risk, prompting it to shut factories and potentially move its headquarters from Pennsylvania. ""We want elected leaders and other key decision makers to recognise the benefits of the deal as well as the unavoidable consequences if the deal fails,"" chief executive David Burrit said in a statement announcing a rally in favour of the plans. The deal has been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a group led by the Treasury Department that looks at national security concerns.  Treasury declined to comment on the president's decision, which was first reported by the Washington Post and Financial Times. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US had not yet given a recommendation to the president.  Speaking to the BBC, a White House official did not deny reports of that the president planned to block the deal, saying only that receiving the CFIUS recommendation would be the ""next step in this process"". As of 2020, the US had formally blocked just five foreign investments via CFIUS, deals that involved Chinese firms.  Nippon Steel is based in Japan, a US ally.  Earlier this year, the US Chamber of Commerce warned against politicising such reviews, saying officials risked sending a ""chilling signal"" to firms abroad.  Though the involvement of CFIUS makes this case unusual, political intervention in the steel industry is not, said Alan Wolff, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former trade lawyer who has worked with firms, including US Steel. More than 20 years ago, George W Bush, ""otherwise a free-trader"", put in place protections for steel, he noted.   Donald Trump's administration was also marked by a trade fight over tariffs put in place to protect US steelmakers. Biden modified those protections, easing tensions with allies, but still kept in place some guards. The economic stature of US steel, founded by Andrew Carnegie, may have shrunk, but it still plays a big role in our national psyche, Mr Wolff said. ""It has a big part in our view of where manufacturing has gone and the threat to manufacturing jobs,"" he said. ""That's a big part of the Biden administration and it's a big part of this election,"" he said. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdey85yw4npo,Trump 'fine-tuning theatrics' before Harris debate,"The vice-president, meanwhile, is practising how to handle Trump's attacks while trying out lines designed to rattle him.",9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"American presidential debates aren't won on policy. I've covered six presidential elections and have never seen a debate where one candidate emerged as the winner because they made an outstanding policy proposal. Sure, the ABC News moderators at Tuesday's debate will ask Donald Trump and Kamala Harris earnest questions about tax cuts and foreign affairs.  But what viewers always focus on are the moments where one candidate has a zinger of a line, or somehow unnerves their opponent, or simply seems more in control. This is perhaps why an adviser to Trump tells me the former president hasn't spent his prep time brushing up on policy.  Instead, he's been ""fine-tuning the theatrics of his performance"". If there's one thing that Trump understands well, it's television audiences. He has also been on a presidential debate stage six times already.  For Kamala Harris, this poses a problem. This is her debut. She has not had much rehearsal time and it's hard to become a world class performer in a couple of weeks. Unlike her opponent, Ms Harris has spent the past week holed up in a Pennsylvania hotel deep in policy books - but her team has also tried to prepare her to win the optics battle too. The Harris team has reportedly built a mock television stage - fully fitted with a debate podium and proper lighting.  Top advisers are standing-in and playing the role of Trump (with one of them reportedly even dressing in his signature boxy suits and red ties). All of this is in a bid to get Ms Harris comfortable with the theatre of it all. They've also been reviewing hours of video of all those Trump debates, seeing which plays work well against him and which fall flat. If the vice-president was hoping for a burst of last minute good news to quell any stage fright, she didn't get it. A New York Times poll this week has rattled Democrats.  The poll showed a neck-and-neck race between the two candidates, but a sizeable share of voters said they didn't feel they knew enough about Ms Harris. One Democratic strategist texted to say they are nervous about the debate because they felt Ms Harris was tentative in a recent CNN interview.  Ask any of the Republicans who Trump demolished in the 2016 primary debates and they will surely tell you that ""tentative"" is not a winning strategy against him. Since the American public knows far more about Trump than about Ms Harris, the stakes for her seem higher on Tuesday night. One approach she may take in trying to win this debate will be doing all she can to ensure that Trump loses it. Her team wants to rattle him, to get him to be the most ""Trumpian"" version of himself.  They hope that if viewers see him behave badly, as he did in a 2020 debate against Joe Biden, it will cost him support. I'm told Ms Harris may use trigger words like ""old"" (old ideas, old story) and ""small"" (small thinking, small beliefs) as a way to needle him on the basis that Trump is conscious of being the older candidate, and references to size seem to irritate him. But goading him into rude interruptions will be difficult in this debate, because the candidates' microphones will be muted when it's not their turn to speak. Until we see what happens on that stage, it's hard to determine what a win for either candidate looks like. Debates are unpredictable things. Just ask Mr Biden.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ngep290go,Why elections are a bitter pill for many Algerians to swallow,"With the military wielding enormous influence over politics, many doubt elections will bring change.",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Despite being a doctor who runs his own clinic in Algeria, Adlan does not stop thinking of emigrating to Europe as he doubts that Saturday's presidential election will usher in a new era of democracy and prosperity in his home country.  ""I am bitter and disappointed,"" Dr Adlan, who preferred not to give his surname, tells me when I meet him in a cafe in the capital, Algiers.  And yet five years ago his hopes - like those of many other Algerians who were part of the Hirak movement - were high that freedom and democracy were at hand. A father of two, he regularly participated in a popular uprising that forced Algeria’s longest-serving president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to step down after 20 years in power. ""I protested for nearly 50 Fridays in a row. We wanted our voices to be heard, we dreamed of accountability,"" Dr Adlan says.  But today, the situation in Algeria is not very different from what has happened in other North African states such as Egypt and Tunisia following the Arab Spring, which was aimed at ending authoritarian rule.  Algeria's street protests failed to diminish the power of the military, influential since independence and which continues to pull the strings. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 78, is widely seen as being backed by the generals and won elections in 2019 after Mr Bouteflika was forced to step down. He is expected to easily secure a second term in the poll being contested by two other candidates - Abdelaali Hassani, head of the Movement of Society of Peace, and Youcef Aouchiche, who leads the Front of Socialist Forces. The election commission disqualified 13 candidates - including Zubaida Assoul, a lawyer and an opposition party leader who took part in the 2019 protests. ""The authorities don’t want to hold real elections that can bring about solid change,"" she says. ""All the states resources have been dedicated to the president’s campaign."" The law required candidates to collect 50,000 signatures from registered voters, across various provinces, or 600 signatures from members of parliamentary and local councils, to qualify to run for the presidency. Ms Assoul believes the requirements were intended to make it insurmountable for candidates like her to contest the poll. ""How could any candidate collect 50,000 endorsements in one month, during summer vacation, and in a huge county like Algeria?"" Ms Assoul says. But Abdelrahman Saleh, the head of a party that supports Mr Tebboune, dismisses her criticism.  ""They failed to complete the required documents, and tried to find an excuse for their failure. I wish they were responsible enough, to admit that they couldn’t convince voters,"" he says. Dr Adlan tells me that dozens of his fellow doctors have left for Europe in the past five years.  Algerians are largely French-speaking, so their favourite destinations are usually France, and sometimes, the French-speaking provinces in Canada. While some Algerians follow the legal route to search for a better life abroad, others make the risky journey, via the Mediterranean, to reach Europe's shores. ""Thousands jump into dinghies, throwing themselves into the unknown because they can’t stand their life here anymore,"" Dr Adlan says. Although there are no accurate figures, illegal migration has always been a deeply rooted problem across North Africa.  Many of the youth cannot take their dire living conditions anymore. Despite its natural wealth of oil and gas, youth unemployment in Algeria is above 30%, according to the International Labour Organization. President Tebboune has promised to create more jobs if he wins a second term, but his critics doubt if he can fix the chronic problem of unemployment and bring about economic prosperity. I ask Dr Adlan if he is going to vote - he is one of nearly 24 million registered voters. But he tells me he is undecided. Next to him sits AbdelWakeel Blam, a journalist who also took part in the 2019 protests. He says he is boycotting the polls. ""How can we have a fair and democratic election, when journalists and activists go to jail over a social media post? ""I had to quit a couple of jobs, due to restrictions on freedom of expression,"" he says with a voice full of anger. But pro-government voices reject such criticism. Mr Saleh says that only people who violate the law are prosecuted. ""No journalists are held behind bars in Algeria due to their work. Neither are there any politicians detained because of their political views. It’s all about breaching the law,"" he says. Voting will take place between 07:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT, with preliminary results expected on Sunday. If no candidate wins an absolute majority, a second round will be held between the two leading candidates. As I walk around in Algiers, I spot very few campaign posters and banners. I ask some people why more of a campaign buzz does not exist.  ""What for? We all know who the winner is,"" one of them replies. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98486dzxnzo,HS2 blew billions - here's how and why,How did HS2 manage to go so far over its original budget?,16 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"There is no shortage of places to start when trying to make sense of what went wrong for HS2 and how for around twice the original budget we’re getting half the line that was planned. One starting place is the name itself - High Speed 2. Nobody wants a slow railway. But was it ever wise to build a super-fast one? HS2’s journey began in the 1980s. Rail experts looked across the channel at France’s new high-speed TGV network and dreamed of a similar service here. The TGV trains swishing through the French countryside at just under 200 mph were in stark contrast to the UK’s creaking rolling stock. HS2 promised gleaming new trains racing between English cities at even faster speeds. A government commissioned study in 2006 had concluded Britain needed greater rail capacity. Launching his report, Sir Rod Eddington said: “My first recommendation to Government is…to improve the capacity and the performance of the existing transport network.” He was lukewarm on speed. HS2 did bring increased capacity but, as the name demonstrates, it was clearly sold on speed. A few weeks before Gordon Brown’s Labour government left office in May 2010, they made the case for High Speed Rail to MPs. They said building a conventional rail line to address capacity issues would cost almost as much as building a high-speed line. Little did they know. Andrew Gilligan was a transport advisor to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak and is a critic of HS2. “Unlike Spain or France or Germany, all the main cities of England are within 200 miles of all the others, apart from Newcastle,” he says. “The extra time you save simply isn't worth the enormous extra expense of building it.” But speed helped attract politicians to it with the promise of a super quick connection between London and Birmingham, with trains racing further north to Leeds and Manchester. London to Manchester would take just over an hour instead of just over two. HS2: The Railway that Blew Billions HS2 was meant to be the railway of the future, but more than a decade on the project is mired in uncertainty. Richard Bilton investigates what went wrong. Watch on BBC iPlayer But faster trains don’t only require better motors. A train that travels at 230 mph needs a very straight line and that’s where cost starts to come in. To get to Birmingham from London, it would need to go through the heart of the Chilterns, an area of outstanding national beauty. Less controversial routes like alongside the M40 motorway were ruled out. Opposition came from Tory MPs speaking on behalf of unhappy Chilterns residents. They demanded expensive tunnels and cuttings to keep the new trains out of sight. Preserving the rolling hills meant more money went on engineering. In the end, 11 tunnels were commissioned between London and Birmingham, burying the line for 32 miles of the 140 mile track. There were 50 viaducts. Philip Hammond was Conservative transport secretary from 2010 to 2011 and Chancellor from 2016 to 2019. “I think we drove much more cost into the project than people perhaps were understanding at the time,” he says. In 2011, HS2 was costed at £32 billion. By 2013, the budget had risen to just over £50 billion. From the start, questions have been raised about HS2’s use of taxpayers’ money. In 2009, the Labour government had set up HS2 Limited: a company spending public money, one whose existence was by definition dependent on the project not being dropped. Andrew Bruce joined the company in 2015. His job was to buy all the land and property for phase one of the project. He says that in his first week he was given two sets of figures. According to Mr Bruce, one set was to be used to show the government in presentations. He says these showed HS2 was on track to purchase the land on time and on budget. He says he was also given a second set of figures which showed there was no way HS2 could buy all the land and properties needed while keeping to that budget. And he says his own work subsequently found even higher estimates for land and property costs. He says that HS2 Ltd was not being honest about the likely costs even though HS2 Ltd was being paid for by the taxpayer and spending public money. HS2 disputes this. It says these allegations have been put under intense scrutiny by the National Audit Office which found nothing untoward. Andrew Bruce doesn’t accept the conclusions that HS2 draws from the NAO findings. He believes there should be further investigation. One insight into how HS2 Ltd operated can be gleaned from the redundancy payments it gave its staff when jobs moved from London to Birmingham. The Commons Public Accounts Committee found that had HS2 followed statutory redundancy terms, 94 individuals would have received a total of £1 million. In fact, they received a total of £2.76 million, paid for by the taxpayer. “We were very, very cross about that. We felt that signalled an attitude at HS2, that it was other people's money that they were spending, and they were looking after their own,” Dame Meg Hillier MP (Labour and Co-Op), then chair of the committee, told me. At the time of the committee’s report HS2 Ltd acknowledged the payments were a “serious error”. You might have thought a megaproject costing billions would be a political priority. However, in 2017, Brexit was dominating the agenda and if an outsider had the impression that MPs were distracted when they voted through the country’s biggest infrastructure project, they’d be right. Philip Hammond told me: “I'm sorry to disappoint you, but HS2 was not the main issue of the moment. The government was teetering on the brink, trying to deal with the daily hourly pressures of the Brexit negotiation. Long-term projects were perhaps not seen as quite as immediately urgent.” By the time of the vote, many believed the likely costs would be much more than the officially budgeted £55.7 billion. An internal government document produced just before the HS2 scheme was finally approved by Parliament in 2017 suggested the final figure could increase to more than £80 billion. Lord Hammond told us it would be unrealistic for every bit of treasury modelling to go before parliament. It just so happens that on this occasion the modelling was right, and by 2019 the new figure was indeed almost £80 billion. And what of the machinery of state’s role in all this? Did the civil service do its bit to provide the true picture of rising costs? Bernadette Kelly was the top civil servant in the Department for Transport. In October 2018 and May 2019 she appeared in front of the Public Accounts Committee. At the time, her department was aware that projected costs were rising. But in public, she stuck to the official budget figure of £55.7 billion. Meg Hillier was not happy with Kelly’s evidence: “We felt it wasn't as forthcoming, and she wasn't as forthcoming as she should have been to the Public Accounts Committee. And it, you know, came close to misleading Parliament…” Dame Bernadette Kelly says when she appeared before the committee her comments were accurate and reflected the then government’s position. Whatever the case, it’s pretty clear that the parliamentary committee whose job it is to scrutinise public spending felt it wasn’t getting a clear picture of what was going on with the country’s biggest infrastructure project at a time when it was ballooning in cost. Meg Hillier says trying to keep a hold of HS2’s budget highlighted an age-old problem with the way government handles big spending projects like HS2. “It's a dance that gets played. A sort of shadowboxing that goes on between the taxpayer, parliament and government.” The consequences of that might not always be enormous but with a project of this size and complexity, the shadowboxing can cost the taxpayer billions. HS2 has been through seven prime ministers and five general elections. It’s been a long-term national infrastructure project in a short-term and highly volatile political cycle, one where politicians needed it to deliver personally for them. David Cameron adopted HS2 because it supported his idea of a Northern Powerhouse. For Boris Johnson, HS2 was about delivering on his promise of levelling up Britain after Brexit. After his 2019 election success, the high-speed line became part of that agenda. Former journalist Andrew Gilligan was Boris Johnson’s transport advisor. “He'd scored a huge victory, on the basis of an awful lot of people who'd never voted Tory before in the north,” he says. “He was concerned that if we cancelled HS2, it would harm his chances of re-election.” Eventually political support for the original vision of HS2 crumbled. The music didn’t so much stop for the line as fade out: the leg to Leeds was winnowed away and lost finally in 2021. In 2023 then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cut the leg between Birmingham and Manchester. All that was left was the line between Birmingham and suburban west London – for now, trains would terminate at Old Oak Common and not Euston in the centre of the capital because of a lack of cash. HS2’s problems are very close to home for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Euston site is in his constituency. The government’s last estimate of the overall cost for the remaining Birmingham to London stretch is between £45 and £54 billion. But independent rail expert Michael Byng says it could go high as £87.8 billion. That would mean taxpayers forking out more than double the original budget for half of the line that was promised. Andy Burnham, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, says it’s crucial we learn the lessons. He says even after all the money that’s been spent the north is still short of capacity and needs a new line. “The handling of HS2 should be like a morality tale in Whitehall. This was the worst example of utter waste of public money.” Last week Mr Burnham was one of those unveiling plans for a new rail line linking the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, one that its backers say can be delivered at a fraction of the cost of the scrapped northern leg of HS2. Labour’s new transport secretary Louise Haigh told me: “...the serious financial challenges we have inherited on this project have become apparent, and it's dire."" Some say, irrespective of the cost, in the end the nation will be grateful for HS2. The argument goes that infrastructure projects often overspend, the focus should be on long-term benefits. But few projects overspend on such a massive scale and deliver so much less than was promised. When it opens – in about 10 years – that much-needed rail capacity between the south and Birmingham will have increased significantly. But a journey on HS2 from Birmingham to London’s western suburbs and then into the centre of the capital will take about the same time as a train between Euston and Birmingham does now. For that stretch of railway, High Speed 2 might be better named High Capacity 2. Had that been the main aim from the start, a lot of cost and grief might have been avoided.

Ministers say the devolution deal agreed with the last government was not ambitious enough and only made provision for a directly elected leader rather than a mayor.  Under the plans, both counties would have received between £16m and £20m a year to spend on infrastructure and other projects The news has been greeted with fury by council leaders with one calling it a ""slap in the face""  Both deals were due to kick in next year, with elections for the new directly elected leader for each authority taking place in May. But the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has told us ""we will not be proceeding with the Single Local Authority mayoral deals proposed in Norfolk and Suffolk"" The thinking behind devolution was that local leaders know the needs of their communities better than Whitehall.  Under the deals for Norfolk and Suffolk, the two counties would have had a directly elected leader with greater control over building, skills training, adult education and possibly transport. There would have been extra money for local projects: £20m a year for Norfolk and £16m a year for Suffolk, guaranteed for 30 years. Those in favour of the plans said, in time, the counties would have been able to take on more powers, while money could be borrowed to fund major infrastructure projects.  But critics had called it a very poor deal compared with other devolution agreements.   A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said  “This government strongly believes that mayors should have a unique role, while council leaders must continue to focus on the delivery of the essential services"". “We want to see those two functions kept separate as this benefits the community and its people, which is why we will not be proceeding with the Single Local Authority mayoral deals proposed in Norfolk and Suffolk"" This seems to have been the main concern of the Minister for English Devolution Jim McMahon. He is worried that a directly elected council leader would be too beholden to his or her local party. He believes a directly elected Mayor would be removed from party politics and more independent. I also understand that in meetings with local MPs he expressed concern that the deals were not ambitious enough. He is also understood to have concerns about how the last Government was planning to fund them .  The Conservatives had always said the funding would come from existing government budgets. The Government spokesman also stressed that “Devolution is central to the government’s mission to economic growth"".  It is being made clear that ministers want  a devolution deal for the two counties, just not this one.  Both Norfolk and Suffolk County councils are run by the Conservatives so, not surprisingly, they are angry.  Matthew Hicks, the leader of Suffolk County Council called the news ""a slap in the face"" saying the deal had widespread public support.  “Governments of any colour should be pro devolution because councils know how best to serve local people"" he said.  Kay Mason Billig the leader of Norfolk County Council said she was ""bitterly dissappointed""  “For a government that is keen on economic growth, this is a short sighted and damaging decision, Norfolk deserves better than this""  Both leaders complained that they had not had a chance to meet ministers to discuss the plans. They called for urgent talks to try to salvage as much of the deal as possible.  The Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk, Steffan Aquarone, who is also a county councillor said “Our fantastic county has felt overlooked by successive governments, and today we are seeing it happen yet again"" ""I am concerned that this is trying to pave the way for bundling Norfolk and Suffolk into an ill-fitting shared devolution deal"" But these deals  also had their critics who see this as an opportunity to get a better deal for the two counties. Steve Morphew, the Labour opposition leader on Norfolk County council said ""Nobody should be mourning what was always a second rate deal"" ""Now we have a real opportunity to negotiate with a government that wants us to be ambitious and fulfil Norfolk’s potential"" Follow Norfolk and Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vxvzg34qwo,Why Kamala Harris is highlighting her gun ownership,"The Democratic nominee for president has joked that anyone who breaks into her house is ""getting shot"".",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has highlighted a little-known aspect of her biography - the fact that she is a gun owner - to stake out ground on the issue of firearms control. After Donald Trump claimed during their presidential debate that she would ""confiscate everybody's gun"" if elected, Harris replied by reaffirming that she was a gun owner herself - like her running mate, Tim Walz. ""We’re not taking anyone’s guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff,"" she told Trump. The following week, Harris added that she would be willing to use her gun if an intruder entered her home. ""If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot,"" she said during a livestreamed event with Oprah Winfrey. Gun control remains among the most contentious issues in American politics but has largely taken a backseat to other policy areas this election. The question raised during the showdown with Trump over where exactly Harris stood was the first time the issue had even come up in a 2024 debate. Now that the issue has been raised, critics have pounced on it as an example of Harris's shifting policy positions.  Despite stressing to Winfrey that she supports gun ownership, the Democratic candidate has also argued for tougher laws. She told the host that she continued to support a ban on assault weapons. A firearm of that type was ""literally designed to be a tool of war"", she said. Harris has also recently spoken in favour of more thorough background checks and so-called red-flag laws. These allow people to apply to a judge to confiscate another person's gun if they are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others. But Harris has also dropped her previous support for a buyback programme for assault weapons. Gun buyback proposals would force gun owners to hand over their AR-15s and other assault-style weapons to the government.  They gained steam during the last election's Democratic presidential primary race, when they received endorsements from a number of senior Democrats including Harris.  In October 2019, said she supported taking the nation's millions of assault weapons ""off the streets, but doing it in the right way"". Buyback initiatives have taken place in cities across the US since at least the 1970s, though research indicates that they are often very expensive and not effective as a standalone strategy to curb gun violence. Advocates, however, point to the impact of two mandatory buybacks in Australia following the deadliest mass shooting on its soil in 1996. The country has largely avoided mass firearm violence since that incident. Harris made her own case for buybacks as part of a broader effort to rein in the ""clear problem"" of gun violence. She argued that politicians were offering voters ""a false choice"" between protecting gun rights and taking guns away.   But by the time the 2024 presidential debate came round, ABC News moderator Linsey Davis noted that Harris no longer supported a buyback programme. Harris did not directly explain why, and her campaign did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. The furthest that Harris has gone in explaining her gun ownership was also in 2019, when she said: “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do – for personal safety. I was a career prosecutor.” Harris began her career as the district attorney - or the top prosecutor - in Alameda County, and then for the city of San Francisco. She also served from 2011 to 2017 as California's attorney general (AG), the top law enforcement job in the state. Harris still owns that same weapon, which is a handgun, according to an aide. It remains in a secure location at her home in California. William Lockyer, a fellow Democrat who served as California AG himself from 1999 to 2007, told the BBC that it was not uncommon for a local or state-level prosecutor to own a gun, even though the role comes with its own security team. ""I don’t know about Kamala's experience as AG, but I received a threat on average every day during my eight years,"" he said. It is rare for elected officials in Harris's party to speak openly about their experience as gun owners. Her vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, is a notable exception. Walz, from Nebraska, grew up hunting during summer breaks and trained with firearms over the more than two decades he spent as a National Guardsman. At the start of his political career, he held an A rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) - meaning he was a pro-gun politician in the organisation's eyes - and was often spotted wearing an NRA ballcap. But Walz changed tack amid a series of deadly shootings during the 2010s, including at schools in Sandy Hook, Connecticut and Parkland, Florida. He held an F rating from the NRA by the time he left Congress and, as Minnesota governor, he signed expansions of background checks and other restrictions into law. ""I know guns,"" he said at the Democratic National Convention last month. ""I'm a veteran. I'm a hunter. I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress and I have the trophies to prove it. But I'm also a dad. ""I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe that our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.” On the Republican side, Trump has referred to himself as ""the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House"". Speaking to NRA members in February, he bragged that he ""did nothing"" despite pressure to take action after shootings and pledged ""no one will lay a finger on your firearms” if he is re-elected. As a New York resident, Donald Trump owned three licenced firearms, two of which he surrendered in 2023 following his arrest on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The third weapon is said to have been legally transferred to Florida, the state where he now lives. His criminal conviction in New York required that his gun licence there be revoked. Convicted criminals are barred under federal law from owning guns or ammunition, but authorities in Republican-led Florida have expressed no interest in confiscating his weapon. Trump once claimed in an interview that he ""always"" carried a gun. Under Florida law, he can carry his firearm concealed and does not need a permit. The Trump campaign has also said his support for gun rights was unshaken by the attempt on his life this July, when a 20-year-old armed with his father's AR-style rifle shot at least eight rounds in his direction and grazed his right ear with a bullet. JD Vance, his running mate and a former Marine, has described firing guns from an early age and was lauded earlier this year for his ""perfect voting record"" on protecting the Second Amendment by the pro-gun group, Gun Owners of America."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75npd1xw9qo,Fugitive pastor wanted by FBI caught in Philippines,Apollo Quiboloy is charged with child sex trafficking in the US and in the Philippines.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"An influential Filipino pastor wanted in the Philippines and the US for child sex trafficking has been arrested, ending a two-week long standoff between police officers and his followers. Police have been attempting to arrest Apollo Quiboloy, who claims to be the ""Appointed Son of God"", in a raid on his sprawling church compound. Violent scuffles broke out between thousands of his followers and anti-riot police officers, with one church member dying of a heart attack during the raid. Mr Quiboloy, whose Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) claims to have seven million followers, has denied all charges against him. In 2021, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Mr Quiboloy with sex trafficking of children, fraud and coercion and bulk cash smuggling. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said he trafficked girls and women from the Philippines to the US, where they were forced to solicit money for a bogus charity. He also required his female personal assistants, who are called “pastorals”, to have sex with him, the FBI said. But as all this was happening, Mr Quiboloy was rising to national prominence under then-president Rodrigo Duterte, previously serving as spiritual adviser to the former leader.  However, his fortunes turned when Mr Duterte stepped down in June 2022. Filipino authorities soon charged him with child abuse, sexual abuse and human trafficking and a warrant was issued for his arrest. For two weeks , thousands of policemen have been engaged in a standoff with Mr Quiboloy's followers, as they raided his 30-hectare (75-acre) KOJC compound in Davao. They said Mr Quiboloy was hiding in an underground bunker based on the sound of heartbeats detected by surveillance equipment. The complex is home to some 40 buildings, including a cathedral, a school and even a hangar. Interior Minister Benhur Abalos said on Monday that Mr Quiboloy was found inside the compound's bible school. He also said that the pastor was arrested and did not surrender, contrary to earlier reports. Witnesses provided important information that led to his arrest, added Mr Abalos.  Mr Quiboloy's lawyer, Israelito Torreon, said earlier said his client surrendered ""because he does not want the lawless violence to continue to happen"". The regional police chief, Brig Gen Nicolas Torre, said a ""concerted effort of everyone involved"" led to the arrest. Mr Quiboloy and four others who were arrested with him were flown to national police headquarters in the capital Manila where they are currently detained. Before his arrest, Mr Quiboloy said that the ""devil"" was behind his legal woes. He has also said that he does not want the FBI to ""meddle"" in his case. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Marcos said the Philippines was not considering extraditing Mr Quiboloy for now.  The standoff at the KOJC has taken place as a very public falling out between the Marcos and Duterte political families has unfolded.  The US DOJ sought his arrest a few months before Mr Duterte handed power to current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, but it was only during Mr Marcos' term that authorities started pursuing the pastor. While Mr Quiboloy was in hiding, Mr Duterte said he knew where he was but would not tell the police. Mr Duterte's daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte also criticised police pursuing Mr Quiboloy of applying ""questionable"" force. Mr Quiboloy set up the KOJC in Davao in 1985, after hearing God whisper to him “I will use you” while attending an event by American pastor Billy Graham in South Korea in 1973, says the organisation.  When he is not in Davao, he has been seen travelling on his private jet. He delivers his sermons from a glass podium that is set against giant photographs of his lush hilltop estate called the “Garden of Eden Restored”. These are broadcast on his own TV, radio and social media network.  Outside of his long-standing ties with the Duterte's, Mr Quiboloy grew his political influence by endorsing candidates to his followers during elections, a common practice for religious leaders in the country where politics is based on patronage instead of ideology."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9lkgm8xx8o,Harris and Trump to debate in pivotal campaign test,The debate - and the candidates' first face-to-face meeting - comes as polling shows the race in a dead heat.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Presidential debates matter in American politics. And the one that takes place on Tuesday night between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris – their only currently scheduled face-off – may matter more than most. Joe Biden’s poor performance in the first presidential debate in late June created a firestorm of pressure within the Democratic Party that ultimately forced him to abandon his re-election campaign. Even though Kamala Harris has been vice-president for more than three years and a candidate for president for seven weeks, she is still a relative unknown for many Americans. In a recent New York Times survey, 28% of likely November voters said that they needed to know more about the Californian. That poll showed the race a statistical dead heat – a finding most recent surveys have also indicated, both nationally and in key battleground states. The 2024 presidential campaign has been full of historic tumult, but the American electorate is still sharply – and narrowly - divided. That underscores the importance of Tuesday night’s debate, where even small shifts in the mood of the electorate could be the difference between victory and defeat for the candidates. For Harris, the showdown in Philadelphia provides an opportunity for her to flesh out the details before an audience of tens of millions – although she will have to do so while under rhetorical fire from her Republican opponent. This opportunity is not without risks, however, as Harris could define herself – and her positions – in ways that damage her electoral prospects. She has struggled in the past with answering pointed questions under pressure, and her reluctance to sit for media interviews in the opening weeks of her campaign has denied her the opportunity to hone her linguistic chops. Although she has tried to present herself as the change candidate in this election, the moderators – and the former president – are likely to press her to defend the Biden administration’s record, particularly on areas where polls show Democrats are weak, such as border security and inflation. She will also have to explain why she has renounced some of the more liberal policies she embraced during her unsuccessful bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. She recently has walked back her positions on a fracking ban, decriminalising border crossing and nationalising health insurance, among others. She has explained these changes as ones made to reflect new circumstances  – but they may be viewed by some voters as moves born of political expediency. For Trump, the debate presents an opportunity to wrest back the initiative in this campaign after a month where the Democrats – with their new nominee and high-energy convention – dominated political headlines. He has a history of thriving in the spotlight and setting the terms of political conversation that keeps his opponents off-balance and his issues – notably on immigration and trade, where his positions have broad popular support – at the forefront of political discussion. The former president has his own potential pitfalls on Tuesday, however. His uneven performance during his June debate with Biden drew little scrutiny because of his opponent’s sometimes catastrophic verbal miscues. Harris is sure to present a more nimble opponent, and his answers will have to be sharper. During a New York economic forum last week, he was unable to offer a clear explanation for his childcare policies. Such verbal meandering during the debate will provide Democrats with a wealth of campaign fodder. Trump must also tread carefully when sparring with the vice-president – only the second woman presidential nominee and the first of colour. If he comes across as domineering or belittling, he could further damage his already weak support among female voters.  The two candidates have used markedly different ways of preparing for Tuesday night’s event. The vice-president – and former prosecutor - has been in Pittsburgh, a few hours' drive west of Philadelphia, holding mock debates and reviewing her policy proposals. The move also allowed her to campaign and benefit from some local media coverage in the largest and most crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump - who has participated in presidential debates in each of the past three elections - has held more informal sessions, including reviewing his positions on key issues. Last week, he participated in a town hall forum hosted by conservative cable network Fox News. Tuesday, then, is set to be a contrast of styles as well as political views. Although election day won’t arrive until November, early voting is set to begin this month in some key battleground states – including in pivotal Pennsylvania. So while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8y27dwgpo,Laura Loomer: Who is conspiracy theorist travelling with Trump?,"She joined Trump at an event on Wednesday, and travelled to the presidential debate the day before on his plane.",14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The presence of hard-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer alongside Donald Trump on the campaign trail in recent days has raised questions, including from some Republicans, about the influence the controversial former congressional candidate may have on him. Ms Loomer is well-known for her anti-Muslim rhetoric and for spreading conspiracy theories, including that the 9/11 attacks were an ""inside job"" carried out by the US government.  She joined Trump at an event on Wednesday commemorating the attacks, raising eyebrows and prompting outrage in some US media outlets.  And on Tuesday, the 31-year-old travelled to Philadelphia on board Trump's plane for the presidential debate in the city. Perhaps the most memorable moment of that debate came when Trump repeated a baseless claim that illegal immigrants from Haiti have been eating domestic pets in a small Ohio city. ""They are eating the pets of the people that live there,"" he said. City officials later told BBC Verify that there have been “no credible reports"" this has actually happened.  Trump said he was repeating claims he had heard on television, but the theory was aired by Ms Loomer just a day before the debate. On Monday, the fringe pundit and social media influencer repeated the claims to her 1.2m followers on X. While the level of access Ms Loomer has to Trump is unclear, and his running mate JD Vance has also spread the baseless theory, Ms Loomer's post and her presence in Philadelphia has led some Republicans to blame her for the former president making the unfounded claim on stage. An anonymous source close to the Trump campaign told US news outlet Semafor that they were ""100%"" concerned about Ms Loomer's proximity to Trump.  “Regardless of any guardrails the Trump campaign has put on her, I don’t think it’s working,” the source was quoted as saying.  A number of senior Republican politicians have also publicly criticised Ms Loomer and cautioned against Trump bringing her into his inner circle.  ""Laura Loomer is a crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage intended to divide Republicans,"" North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  ""A DNC [Democratic National Committee] plant couldn't do a better job than she is doing to hurt President Trump's chances of winning re-election,"" Mr Tillis added.  Speaking at a news conference in California on 13 September, Trump said only that Ms Loomer is ""a supporter"" and that he was unaware of recent comments she made about Harris, or her comments about 9/11.  “I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit,"" he added Ms Loomer did not respond to several requests for comment from the BBC.  But on Twitter/X, she said that she operates ""independently"" to help Trump, who she referred to as ""truly our nation's last hope"".  ""To the many reporters who are calling me and obsessively asking me to talk to them today, the answer is no,"" she wrote.  ""I am very busy working on my stories and investigations and don’t have time to entertain your conspiracy theories.""  Born in Arizona in 1993, the self-styled investigative journalist has worked as an activist and commentator for organisations including Project Veritas and Alex Jones's Infowars.  In 2020, she ran  - with Trump's support - as a Republican candidate for the US House of Representatives in Florida, but lost to Democrat Lois Frankel.  She tried again two years later, when she unsuccessfully ran to unseat Representative Daniel Webster in a Republican primary in a different Florida district.  Now, she is known for her vocal support of Trump and for promoting a long string of conspiracy theories including claims that Kamala Harris is not black, and that the son of billionaire George Soros was sending cryptic messages calling for Trump's assassination.  These posts led her to be banned from a number of platforms including Facebook, Instagram and even, according to her, Uber and Lyft for making offensive comments about Muslim drivers. She once described herself as a “proud Islamophobe”. Ms Loomer frequently attends events in support of Trump and has been seen previously at his Florida residence Mar-a-Lago.  Earlier this year, she travelled on his plane to Iowa where she was given a shout-out by him on stage at an event. “You want her on your side,"" Trump said. The former president has also shared several of her videos on Truth Social. And last year, the New York Times reported that Trump had expressed an interest in hiring her for his campaign, relenting only after top aides expressed concern that she could damage his electoral efforts.  “Everyone who works for him thinks she’s a liability,” one Trump aide said of Ms Loomer in a report in NBC News in January. Another outspoken Trump supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene, took issue with Ms Loomer this week over her comments questioning Harris's race and a post in which she said the White House ""will smell like curry"" if Harris - who is partly of Indian descent - is elected. Greene said Ms Loomer's comments were ""appalling and extremely racist"" and did ""not represent who we are as Republicans or MAGA"" - prompting a flurry of furious messages in her direction. This feud in Trump's orbit played out just a day after Ms Loomer appeared at events with Trump commemorating the anniversary of 9/11 in New York and Pennsylvania.  Asked about her attendance there by the Associated Press, she said she did not work for the campaign and was ""invited as a guest""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nd82zmlpo,Consultation over plans to change ward boundaries,The plans would see the number of wards cut by one and boundaries changed.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A consultation has begun on changing council ward boundaries in North East Lincolnshire. The Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) is proposing the number of councillors would remain the same at 42, but the number of wards could be reduced by one to 14. The public is being asked for their views on the proposals over the next few weeks. Any changes would come into force for the next round of local elections in May 2026. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Professor Colin Mellors, chair of the LGBCE, said the consultation would help the commission produce wards which ""reflect local communities and identities"". “By telling us about where you live and where you access local services, it will help us to create appropriate and meaningful boundaries,"" he said. It might be something as straightforward as where you go for shops, schools or a sporting venue, whether you see a road, park or river as a dividing feature or the heart of a community, or which areas have joint projects. “Hearing from local residents will give us important evidence to inform our recommendations for a pattern of wards for North East Lincolnshire that ensures each councillor represents about the same number of electors.” Currently, there are 12 three-member and three two-member wards. If adopted, the changes would mean the council would have 14 three-member wards. The election model would remain the same, with about a third of councillors being elected in three of every four years. Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wj9qejrpwo,What the world thought of US debate,"How the Harris-Trump debate was seen from Putin's Kremlin, Ukraine's frontlines and Taliban-run Afghanistan.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The first showdown between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was closely watched not only in the US but around the world. The debate in Philadelphia featured some tense exchanges on foreign policy between the two presidential candidates. From Beijing to Budapest, here's how the debate went down, according to BBC foreign correspondents. By Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor, Moscow Kamala Harris told Donald Trump that President Putin is “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.” The expression ""to eat someone for lunch"" (or breakfast, or any other meal) doesn’t exist in Russian. But one thing you will find in Moscow is the appetite for a US election result that benefits Russia. The Kremlin will have noted (with pleasure) that in the debate Trump sidestepped the question about whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. “I want the war to stop,” replied Trump. By contrast, Harris spoke of Ukraine’s “righteous defence” and accused Vladimir Putin of having “his eyes on the rest of Europe”. Later the Kremlin claimed to have been irked by all mentions of Putin in the debate. “Putin’s name is used as one of the instruments for the internal battle in the US,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told me. ""We don’t like this and hope they will keep our president’s name out of this.” Last week Putin claimed he was backing Harris in the election and praised her “infectious laugh.” Later a Russian state TV anchor clarified that Putin had been “slightly ironic” in his comments. The presenter was dismissive of Harris’ political skills and suggested she would be better off hosting a TV cooking show. I wonder: would it feature “dictators” eating US presidential candidates “for lunch""…? By Nick Beake, Europe correspondent, Kyiv Donald Trump’s failure, when asked on the debate stage to say if he wanted Ukraine to win the war, may not have surprised people here but it adds to their worry about what a second Trump term would bring. Trump has long boasted he could end in the conflict in 24 hours, a prospect many Ukrainians assume would mean an incredibly bad deal with Kyiv forced to give up huge swathes of the land Russia has seized over the past two and a half years. In contrast, Ukrainians will have been reassured by Kamala Harris’s responses, with no sign she would deviate from the current position of staunch American support. She took credit for the role she’s already played, arguing she shared important intelligence with President Zelensky in the days before the full-scale invasion. She then claimed Trump’s position would have been fatal for Ukraine had he still been in the White House. “If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.” Publicly, there has been a deafening silence from Ukraine’s current ministers and senior military in reaction to the debate. The figurative US electoral battle is one they need not weigh in to while they’re consumed by real fighting at home. It’s President Zelensky himself who so far has gone furthest in articulating, albeit somewhat euphemistically, what a Trump victory would mean for Ukrainians. Speaking to the BBC in July, he said it would mean “hard work, but we are hard workers”. By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent America’s longest war ended in August 2021 when it scrambled to pull out the last of its troops, and evacuate thousands of civilians, as the Taliban swept into Kabul with surprising speed. That debacle made it into the debate and, not surprisingly, the issues were dodged, dismissed, distorted. Harris veered away from the question “do you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?”. As a correspondent who followed the chaotic pullout closely, I never heard that the vice-president was in the room when decisions were taken in those final fateful weeks. But she made it clear she agreed with President Biden’s decision to leave. Trump boasted that he talked tough with “Abdul”, the “head of the Taliban” who is “still the head of the Taliban.” He seemed to be referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the withdrawal deal with the US. But he never headed the Taliban, and has been sidelined since the Taliban takeover. The mention immediately prompted a wave of internet memes featuring “Abdul” with people named Abdul weighing in, and others asking “who is Abdul?” Both contenders focused on the flawed deal with the Taliban. The truth is that the Trump team negotiated this exit plan; the Biden team hastily enacted it. Trump said the deal was good because “we were getting out”. There were no good ways to go. But the departure turned into a disaster and all sides are to blame. By Laura Bicker, China correspondent, Beijing Kamala Harris was an unknown quantity to leaders here and she still is, even after the debate. She has no track record on China and on the debate stage she simply repeated her line that the US, not China, would win the competition for the 21st Century. The vice-president represents something China does not like - uncertainty. That is why President Xi recently used a visit by US officials to call for “stability” between the two superpowers, perhaps a message to the current vice-president. The prevailing view among Chinese academics is that she will not stray too far from President Biden’s slow and steady diplomatic approach. But on the debate stage she went on the attack and accused Donald Trump of “selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernise their military”. Donald Trump has made it clear he plans has to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This will add to the tariffs he imposed as president which started a trade war in 2018. China retaliated, and numerous studies suggest this caused economic pain for both sides. This is the last thing China wants right now as it is trying to manufacture and export goods to rescue its economy. For Chinese leaders, this debate will have done little to assuage beliefs that Trump represents something else they don’t like - unpredictability. But in truth, there is little hope here that US policy on China will change significantly, no matter who sits in the White House. By Paul Adams, international correspondent, Jerusalem The two candidates did not stray much from their previously stated positions last night, even if Trump did add, with characteristic hyperbole, that Israel wouldn’t exist in two years if his opponent becomes president. Here in the Middle East, the race for the White House is being keenly watched. With the war in Gaza raging and a ceasefire deal still elusive, some of Benjamin Netanyahu’s critics suspect that Israel’s prime minister is deliberately stalling until after the election, in the hope that Trump will be more sympathetic to Israel than Harris. There’s a whiff of history perhaps being about to repeat itself. In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s campaign team was suspected of urging Iran not to release American hostages held in Tehran until after he had beaten President Jimmy Carter, saying Reagan would give Iran a better deal. Could something similar be afoot now? Certainly Netanyahu’s opponents believe he is now the chief obstacle to a ceasefire deal. Harris has indicated that she might be tougher on Israel than Joe Biden, something Trump has seized on, saying last night that the vice-president “hates Israel”. Palestinians, deeply sceptical about Donald Trump but dismayed by the Biden administration’s inability to stop the war in Gaza, are possibly inclined to see Harris as the lesser of two evils. They’ve long since abandoned any notion of the US as an honest broker in the Middle East, but will have noticed that Harris, unlike Trump, says she’s committed to Palestinian statehood. By Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent, Budapest Donald Trump showered praise on the Hungarian prime minister. ""Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men, they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart..."" Hungarian pro-government media picked up on the compliment. ""Huge recognition!"" ran the headline in Magyar Nemzet. But government-critical news portal 444 quoted Tim Walz, running mate of Harris. ""He [Trump] was asked to name one world leader who was with him, and he said Orban. Dear God. That's all we need to know.’ Viktor Orban backed Trump for president in 2016 and is strongly backing him again in November.  The two men met for the second time this year at Trump’s home in Florida on 12 July, after Orban visited Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in quick succession. The Orban government is banking both on Trump’s victory and his ability to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. ""Things are changing. If Trump comes back, there will be peace. It will be established by him without the Europeans,"" Balazs Orban, Viktor Orban’s political director, told the BBC in July."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8jg11ynj7o,Why 'Comrade Kamala' memes are spreading among Latino exiles,The Democratic presidential nominee has been the target of misinformation portraying her as a communist.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In Latino exile communities across the US, a question is being asked: is Kamala Harris really a communist? The vice-president has been the subject of numerous misleading claims that she is a socialist or communist since becoming the Democratic candidate for president, according to the US’s largest Spanish-language fact-checker Factchequeado. Experts say these claims capitalise on genuine fears held by some voters who fled repression in countries like Cuba and Venezuela. In one viral video, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz appear to pose for a selfie in front of a  sign for Revolutionary Communists of America, a far-left group. The video is fake. The background was doctored by a group of Donald Trump’s supporters known as the Dilley Meme Team. Their original post had more than 420,000 views, but it was shared by many Spanish accounts - and repeated offline. “It’s everywhere, this doubt: ‘Is this person a communist?’” Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a cultural context strategist from south Florida, told the BBC. She was listening to the Spanish-language radio station La Nueva Poderosa in Miami when she heard the hosts discussing the false meme. “Did you see them standing in front of that picture? They have no shame in who they are,” the hosts said. She contacted the station to express concern. The hosts later said on air that they wanted to clarify the story was “not true” but that “doesn’t take away from the reality that Kamala is a Marxist”. There are nearly 36.2 million eligible Latino voters in America, about 14.7% of the US electorate, and many live in key swing states like Nevada and Arizona, which makes them a coveted demographic for both campaigns. They are by no means a homogeneous voting demographic, but historically, Latinos have tended to favour the Democrats. In 2020, 59% voted for Joe Biden, with only 38% voting for Trump. But polls suggest Republicans have gained ground this election cycle, with many factors cited including the economy, immigration, and abortion rights. And for some immigrants, concerns about America today reflect their past experiences in their home countries. Political messages warning about “socialism” or “communism” have been particularly prevalent in communities with large Cuban and Venezuelan populations, like in south Florida, experts noted. These expats are especially vulnerable to misinformation about communism because of the trauma they experienced fleeing repression, said Samantha Barrios, a Venezuelan-American based in Miami, Florida, who votes Democrat. She accused right-leaning Spanish media of using these terms to “scare Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans” because of “the main reason that we left our countries, trying to leave these regimes”. For some, their criticism of the Democrats is grounded in opinions that the US government has not provided a tough enough response to political repression in Cuba or Venezuela. But Ms Barrio is wary of the way these legitimate concerns are being weaponised through false claims that Kamala Harris herself is a communist. Ms Pérez-Verdía agrees, but she also criticised the Democrat campaign for not doing enough to address their concerns. “Don’t laugh off people’s fears. It’s really disrespectful. People have genuine fears, they came to the United States, they left everything behind. If they have doubts you should address their doubts.” Not all claims exclusively target Latinos, said the Digital Democracy Institute of the Americas (DDIA), which monitors more than 1,300 WhatsApp groups and more than 200 Telegram channels in Spanish and Portuguese. And notable right-wing and pro-Trump actors and influencers have pushed a “fear of socialism” since 2020, the organisation found. But while Joe Biden was accused of being a communist when he ran for president, Factchequeado’s founder, Laura Zommer, said their fact checkers had “never” seen this volume of AI and doctored images before. Some of this misinformation has been spread by Trump himself, or his high-profile supporters. Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, posted a faked image of Kamala Harris in a red uniform emblazoned with the communist hammer and sickle, captioned “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?” It had more than 83.9 million views. A reverse image search suggests this was the earliest posting of the image on X. Donald Trump shared an AI image of Harris addressing a communist crowd that had at least 81.5 million views on X, but it was not the first posting of this image. Posts linking Harris to communism really took off online after the presidential debate, according a report by the DDIA prepared for the BBC. During the debate, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris and her father a “Marxist” and suggested she would turn the US into “Venezuela on steroids” through her immigration policies. After the debate, “Marxista” trended on social media and searches for ""Marxist"" on Google in the US jumped 1000% in 17 hours. Factchequeado said the most searched question in Spanish after the debate was: ""Who is Kamala Harris’s father?"" The DDIA said two claims especially gained traction in the week after the presidential debate. In one, a fabricated document falsely claiming Kamala Harris is a member of the Russian communist party went viral, according to Meta’s own metrics. Another claim, that Harris is “Kamarada [Comrade] Kamala”, arose from a Trump speech in which he portrays her as a “communist comrade”. BBC Verify traced the membership card image to a website which allows people to make fake communist party documents.  The membership number, stamp and other details on the card were identical to a template on the site for making a party membership card.  Posts sharing the fake image, which was first shared in August, have been viewed more than half a million times. The Democratic Party is not a socialist party, nor does it claim to support communist regimes. But some high-profile members like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have described their political views as “democratic socialist”. When she was a California senator, Harris co-sponsored Sanders’ Medicare for All bill, which would have brought a single-payer health care system to the US. She has since said she no longer supports a single-payer health-care system, which would have abolished private insurers. She has never advocated for communist policies, such as the abolition or seizure of private property. Kamala Harris’s plan to crackdown on “price gouging” at supermarkets has been cited in Spanish social media posts as “communist”. Mr Musk claimed it would mean “empty shelves, just like in Venezuela”. Her proposal, which would involve asking the trade commission to investigate price spikes far above the increase in the cost of production, is a far cry from the widespread price controls seen in Cuba and Venezuela that were in part blamed for severe food shortages. But for some voters who fled those countries, their fear lies in anything they feel remotely resembles policies from the countries they came from. Duke Machado, who runs a Latino Republican Facebook page from Texas called Latino Strikeforce, said he fears that if the Democrats win, the country would be on a slippery slope to communism. “If we’re not careful, we’ll slide into Cuba and Venezuela. Their ultimate goal is to destroy capitalism."" When asked if it was responsible to share fears that the Democrats could turn the US into a communist country with his followers, including Latino exiles who had fled repression, he said: “It’s not irresponsible at all. I see it as a duty.” With additional reporting by Kayleen Devlin from BBC Verify North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o,French left protests over new PM Barnier,The new PM has met President Macron and embarked on the task of forming a government.,7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Protests are taking place in France against the appointment of Michel Barnier as the country’s new prime minister. The demonstrations were called by parties on the political left, whose candidate for prime minister was rejected by President Emmanuel Macron. Mr Macron chose the former EU Brexit negotiator 60 days after parliamentary elections left France in political deadlock, with three powerful blocs - of which the left was the largest - but none able to form a majority in the National Assembly. In a televised interview, Mr Barnier - himself from the centre right - said he was open to forming a government including members of the left.  However, Mr Barnier's survival may depend on the votes of the far-right party, although they have made clear they will not join his government. The premier began forming a government a day after he took office, following a meeting with Mr Macron. After talks with the leaders of the right-wing Republicans and the president's centrist Ensemble group, he said discussions were going very well and were ""full of energy"". In a TV interview on Friday evening, Mr Barnier, 73, said he was willing to select ministers from across the political spectrum, including “people from the left”. Parties of the left, however, are angry that their candidate for prime minister, Lucie Castets, was rejected by Mr Macron because she had no chance of surviving a vote of confidence in the national Assembly. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a veteran firebrand from the radical France Unbowed party, has called for marches across France and for the ""most powerful mobilisation possible"". Some unions and youth groups have said they will take part. ""We have a prime minister completely dependent on National Rally,"" said Ms Castets who complained that she, like millions of French voters, felt betrayed and that the president had in effect ended up governing with the far right. Entering the prime minister's residence on Friday evening, Mr Barnier promised to address ""the challenges, the anger, the suffering, the feeling of abandonment, of injustice running through many of our cities, suburbs and rural areas"". He told the TF1 channel that as prime minister, he would address national issues including pension reform, migration and the country’s economic situation. Ex-prime minister Gabriel Attal, whose centrist bloc came second in the election, said after talks with Mr Barnier that Ensemble was prepared to join a broad front with the republican right and republican left, with ""no desire to block or offer unconditional support"". Mr Barnier himself comes from the Republicans, and party leader Laurent Wauquiez  said his decision depended on the prime minister's plans: ""For the moment, nothing has been decided."" Some on the left said it was their own fault they ended up with Mr Barnier as prime minister. Socialist Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo pointed out that the president had considered former Socialist prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, for the job but that he had been turned down by his own party.  Another Socialist mayor, Karim Bouamrane, blamed intransigence from other parts of the left alliance: ""The path they chose was 100% or nothing - and here we are with nothing."" National Rally leaders Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already stressed they will not join the Barnier government, but will wait and see what policies he brings to parliament before they decide on a vote of confidence. The left are threatening a vote of confidence but, without the backing of the far right, will not be able to bring Mr Barnier down. ""He's a man who has never gone too far when he's spoken about National Rally; he's never cast us out - he's a man for discussion,"" said Marine Le Pen, indicating they could allow him to continue in office. Without her party's backing, Mr Barnier would not be able to muster the 289 votes in the 577-seat Assembly, simply by relying on the support of the centrists and the Republicans."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lzly212do,RFK wins bid to remove name from ballot in two swing states,"Robert Kennedy Jr's challenges succeed in Michigan and North Carolina, but he's dealt a setback in Wisconsin.",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has succeeded in having his name removed from ballots in two key swing states, a month after suspending his longshot presidential campaign and endorsing Donald Trump. Appeals courts in Michigan and North Carolina just approved Mr Kennedy’s legal bids to strip his name from voting papers in those states. But a judge in Wisconsin rejected Mr Kennedy’s latest attempt to remove his name from ballots in that state. The rulings could make a difference in the tight race between Trump, a Republican, and Kamala Harris, a Democrat, for November’s White House election. Trump celebrated Friday’s legal outcomes during remarks to a police officers' union in Charlotte, North Carolina. “So all of the Bobby people are going to vote for me,” he said. Since he suspended his cash-strapped White House campaign in August as an independent candidate after his polling slumped to 5%, Mr Kennedy has been fighting to take his name off the ballot in key swing states, reversing months of laborious work to get his name on to the ballots. It has already been determined that his name will not appear on ballots in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, three other potentially pivotal swing states. On Friday, North Carolina's Court of Appeals issued an order granting Mr Kennedy’s latest request. The ruling landed hours before state election officials were about to post more than 132,000 absentee ballots. The North Carolina Board of Elections alerted county election officials that the voting papers should not be sent out on Friday. Election officials had argued that millions of ballots had already been printed and it would be too costly to make the change. Under the ruling, ballots must be reprinted without Mr Kennedy's name before they can be redistributed. The case went to the appeals court a day after a county judge in North Carolina denied Mr Kennedy's legal challenge. In Michigan on Friday, an appeals court also ordered that Mr Kennedy's name be removed. Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had argued it was too late to change the ballots. Her office said it planned to appeal against the ruling to the state Supreme Court. But in Wisconsin, a county judge dealt a setback to Mr Kennedy, ruling that a full court hearing must be held before his name might be removed from ballots. According to Wisconsin law, ""any person who files nomination papers and qualifies to appear on the ballot may not decline nomination”. The judge set a hearing on the matter for 11 September, a week before absentee ballots are sent out."

Greasley Parish Council faces being dissolved and split between neighbouring parishes as part of a ""community governance review"" being conducted by Broxtowe Borough Council. Independent parish councillor Andrew Waterhouse said the move ""feels like a hostile takeover"". Broxtowe Borough Council said no final decision had been made. The review is aimed at ensuring parishes are viable and ""reflect the identities and interests of the community in the area"". Broxtowe Borough Council recommended the change in May, but the plans are currently out for consultation. Mr Waterhouse raised concerns about what it could mean for the future of parish-owned facilities such as the Greasley Sports and Community Centre. ""I worry that we give up our assets and it's transferred away from our control to another council that probably doesn't share our passion and understand how it works,"" he said. Parish council vice-chairman and Conservative Party member Ron Jones described the process as ""undemocratic and immoral"". ""It's pure opportunism on the behalf of Broxtowe council to take over facilities they haven't got,"" he said. Campaigners said a petition opposing the parish's abolition had gained more than 850 signatures. Resident David Derbyshire said he was worried about the prospect of the sports centre being run by others. ""It's incredibly well maintained and incredibly well run,"" he added.  ""It is just a complete surprise as to why somebody would want to come and mess with that,"" he said. Others expressed concerns about the possible impact on the local green belt. Retired finance worker Gillian Powell has lived in the area for 50 years and called the proposal ""dreadful"". ""I don't see why we should be taken over by an urban council when we're rural,"" she said. A spokesperson for Broxtowe Borough Council said: ""This recommendation is currently out for consultation that ends in October 2024, and only after consideration of all submissions received, will a final decision be made."" A final decision is expected later this year, with any changes to parishes due to be in place for elections in 2027. Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on  X, or on Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx28v1vpro,US accuses Russia of 2024 election interference,US charges Russian media executives and alleges state broadcaster RT has paid Tennessee-based firm millions to pump out propaganda.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US has charged and sanctioned Russian state media executives and restricted Kremlin-linked broadcasters as it accused Moscow of a widespread campaign to interfere with the presidential election. The justice, state and treasury departments announced coordinated actions on Wednesday to ""aggressively counter"" the alleged operations. Attorney General Merrick Garland accused state broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today, of paying a Tennessee firm $10m to ""create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging"". RT boss Margarita Simonyan was one of 10 people sanctioned for alleged attempts to harm ""public trust in our institutions"". RT denied involvement.  Mr Garland said that Moscow wanted to secure a ""preferred outcome"" in the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that Russia's programme was aimed at ""reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters here in the US"". A Treasury official meanwhile said that RT and other Russian state media had engaged in a ""nefarious campaign to covertly recruit unwittingly American influencers in support of their malign activity"". The Biden administration's response so far includes: Much of the Kremlin's disinformation effort is directed and funded by RT, Mr Kirby said. ""RT is no longer just a propaganda arm of the Kremlin,"" he said. ""It's being used to advance covert Russian influence actions."" The state media outlet mocked the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"". ""Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections."" The criminal indictments of Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva do not identify by name the Tennessee-based content creation company they used. But the court filing's description of ""a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues"" matches the self-description carried on the website of an outlet named Tenet Media. Tenet posts thousands of English-language videos on social media, and promotes well-known right-wing commentators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin as its ""talent"". Pool said on Twitter/X that he and other commentators had been ""deceived"" and were themselves victims.  The company has been contacted for comment. US officials warn that a growing number of foreign adversaries have attempted to interfere with its elections since Russia's efforts in 2016. In June, a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government successfully breached Donald Trump's campaign and leaked internal documents. A month later, the Department of Justice announced the seizure of two domain names and the search of nearly 1,000 social media accounts operated by Russian actors to ""create an AI-enhanced social media bot farm that spread disinformation"". Researchers have also uncovered a growing Chinese influence operation aimed at infiltrating and swaying US political conversations on social media. Xi Jinping, China's president, pledged his country would not interfere in the US election during a summit with President Joe Biden last November. Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said on Tuesday that the US could ""absolutely expect... foreign adversaries"" to try to ""undermine American confidence in our democracy... and sow partisan discord"".  ""And that's why it is up to all of us not to let our foreign adversaries be successful."" Eight years ago, Russia conducted a sophisticated campaign that involved hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking stolen documents to Wikileaks with the intent of hurting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Many Democrats argue the operation helped contribute to Trump's eventual victory that November. US politicians and intelligence officials have since concluded that the operation was directly ordered by Vladimir Putin, Russia's president. Twelve Russian military intelligence officers were charged in 2018 with orchestrating the effort, and federal warrants were issued for their arrest."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyne60ln20o,Why this US jobs report matters and what to watch,The report is a key gauge of the US economy - a top issue in the presidential election.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"If you care about where the US economy is headed, you might want to keep an eye on events on Friday. At 08:30 ET (13.30 BST), the US Labor Department will release the results of its monthly jobs surveys of employers and households. The report is one of the most important gauges of the state of the world's largest economy - and it is coming at a critical time. The US presidential campaign, in which voters have identified the economy as a top concern, is under way. And after several years focused on inflation worries, attention is starting to turn to the job market. Last month, the Labor Department reported the unemployment rate had hit 4.3% in July, up from 3.5% a year earlier, as jobs growth slowed. The news helped to fuel several days of stock market turmoil. If Friday's report shows further cracks forming in the job market that would be bad news for Democrats, undermining the story they have been telling of an economy that is healthy, if slowing, and returning to sustainable growth, after a post-pandemic boom.  How much we should worry is still up for debate.  Such an increase in unemployment often signals an economic recession - but forecasters say that prediction is less certain this time, noting factors like a surge in immigration that have complicated the picture.  Other data suggest the rise in unemployment rate has been driven by more people looking for work, rather than a sharp rise in job cuts.  Friday's report will help to flesh out that puzzle, offering a key piece of evidence as voters' impressions start to cement ahead of the November vote.  Republicans have been keen to point to any bad news – a stock market stumble, lower growth figures, slowing business investment and a dip in hiring – as evidence that a change of leadership in Washington is necessary. Part of what has kept Democrats on the defensive about the economy is the unusual mix of forces at play right now.  The US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply two years ago, responding to prices that were jumping at the fastest rate since the 1980s.  The Federal Reserve said the moves - which brought its key lending rate to a roughly two decade high of 5.3% - would help get inflation under control.  But the way they do that is by discouraging business expansions and other big spending and dampening the pressures pushing up prices.  Put more simply, the Fed is deliberately slowing the economy. That often doesn't end well.  Historically, a big jump in rates typically ends in a recession - and the stock market has been jittery over any signs that the economy is headed for a ""hard landing"". Donald Trump has fanned the fears, for months predicting an economic ""crash"" - especially if his opponent is elected. Polls suggest a majority of Americans have already spent much of the last few years believing the economy is in recession - a downbeat assessment at odds with the country's 2.5% growth last year. Many analysts blame the disconnect on inflation, as households balk at prices that have jumped nearly 20% over four years.  But the urgency of that issue has abated, as wages rise and inflation subsides, dropping to 2.9% in the most recent official reading - the slowest pace since March 2021. That has set the stage for the Fed to lower interest rates for the first time in four years, which could bring further financial relief, leading to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other forms of debt. Friday's job report will be key to confirming the timing and size of the cut - and if it is actually likely to end up boosting sentiment and helping Democrats, as expected.  For now, most analysts expect a cut of 0.25 percentage points, which would signal an ongoing, orderly slowdown.  If the figures fuel worries about the economy, however, a bigger cut might be in order - though a cut driven by a stuttering economy and Americans losing jobs would hardly prove a benefit to Democrats.  Conversely, booming jobs numbers might make the bank rethink whether the economy is still running too hot and a cut is necessary at all.  That has left the Harris campaign in a peculiar position - hoping for a good jobs report, but not a great one.  In a closely watched speech last month, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell left his options for how big a cut might be on the table.  Friday's jobs report may start closing some doors. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq53wvpe5xo,Undecided Americans impressed by Harris - but did debate shift their votes?,We spoke to eight voters who see the debate as crucial in determining who they will support in November.,12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"With only weeks left until the US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are in a battle to win the support of those who are yet to commit to either candidate. The BBC has spoken to eight undecided voters who saw Tuesday night's 90-minute debate as being crucial in working out who to pick in November's ballot. Vanessa was leaning towards voting for Trump before the debate started and is still leaning that way, but was impressed with Harris's performance.  I don't think the debate changed my opinion on voting for Trump, but I definitely am less fearful if [Harris] wins because I think she can handle herself and debate well. I'm overall unchanged, but I like her better now.  I lost a lot of faith in the Democratic Party when they told us Joe Biden was fine, and then it turns out he's not, and so it's hard to trust that same administration going forward.  I do not want to vote for Trump, but I do not like this current administration. I won't change my mind before November, I'd just be less worried if she were to win.  Jeremy doesn't like Trump and didn't vote Democrat in 2016 or 2020, but after tonight's debate says he will be voting for Harris.  Tonight was the first night where genuinely, I would say I felt, like, scared at the prospect of a second Trump presidency.  His answers where he would fearmonger about immigrants killing dogs, fearmonger about World War III multiple times. Every time he spoke, it was frightening to a level that I have not felt from him before.  And while I don't love Harris, and I think she's very wishy-washy, she does not pose an existential threat to America like he does.  Tracy watched the debate but remains undecided over who she will vote for. I thought both candidates spoke fairly well, but I thought Kamala answered more of the questions than Trump did.  I had never really seen anything about [Harris] so I was looking for basically an opinion on her. So I was rather pleased with some of what she had to say and actually what ex-President Trump had to say, but I get a very shifty vibe from him.  I don't trust [Trump]. I don't think he wants to run the country, I think he wants to own the country. Mat was considering skipping the election all together, but after the debate he says he has made up his mind.  The debate was something.  Kamala Harris definitely did very well. I think Trump kind of did not. He lost his focus and kept rambling on where it was kind of incoherent.  After last night, I think I'll vote for Kamala Harris. I don't know if I'll be very enthusiastic about it but I will probably be voting for her.  There's still a little bit of time until November, but she very likely has my vote. Kimberly hasn't been attracted to either of the major party candidates, but after the debate she is leaning towards supporting Harris.  If I could vote for no one, I probably would do that. I want to get the full facts before I do anything. [I was] not impressed with Trump, I won't be voting for him.  William thought the debate conveyed a clear picture of both candidates, but says he is leaning towards Harris after watching. Trump was all over the place. He was lured into a lot of questions that he should have answered perfectly like immigration and abortion, but he was caught off guard with statements about crowd size, which was really revealing.  I felt like Kamala was far more prepared for this than Donald Trump.  I personally want to see her in more one-on-one interviews after this, this is the first time I'm seeing her without Tim Walz and she did fine, in my opinion.  If she went out there more, spoke to the nation one-on-one more, she'd receive my vote at that point.  Rohan remains undecided, but says after the debate he's 51% for Harris and 49% for Trump. Still, he says, there's still time for that to change.  The debate did very little to change my perspective of Trump. This was more an audition for Kamala Harris to just kind of see who she is, where she stands on policies and her command of the stage.  She came across pretty rehearsed to me, but she dropped a lot of, sort of, baited statements that I think Trump bit on really hard - rattled him a bit, made him pretty angry.  All of this seemed pretty calculated to me, and that's not exactly what I was looking for out of her. I was looking for her to be a little more personable, a little more natural.  Chance wasn't very impressed with the debate performances and still remains undecided.  I didn't feel like the topics were discussed in depth, it was mostly the candidates talking at each other.  I was disappointed, really.  I personally wished they would go in depth about their policy, instead of attacking the other person for something about their policy.  I'm personally not a fan of either of them, but if I was going to choose one or the other, I would probably choose Harris.   John Sudworth contributed to this report. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9l9500vg7o,Trump rules out another presidential debate against Harris,"Two days after the pair's first showdown, the Republican says his Democratic rival only wants a rematch because he won.",13 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has ruled out another presidential debate against his rival Kamala Harris before November's election.  He said on Thursday - two days after the pair's first showdown in Philadelphia - that Harris only wanted a rematch because he ""clearly"" won. Several instant polls taken after Tuesday's contest indicated voters felt Harris had performed better than her Republican opponent. Trump added that Harris should instead ""focus"" on her job as vice-president. Shortly after, at a campaign rally in North Carolina, Harris responded by saying they ""owe"" voters another debate because ""what is at stake could not be more important"". Polls suggest the two candidates are in an extremely tight race with just two months to go before the election. Both claimed victory after Tuesday's 90-minute debate on ABC News, in which Harris rattled Trump with a string of personal attacks that put him on the defensive. These included comments about the size of his rally crowds and his conduct during the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol. Trump and his supporters have since accused the two ABC journalists that moderated the debate of being unfair and biased in favour of Harris. He said on Thursday that he did not need another debate. ""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are 'I want a rematch',"" Trump wrote in a lengthy Truth Social post on Thursday. ""Polls clearly show that I won the debate against comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats' radical left candidate... and she immediately called for a second debate,"" he added.  The former president held a rally in Arizona on Thursday and gave an interview with Telemundo Arizona backstage. ""We just don't think it's necessary,"" he said of a second debate with Harris. ""We think we've discussed everything and I don't think they want it either."" The Harris campaign, however, called for a second debate immediately after Philadelphia and continued to do so on Thursday. They said voters ""got to see the choice they will face at the ballot box: moving forward with Kamala Harris or going backwards with Trump"". ""Vice-President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?"" the campaign said. Speaking after the debate, various Trump campaign surrogates - including Florida Republican Representative Matt Gaetz - said they believed Trump would welcome another debate. However, Trump said on Fox News the following morning that the debate had been ""rigged"" and that he was ""less inclined"" to attend another after his ""great night"". His decision on Thursday also appeared to contradict earlier messaging from his own campaign. On Wednesday morning, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, told CNN that Trump “has already said that he is going to do three debates"". Both campaigns had reportedly been in discussions over a debate on NBC News on 25 September. The network has not commented on Trump's latest statement. Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee -  an organisation that has advised the Harris-Walz campaign on economic messaging - told the BBC that Trump's decision was a ""double favour"" to the Harris campaign.  ""Voters will have a lasting impression of Kamala Harris as looking presidential and standing on their side,"" he said. ""That will probably do her very well.""  ""Another debate would potentially help Harris, but could also shake up the existing glow that surrounds her,"" Mr Green added.  Jeremy Petersen, an independent voter from Utah, told the BBC that he was not surprised by Trump's decision.  ""If [Trump] doesn't feel like he can score some social media soundbites, there's no benefit for him to show up,"" said Mr Petersen, who added that he would probably support Harris after the Philadelphia debate.  ""He felt that Harris wouldn't have the type of performance she did and now he's running scared,"" Mr Petersen added. ""He can't stop her momentum via debate so he needs a new angle."" Televised debates date back to 1960, when John F Kennedy faced off against Richard Nixon.  There are traditionally two or three presidential debates happening in most election cycles, along with at least one vice-presidential debate. That tradition, however, was upended in July, when Joe Biden withdrew from the election weeks after a disastrous performance against Trump in the first debate.  The subsequent debate between Harris and Trump followed weeks of back and forth over whether it would go ahead, and under what conditions.  Trump previously suggested additional debates on Fox and NBC News, although Harris only agreed to ABC. In his Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump said his rival ""refused"" to do the additional debates.  Statistics from media analytics firm Nielsen show that 67.1m people watched the debate, a significantly higher figure than the 51.3m who tuned into the June debate between Trump and Biden.  Polls suggest Harris and Trump are in an extremely tight race in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Thursday indicated Harris had a five-point lead over Trump nationally, while 53% of respondents said that she won Tuesday's debate.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn7n4eyy8o,Voters 'should get a choice' on Reform defectors,A council's Tory group leader says by-elections should be held after two members quit his party.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Two councillors who quit the Conservative Party to join Reform should face by-elections, according to a leading Southend Tory. Tony Cox, the former Conservative leader at Southend-on-Sea City Council, and fellow councillor Darryl Jones announced last week that they were joining Nigel Farage's party. James Courtenay, the new leader of the Conservative group said local residents would be ""disappointed"" to have ended up with Reform councillors when they elected. Mr Cox said by-elections would be expensive and ""if you asked residents, they’d say carry on"". Mr Cox is a councillor in West Shoebury and had been a Conservative Party member for nearly 30 years. He was the council leader until May, when Labour took control and formed an administration with an independent group. Mr Jones, who represents Southchurch ward, joined Mr Cox following a Tory fallout over who should take their local party forward. Speaking to BBC Essex, Mr Courtenay said: ""It's one thing leaving a party and sitting as an independent, but to cross the floor and join another party, I think residents should get a choice. ""The residents of West Shoebury did not elect a Reform councillor; they have consistently returned a Conservative councillor.  ""I think they will be rather disappointed to find they have ended up with a Reform councillor.  ""If I was to join a [different] party, I would stand down and have a by-election because I don’t think it would be fair on the residents of Chalkwell ward, who elected me as a Conservative councillor, to find me in any other party."" In a resignation statement on why he was leaving the Conservatives, Mr Cox said: ""I haven't left the Conservative Party, but they have left me and the people of Southend."" When questioned on whether it was democratic to join another party after an election, he stressed the cost of holding a by-election. Mr Cox added: ""In the days of constrained finances, would the public, who I am still providing support to, think it would be wise to call a by-election which would cost in and around £15,000? ""If you asked residents, they’d say carry on, stay on doing what you do.  ""I have actually said to people, I’m still a conservative, you elected a conservative, the difference is the Conservative Party left me and those residents who voted for a Conservative."" During the general election campaign in June, four Independent councillors in Tendring in north-east Essex decided to join Reform, and were unveiled by party leader Mr Farage during an appearance in Clacton. Reform also has its first councillor on Thurrock Council with former Conservative, Alex Anderson, announcing he has joined the party.  Mr Anderson, who represents Stanford East and Corringham Town, said in a statement he was joining to ""put an end to years of disastrous Labour/Conservative rule"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d9dd8v75no,How Harris campaign is engaging with Swifties,The Harris campaign is hoping that Swift's millions of fans will turn out to vote.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Taylor Swift has just endorsed Kamala Harris – but it’s not just her vote Harris is after, it’s her millions of fans. Weeks before Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris on Instagram, the gears had already begun to turn Swift’s millions of fans into bona-fide Harris voters. Soon after Harris announced her intention to run for president, Irene Kim, 29, who spends as many as 14 hours a day talking to fellow Swifties online and has attended more than five of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour concerts, sprung into action. Along with other mega-fans who supported Harris, they created social media accounts, memes, montages, and newsletters, all in a bid to help their favourite candidate win the election. I’ve been going inside the world of the Swifties ahead of the Presidential vote for the second season of BBC Radio 4’s podcast Why Do You Hate Me USA. Subscribe to the podcast for episodes soon. I’ll be investigating how the online world of social media is shaping the US election. And when it comes to social media, Taylor Swift supporters are considered leaders of the pack. Now the executive director of the Swifties for Kamala campaign, Ms Kim decided to get involved because she wants the US to see its first female president and believes Kamala Harris will  “protect our rights, the rights of our friends, our family members”. With more than 3,500 volunteers, the Swifties for Kamala would seem like an experienced political operation. The group has even raised over $165,000 (£126,000) for the campaign since they began tracking donations from 1 August. But Ms Kim, who says she has never participated in political campaigning like this before, thinks everyone came together in a really “natural” way. They’re using the skills she says they’ve developed - from strategising how to buy tickets for the sold-out Eras tour and auctioning off merchandise like signed Taylor Swift records - to try and swing an election. The Swifties for Kamala group is volunteer-led and independent of the Harris campaign, but they have been in touch. The conversations are “surprisingly more casual than you would expect”, Ms Kim tells me. They aren’t entirely about the online world either - they’re about translating that into real-world action. “They’re [the campaign] helping facilitate things like volunteer sign-ups and helping us coordinate volunteer training,” Ms Kim says. Not just for in-person canvassing but also text and phone banking. “We can make requests. We really wanted a photo of Doug [Kamala’s husband] standing behind Kamala so we could do the like ‘he lets her bejewelled’ joke.”  The BBC reached out to the Harris campaign for comment, but did not get a response.  The online world is a key battleground for both campaigns, and memes and videos from supporters that feel more authentic than paid-for ads could be effective at reaching younger, disengaged voters. The army of Swifties could also be a way for the Harris campaign to go head-to-head with Donald Trump’s already very active base of supporters online. They operate a bit like a fandom too, and have proved effective at pushing out endless memes and pictures for the former president. Endorsements from - for example - tech boss Elon Musk have also sent Musk’s devoted army of followers on X Trump’s way too. All of that keeps Donald Trump at the top of some social media feeds. But that can backfire. In one meme, which the former president shared on social media, an AI generated image of Swift endorsed Trump. In her Instagram post endorsing Kamala Harris, Taylor Swift specifically cited misleading images of her supporting Trump as a reason to speak now. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,” she said in her post, that was liked more than 10.7m times. Although Swift’s endorsement specifically told her fans “your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make”,  Swifties for Kamala is hoping that call to vote will translate into votes for Harris. Ms Kim says the group didn’t know the endorsement was coming, but had planned for it anyway, hoping it would yield a wave of new volunteers. Since the post, it’s been “absolutely madness in the best way”, she says. According to Ms Kim they’ve seen a spike in voter registration activity and a “huge boost on social media” because of the endorsement. She also says it’s been a “huge morale” boost for the Swifties involved in the group. Taylor Swift’s online supporters have a reputation too for being devoted to her whatever it takes - and that can include being ferocious to those they see as her enemies. Will they be trolling Trump supporters? Ms Kim says the group has actually come up with guidelines of their own about this to try to stop it from happening. “They are very specifically about conducting yourself in a way that is respectful and specifically not engaging with hate online. And that also includes not posting hate. Have a respectful conversation,” Irene tells me. There are Swifties too who are Trump, rather than Harris supporters. Some Swifties for Trump accounts have been set up - although currently with fewer followers than Swifties for Kamala. Several profiles belonging to Trump-supporting Taylor Swift fans have posted about her endorsement saying it hasn’t changed their mind about who they’ll vote for. Ms Kim says they want to reach as many voters as possible – and that they hope their shared love of Swift will help them find common ground on Harris. “We don’t want to make anyone feel like they’re isolated or alienated,” she explains. She thinks Swifties for Kamala could be especially useful in reaching “conservative women” who are “now realising the political beliefs they were raised with don’t always align with what they feel and believe”. So, will Swifties affect the presidential race? The group has had hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok, but that doesn’t mean those voters are even based in the US. And they might have been people already planning to vote for Kamala Harris. Nonetheless, in an election that could be decided by just a few hundred thousand votes in a handful of states, any boost in voter registration and voter turnout could tip the scales. Younger voters, who make up the majority of Swift’s fans, have historically had a lower voter turnout, which means that there is more room for gains. Ms Kim thinks Swifties and their social media know-how are a secret weapon. “I never would have imagined this in my wildest dreams. We've had a lot of moments where we've, like taken a step back to be like, I think we're actually making a difference and that's like really cool.” What will happen next? And how is what unfolds in the social media world shaping the US election? Subscribe to Why Do You Hate Me USA on BBC Sounds. Episodes coming soon."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglk9kypn36o,US says Iran sent info from Trump hack to Biden associates,US officials say the info was sent unsolicited and there is no evidence any recipients replied,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Iranian hackers distributed information about Donald Trump's electoral campaign to people linked to the Biden campaign, according to the FBI and US intelligence agencies.  US officials now believe that information taken from the Trump campaign was sent in unsolicited emails to people linked to the campaign in late June and early July - before Biden dropped out of the race for president.  There is currently no evidence that the hackers received any reply from any recipients.   In August, officials warned that Iran hopes to ""stoke discord"" and undermine confidence in US institutions ahead of the November election.  US officials said that Iran had used “social engineering and other efforts” to seek out direct access to both the Democratic and Republican campaigns – a tactic they said had been used by both Iran and Russia in other countries around the world. In a statement released on Wednesday, the FBI said that “Iranian malicious actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump’s campaign to US media organisations"". When contacted by the BBC, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the hack is proof that Iran was ""interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror"". She said Biden and Harris should outline what happened to the material sent to Biden associates. ""What did they know and when did they know it?” Ms Leavitt questioned.  The former president also commented on the hacking on Wednesday, telling supporters that ""they [Iran] gave them all the materials because Biden is working with Iran"".  Morgan Finkelstein, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, said that the campaign has cooperated with authorities since it was made aware of the hacks.  ""We're not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,"" Ms Finkelstein added. ""A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt."" Ms Finkelstein added that it condemns ""in the strongest terms"" any foreign election interference efforts.  The BBC has also contacted the White House for comment.  The FBI statement added that officials have been in contact with the victims of the hack and will continue to investigate in hopes of stopping and disrupting ""the threat actors responsible”. A spokesperson for Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations told CBS - the BBC's US partner - that ""Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the US election; and, it therefore categorically repudiates such accusations"". The announcement comes amid renewed scrutiny of Trump's security, just days after a second apparent assassination attempt was made against him at his golf course in Florida.  Speaking to reporters earlier, Trump addressed the attempt, saying that ""I just have to lead my life"".  ""You don't want to ever be curtailed because of the crazy people out there,"" he added.  After Trump was wounded by a gunman during a 13 July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, US officials said that an Iranian threat on Trump's life had prompted additional security measures.  At a packed rally in Long Island in New York on Wednesday - just a few miles away from where he grew up in Queens - Trump said that ""God spared my life"".  ""Not once, but twice,"" he said to raucous applause from the crowd. ""There are those that say he [God] did it because Trump is going to turn this state around. He's going to turn this country around.""  Supporters at the rally told the BBC they were angry after learning about the second possible attempt after authorities say gunman was found with a rifle at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida as the former president was golfing.  One supporter at the rally, Dina Glazer, said she blamed Democrats and their rhetoric about Trump for the incidents.  The former president “needs more security, which they haven’t done”, she said. Another supporter, Michelle Christ, said she feared Trump was in ""constant danger"". “Some people think their opinion is the most important,” she said. “But you don’t act on those thoughts” violently, she said. The crowd at the rally booed as Trump mentioned Springfield, Ohio, which has been rocked by unfounded claims about its Haitian immigrant community. Trump faced criticism for repeating them during the presidential debates. “Send them back!” One member of the crowd shouted from the back of the arena."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy343z53l1o,What are Harris and Trump's policies?,"Economy, immigration, abortion and other top issues - here is where the two candidates stand.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on different issues. Harris has said her day-one priority would be trying to reduce food and housing costs for working families. She promises to ban price-gouging on groceries, help first-time home buyers and provide incentives to increase housing supply. Trump has promised to “end inflation and make America affordable again”.  He has promised to deliver lower interest rates, something the president does not control, and he says deporting undocumented immigrants will ease pressure on housing. Harris has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and she continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. Trump has struggled to find a consistent message in recent weeks.  The three judges he appointed to the Supreme Court while president were pivotal in overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, a 1973 ruling known as Roe v Wade. Harris was tasked with tackling the root causes of the southern border crisis and helped raise billions of dollars of private money to make regional investments aimed at stemming the flow north. Record numbers of people crossed from Mexico at the end of 2023 but the numbers have fallen since. In this campaign, she has toughened her stance and emphasised her experience as a prosecutor in California taking on human traffickers. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the construction of a wall and increasing enforcement. But he urged Republicans to ditch a hardline, cross-party border bill, backed by Harris. He has also promised the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history. Experts told the BBC this would face legal challenges. Harris wants to raise taxes on big businesses and Americans making $400,000 (£305,000) a year. But she has also unveiled a number of measures that would ease the tax burden on families, including an expansion of child tax credits. Trump proposes a number of tax cuts worth trillions, including an extension of his 2017 cuts which mostly helped the wealthy. He says he will pay for them through higher growth and tariffs on imports. Analysts say both tax plans will add to the ballooning deficit, but Trump’s by more. Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. She has pledged, if elected, to ensure the US and not China wins ""the competition for the 21st Century"". She has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza. Trump has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel but said little on how he would end the war in Gaza. Harris has criticised Trump’s sweeping plan to put tariffs on imports, calling it a national tax on working families which will cost each household $4,000 a year. She is expected to have a more targeted approach to taxing imports. Trump has made tariffs a central pledge in this campaign. He has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods, and much higher ones on those from China. Harris, as vice-president, helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy, and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programmes.  But she has dropped her opposition to fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil opposed by environmentalists. Trump, while in the White House, rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles.  In this campaign he has vowed to expand Arctic drilling and attacked electric cars. Harris has been part of a White House administration which has reduced prescription drug costs and capped insulin prices at $35. Trump has said he will not renew his attempts while president to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people.  He has called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but that could be opposed by Republicans in Congress. Harris has tried to contrast her experience as a prosecutor with the fact Trump has been convicted of a crime.  Trump has vowed to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. Harris has made preventing gun violence a key pledge, and she and Tim Walz - both gun owners - often advocate for tighter laws. But they will find that moves like expanding background checks or banning assault weapons will need the help of Congress. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, the constitutional right to bear arms. Addressing the National Rifle Association in May, he said he was their best friend."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjlxvg2gj7o,Barnier becomes new French PM and bids to end turmoil,The French president names the EU's former Brexit negotiator almost two months after snap elections.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Veteran French conservative Michel Barnier has taken over as prime minister,  almost two months after France's snap elections ended in political stalemate. He said France had come to a ""serious moment"" and he was facing it with humility: ""All political forces will have to be respected and listened to, and I mean all."" President Emmanuel Macron named the EU's former chief Brexit negotiator, ending weeks of talks with political parties and potential candidates.  Mr Barnier, 73, arrived at the prime minister's residence at Hôtel Matignon in Paris on Thursday evening, taking over the role from Gabriel Attal, France's youngest ever prime minister who has been in office for the past eight months. His immediate task will be to form a government that can survive a National Assembly divided into three big political blocs, with none able to form a clear majority. But Mr Barnier will need all his political skills to navigate the coming weeks, with the centre-left Socialists already planning to challenge his appointment with a vote of confidence. He said he would respond in the coming days to the ""challenges, the anger and the sense of being abandoned and of injustice that run through our towns and countryside"". He promised to tell the truth to the French people about the financial and environmental challenges facing the country, and to work with ""all those in good faith"" towards great respect and unity. It has taken President Macron 60 days to make up his mind on choosing a prime minister, having called a ""political truce"" during the Paris Olympics.    In his farewell speech outside Hôtel Matignon, Gabriel Attal said ""French politics is sick, but a cure is possible, provided that we all agree to move away from sectarianism"". Having led the marathon talks on the UK's exit from the European Union between 2016 and 2019, Mr Barnier has considerable experience of political deadlock. He has had a long political career in France as well as the EU and has long been part of the right-wing Republicans (LR) party. Known in France as Monsieur Brexit, he is France's oldest prime minister since the Fifth Republic came into being in 1958.   Three years ago, he tried and failed to become his party's candidate to take on President Macron for the French presidency. He said he wanted to limit and take control of immigration. Mr Macron's presidency lasts until 2027. Normally the government comes from the president's party, as they are elected weeks apart.  But the man who has called himself ""the master of the clocks"" changed that when he called snap elections in June and his centrists came second to the left-wing New Popular Front. President Macron has interviewed several potential candidates for the role of prime minister, but his task was complicated by the need to come up with a name who could survive a so-called censure vote on their first appearance in the National Assembly. The Elysée Palace said that by appointing Mr Barnier, the president had ensured that the prime minister and future government would offer the greatest possible stability and the broadest possible unity. Mr Barnier had been given the task of forming a unifying government ""in the service of the country and the French people"", the presidency stressed. Mr Barnier's initial challenge as prime minister will be to steer through France's 2025 budget and he has until 1 October to submit a draft plan to the National Assembly.  Gabriel Attal has already been working on a provisional budget over the summer, but getting it past MPs will require all Mr Barnier's political skills. His nomination has already caused discontent within the New Popular Front (NFP), whose own candidate for prime minister was rejected by the president. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the radical France Unbowed (LFI) - the biggest of the four parties that make up the NFP - said the election had been ""stolen from the French people"". Instead of coming from the the alliance that came first on 7 July, he complained that the prime minister would be ""a member of a party that came last"", referring to the Republicans. ""This is now essentially a Macron-Le Pen government,"" said Mr Mélenchon, referring to the leader of the far-right National Rally (RN). He then called for people to join a left-wing protest against Mr Macron's decision planned for Saturday. To survive a vote of confidence, Mr Barnier will need to persuade 289 MPs in the 577-seat National Assembly to back his government. Marine Le Pen has made clear her party will not take part in his administration, but she said he at least appeared to meet National Rally's initial requirement, as someone who ""respected different political forces"". Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old president of the RN, said Mr Barnier would be judged on his words, his actions and his decisions on France's next budget, which has to be put before parliament by 1 October. He cited the cost of living, security and immigration as major emergencies for the French people, adding that ""we hold all means of political action in reserve if this is not the case in the coming weeks"". Mr Barnier is likely to attract support from the president's centrist Ensemble alliance. Macron ally Yaël Braun-Pivet, who is president of the National Assembly, congratulated the nominee and said MPs would now have to play their full part: ""Our mandate obliges us to."" The former Brexit negotiator had only emerged as a potential candidate late on Wednesday afternoon. Until then, two other experienced politicians had been touted as most likely candidates: former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve and Republicans regional leader Xavier Bertrand. But it soon became apparent that neither would have survived a vote of confidence. That was Mr Macron's explanation for turning down the left-wing candidate, Lucie Castets, a senior civil servant in Paris who he said would have fallen at the first hurdle.  The president has been widely criticised for igniting France's political crisis. A recent opinion poll suggested that 51% of French voters thought the president should resign. There is little chance of that, but the man Mr Macron picked as his first prime minister in 2017, Édouard Philippe, has now put his name forward three years early for the next presidential election."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdnl9pg1wo,Who won the Harris-Trump presidential debate?,"Trump couldn't resist Harris's personal digs at the debate which threw him off message, writes Anthony Zurcher.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris met for the first time on the presidential debate stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. They may have shaken hands, but they did not hit it off. In a fiery 90 minutes, Harris frequently rattled the former president with personal attacks that threw him off message and raised the temperature of this highly-anticipated contest. Her pointed digs on the size of his rally crowds, his conduct during the Capitol riot, and on the officials who served in his administration who have since become outspoken critics of his campaign repeatedly left Trump on the back foot. The pattern for much of this debate was Harris goading her Republican rival into making extended defences of his past conduct and comments. He gladly obliged, raising his voice at times and shaking his head. Americans should go to a Trump rally, Harris said during an early question about immigration, because they were illuminating. “People start leaving the rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,” she said. That barb clearly rattled the former president, as he then spent most of his answer – on a topic that should have been one of his main areas of strength – defending his rally sizes and belittling hers. Trump went from there to an extended riff on a debunked report that Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating their neighbours’ pets.    If debates are won and lost on which candidate best takes advantage of issues where they are strong - and defends or deflects on areas of weakness - Tuesday night tilted in favour of the vice-president. A snap CNN poll of voters watching said that Harris performed better and betting markets said the same. This is a snapshot that could be momentary but the Harris tactic of putting Trump on the defensive was clear early in the evening when the topics covered were the economy and abortion.  Public opinion surveys indicate many Americans are unhappy with how the Biden administration – of which Harris is a key member – has handled inflation and the economy.   But Harris turned the topic to Trump’s proposed across-the-board tariffs, which she labelled a “Trump sales tax”, and then brought up Project 2025, the controversial independent conservative plan for a future Republican administration. As he has in the past, Trump distanced himself from the project and defended his tariff plan, noting that the Biden administration had kept many of the tariffs in his first presidency. They were valid points, but it kept him from hammering the vice-president on inflation and consumer prices. On abortion, Trump defended his handling of the issue, saying that Americans across the spectrum wanted Roe v Wade abortion protections overturned by the Supreme Court – a statement that polling does not support. He struggled to make his position clear and his answer was at times rambling. Harris, meanwhile, took the opportunity to make an impassioned, personal appeal to families who have faced severe pregnancy complications and have been unable to receive abortion care in states that have banned the procedure – states with “Trump abortion bans”, as she called them. “It’s insulting to the women of America,” she concluded. It was a carefully modulated message in an area in which she has a double-digit advantage over Trump. Time and time again as the evening progressed, Harris put Trump on the defensive with jabs and barbs that he could have ignored but seemingly felt compelled to address. At one point, Harris was asked about the liberal positions, such as those on oil shale fracking, that she took during her failed 2019 presidential campaign and has since abandoned. Her deliberate prodding continued and she ended her answer by noting that she did not take handouts from her wealthy father. Again, the former president took the bait. Instead of hitting the vice-president on her shifting views – a clear area of weakness – he opened his response by talking about the “tiny fraction” of money he took from his father. On the Afghanistan withdrawal, another weak point for Harris, the vice-president shifted the conversation to Trump’s negotiations with Taliban officials and inviting them to Camp David. It was a pattern that played out over and over and proved very effective.  Republicans are already complaining about what they say was the favouritism the ABC moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, showed toward Harris. Both of them pushed back and fact-checked assertions made by Trump on several occasions. In the end, however, it was Trump’s responses and eagerness to take and devour whatever bait Harris set out for him that was the story of the evening. And that played out in the faces of the two candidates. Whenever her opponent was talking, Harris took on a studied look of bemusement or incredulity. Trump, for his part, mostly scowled. Up until now, the Harris campaign had been coy about whether she would agree to another debate. Almost immediately after this one ended, they called for a second presidential debate before November. That alone should indicate how well the Democrats think Tuesday night went for Harris.

The event represents an opportunity for a do-over for both parties and the consensus among voters is clear: they want more policy and less political sparring.  The BBC spoke to voters from across the political spectrum. Here's what seven of them are hoping to see unfold.   A Republican born and raised in Utah, he voted for Mr Biden in the 2020 election but plans to switch to Trump in November.  I'm curious to see what they're both going to do. Kamala Harris has been knocked recently for not doing a lot of interviews and for being underground versus Donald Trump, who usually gets knocked for his style in terms of how he conducts himself during debates and just his loudness.  I've decided I'm going to vote for Trump this time, but I would like to see what the vice-president has to say. I'd like to see how she performs more off the cuff and without an ability to read from the prompter. I want to see how she does with those fast questions interacting with Trump. Even though I'm voting for him, it's not because I'm comfortable with it necessarily. It's really just a style thing. I hope Trump can just stand there and not go all crazy and whatever - just minimise the attacks and focus on policies. This Colorado resident voted for Biden in the last presidential election. He's eager to to watch the debate. I feel like I know what's going to happen. I know that Kamala Harris is an extremely competent debater. I still remember her and Mike Pence's debate from four years ago and I'm really excited to see her go toe-to-toe with Trump. I'm happy to have somebody on stage who will be able to directly counter, really be an opposing force, to him on stage. The biggest trap is that Donald Trump says so many things so quickly. It's easy to get wrapped up in what he's saying. I hope that Harris doesn't sink to his level. I'd love to see her maintain her optimistic, upbeat message even in the face of Trump.  An independent voter from the swing state of Pennsylvania, she backed Biden last time but plans to vote third-party or write in a candidate come November.   I honestly haven't been planning on watching the debate, at least not live. I'm not excited about either candidate at all.  From what I've seen from our debates in the last few elections, they're just platforms for who can yell the loudest and who's got the best one liner that will catch a headline. I haven't heard anything of substance.  If someone got up on stage and they were realistic about what they could achieve or could not achieve, then maybe that would change my mind. But I don't think either of them are going to say anything like that. This Republican voter backed Trump in 2016 and 2020. She’s planning to vote for him again, but she wants to hear more about policy from both. I’m looking at it like it’s a job interview, it’s who I’m choosing for president. Everyday, I talk to people at the poverty level and it seems like it’s getting worse. I personally think the economy was better under Trump. I want to hear what Kamala Harris is going to do. What I’ve been hearing is mostly her vibes and you can’t run the United States of America on vibes only. I am hoping for a great debate where both parties actually lay their policies out on the table. This Republican voted for Trump in 2020 - his first election - and believes the economy was much better under the former president’s administration. I think it will be informative and entertaining at the very least. I‘d like to know how our economy is going to get back on track. I’d also like to know about the candidates’ plans for reducing illegal immigration. I believe Trump’s strengths are an actual laid out policy. I think Kamala Harris has kind of hidden her views or switched her views. He does a better job laying out his plans. But I think his biggest weakness is his demeanour. I do plan on voting for Trump again and I hope he wins the debate, but I think there’s not a lot either of them can do or say to change people’s minds. This independent voted for Trump in 2020 but is currently undecided this time.  I am much happier that we'll be having Kamala up there and I'm really happy that they're going to be doing it muted [so they can't interrupt each other]. [The candidates are] getting so personal about each other. Even in the last debate, I'm like: 'Did you guys even answer the question? Or are you guys just defending yourself about what he said about you?' They're just personally attacking each other instead of answering any of the things that we want to hear. This Democrat was glad to see Mr Biden step down as the nominee and believes his party now has a better shot at beating Trump.   I do plan on watching. I think Biden's debate performance was pretty disappointing and so I'm way more excited to see what Harris is able to do and how she carries herself and presents herself. A big issue for me is climate change and environmental policy and so I'd be curious to hear what she says on that.  However, the sad thing, at least for me, is that I would vote for anyone [over Trump]. I almost don't care what your policy positions are. I just know what your policy positions aren't and so therefore, I'm stuck with you come hell or high water. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e8jlyqe7vo,Trump pleads not guilty as interference case deadlines loom over election,Trump's federal election interference case in Washington is moving forward again after a lengthy delay at the US Supreme Court,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to revised federal charges against him over his alleged attempts to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, also set a timeline Thursday for both sides to file briefings on the immunity issue. One deadline will coincide with the closing weeks of the US presidential election, meaning new evidence could be aired just as voters head to the polls. Jack Smith, the special counsel on the case, had updated the wording of the charges against Trump last week, after the US Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents had broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. Trump's lawyers officially entered the not guilty plea on his behalf in Washington at the arraignment.  The former president waived his right to be present at the hearing. He has denied accusations that he pressed officials to reverse the 2020 election results, and that he knowingly spread lies about election fraud and exploited a riot at the US Capitol to delay the certification of Joe Biden’s victory.  The revised indictment leaves in place the four charges against Trump: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. Trump also pleaded not guilty to the original charges.  The revised charges were tailored to cover Trump's status at the time as a political candidate, not just a sitting president. ""The defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election,"" reads the new indictment. Late Thursday afternoon, Judge Chutkan issued deadlines for prosecutors and Trump's attorneys to file briefs with their respective arguments on presidential immunity. She did not set a new trial date. Mr Smith must file an opening brief on presidential immunity by 26 September, and Trump's team has until 17 October to respond to it, she said. The parties face several deadlines through September and October to file necessary motions. The dates will coincide with the final sprint of the US presidential election, where Trump is locked in a tight race with the Democratic nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris. The election is 5 November. “This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule,"" Judge Chutkan said, according to POLITICO. ""There needs to be some forward movement in this case, regardless of when the election is held.'' Judge Chutkan's deadlines mean Mr Smith could air some of the evidence his team has gathered against Trump around the same time that voters head to the polls. Trump's attorney, John Lauro expressed concern that the process would play out “at this very sensitive time in our nation’s history,"" POLITICO reported. There is a strong likelihood that Trump would move to end this case should he retake the White House; as president, he would have broad authority over the US Justice Department. Trump has categorised the case in the past as a ""witch hunt"" designed to ""distract the American people"" from the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Several key allegations against Trump remain in the new indictment, including that he attempted to persuade then-Vice-President Mike Pence to obstruct Mr Biden's election certification - a point that Judge Chutkan and Trump's legal team sparred over during Thursday's hearing. Mr Lauro argued the new indictment has a ""major problem"" because the Supreme Court had decided that communication between Trump and Mr Pence constitutes an official act. Judge Chutkan responded: ""No, I would disagree with you, Mr Lauro, they have not decided that. They've sent it back to me to figure that one out."" The federal case over the 2020 election is one of several legal troubles facing Trump. In another case led by Mr Smith, Trump is accused of taking classified documents back to his Florida home after leaving office. That case has been dismissed by a Florida judge, but Mr Smith has appealed that decision. Separately in Georgia, Trump and 18 other defendants are also accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty, but the case is stalled while Trump's lawyers fight to remove prosecutor Fani Willis from the case. Meanwhile, Trump awaits sentencing in New York for his conviction of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to a porn star. It is not yet clear whether the judge in that case, Justice Juan Merchan, will grant Trump's request to delay the sentencing until after the US presidential election."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nerwe8rro,Trump's message of American decline resonates with pivotal voters,"Kamala Harris rattled her rival at the debate, but he's still winning in Michigan on issues that may decide election.",12 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris may have rattled Donald Trump on the debate stage, but the former president’s promise to save a nation in decline resonates with undecided voters in this part of a key battleground state. It took Paul Simon four days to hitchhike from Saginaw, or so he sang in America, his iconic soundscape ballad of the 1960s with its lost souls on the highways of a country in flux. Back then, this city’s long, slow decline had already begun, as Michigan’s once mighty car factories pulled down the shutters, buffeted by the winds of foreign competition. Today, the angst and loneliness of Simon and Art Garfunkel’s song are magnified many times over. I found 57-year-old Rachel Oviedo sitting on her porch, staring out at abandoned furniture in the street and beyond, the shell of a plant that once made car parts for Chevrolets and Buicks, but finally closed its doors in 2014. “We sit here all day long,” she told me. “We see homeless people come in and out of there, they need to tear it down and make something out of it.” “A grocery store,” she suggested. “Because we ain’t got no grocery stores round here.” I first met her the day before Tuesday night’s debate in Philadelphia, when she told me she was still unsure of how she was going to vote. Donald Trump, she said, felt like a known quantity and like “a man of his word”, while Kamala Harris looked promising but still somewhat unknown. “I like her,” she said, “but we don’t know what she’s going to do.” Most US states lean either so strongly Democratic or so strongly Republican that the result is a foregone conclusion. And if Michigan is one of the few swing states, then Saginaw is one of the few places in it where the vote could genuinely go either way. When they come to cast their ballots, it will be undecided voters like Rachel, in places like this, who’ll quite literally have the future of America in their hands. Chuck Brenner, a retired Saginaw cop, is another one. The 49-year-old, who still works part time in probation and runs his own real estate company, says he’s seen up close the problems here. “Almost everybody’s dad worked in the car industry,” he told me. “Back then, everybody had money and jobs were readily available. You’ve seen the change, people are struggling because people are growing up poor and then drugs and all that.” Trump’s message of American decline resonates with Chuck. “Absolutely,” he told me. “Because you can see it.” But although he voted for Mr Trump in 2016, he went for Joe Biden in 2020. “There was a lot of drama with Trump,“ he added. “And the legal issues. I kind of got sick of that.” This time round, he’d only make up his mind, he insisted, once he’d watched the debate and heard what both candidates had to say. Saginaw, like the wider state of Michigan, was once solid Democrat country - its political inclinations revealed in the list of candidates it has backed down the decades: Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. That 2016 vote, when Saginaw went – like Mr Brenner – for Trump, marked a shift. You don’t have to spend long here to realise just how remarkable a shift that was. Jeremy Zehnder runs a truck-polishing company, doing the kind of work Democrats used to be able to depend on for support. Surrounded by the giant, gleaming trucks and trailers, the lifeblood of the American economy’s distribution networks, he tells me it’s not debate performances, but the cost of living that will determine how he votes. And a majority of voters tell pollsters they trust Trump more on the economy. “With the truckers, every one of those that we know of are leaning towards the right,” he told me. “What, every one?” I ask. “I don’t know of one that isn’t,” he replied. “I mean we do hundreds of trucks every year. And they all want to talk about it, everybody talks about it.” At a United Auto Workers Union event where members watched the debate, I met one of the union organisers, Joe Losier. The UAW has pledged its support to Kamala Harris and much of the crowd in the room whooped and clapped with every put-down she threw Trump’s way. But dig a bit deeper and the fault lines of America’s political upheaval can be found here, too. “My dad and all my uncles on both sides of my family, who are all UAW people, have become Republicans,” Mr Losier told me, unable to hide the incredulity in his own voice. “These are second generation immigrants who came over here, started working in the auto industry back in World War One and it blows my mind that a lot of my family are tradesmen who are supporting Donald Trump.” He’s even unsure which way his two adult sons are going to vote. Dinner times are “horrible”, he said. With workers fearing further shift cuts and job losses, the union finds itself increasingly out of step with its members. There’s deep support here for Donald Trump’s promise of tough tariffs on imports, and disagreement with Kamala Harris’s argument in the debate that the policy would simply drive up prices. After the debate, I called Chuck Brenner to see what he’d made of it. He had some good news for Democrats. “I do believe Kamala was the shining star,” he told me. “And the bottom line is she’s won my vote. I was impressed by what she had to say, her delivery.” “With Trump,” he went on, “it was kind of what I expected. There were no surprises there. It’s kind of like the same. The same.” Rachel Oviedo was still undecided, she told me, but now leaning more towards Trump. “I think he’ll do more for us up here,” she said. “You know, he did things he shouldn’t have done”, she added. “But you gotta forgive people.” And Jeremy Zehnder, the truck polisher, admitted to being slightly surprised by Harris’s performance. “She did much better than I thought she would,” he told me. “I think she won it.” But he’s sticking with Trump. It’s about policy, he said. Taxes, the border and the cost of living. On the streets of Saginaw, Kathleen Skelcy was knocking on doors, busy canvassing for Harris. She told me she finds it a struggle to see any rationale behind the political motivations of her opponents. “That’s what’s scary, trying to understand these people and their thinking,” she said. “I just think they’re not educated, or they fell asleep in school or something.” It’s easy to see this as patronising, another sign that some Democrats chalk Trump’s appeal as merely delusional. It's clear, however, that trust and understanding can be in short supply on both sides. As we’re talking, a Trump supporter, aggressive and threatening, emerges shouting from his home, following Kathleen up the street. “Harris is a clown,” he yells, adding a few profanities for good measure. And on the doorsteps, one Democratic supporter declines the offer of a Harris sign for their front yard, scared, they say, of inviting similar abuse. In a few weeks, Saginaw will go the polls. Before then, it’s almost certain that many more journalists will pass through this key bellwether district, all of them looking for America. It’s here alright, in all its striving and struggling, and in a story today being lived out in stark political division. A debate needs middle ground.  And there’s very little of that left.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkdmdg78jgo,Pope urges Catholics to pick 'lesser evil' between Trump and Harris,"Pontiff calls candidates ""against life"", criticising Trump on immigration and Harris on abortion.",14 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Pope Francis has called both major US presidential candidates ""against life"" and advised Catholic voters to choose the ""lesser evil"" when casting their ballots in the November election. The pontiff said not welcoming migrants - seemingly referring to Trump - is a ""grave"" sin, and compared Kamala Harris's stance on abortion to an ""assassination"".  “Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies,″ the Pope said in rare political comments at a Friday news conference as he wrapped up a 12-day tour through southeast Asia. The Pope did not refer to Harris or Trump by name in his comments.  American Catholics make up 52 million of the 1.4 billion Catholics globally.  Pope Francis was asked to counsel Catholic voters during the in-flight news conference and noted in his remarks that he was not an American and would not be voting in the election.  But he encouraged Americans to vote.  ""Not voting is ugly. It is not good. You must vote,"" he said. ""You must choose the lesser evil. Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone, in conscience, (has to) think and do this."" The Pope has frequently criticised abortion, which is forbidden by Catholic teaching, in sharp terms. ""Forcing a child from the mother's womb is an assassination because there is life there,"" Francis said.  And this is not his first time making critical comments about Trump.  During the 2016 election, he described Trump as ""not Christian"" because of the presidential contender's anti-immigrant language.  ""Expelling migrants, not letting them develop, not letting them have a life is an ugly thing, it's mean,"" he said on Friday. Trump has repeatedly promised to crack down on illegal immigration and as recently as Friday afternoon said he would deport millions of immigrants if re-elected.  Harris has promised to expand nationwide protections for access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.  Pope Francis's remarks come days after Trump and Harris debated one another for the first time. The pair was expected to take the debate stage one more time before election day, but Trump has said he would not debate Harris again. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeyjpew51ko,What time is the Harris v Trump presidential debate? Everything to know,"The two candidates will go head-to-head in Philadelphia. Here are the rules, moderators and what's at stake.",10 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"With less than two months to go until Americans cast their ballots for president on election day, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will confront each other in their first debate on Tuesday. The Republican ex-president and the Democratic vice-president remain locked in a tight race, both nationally and in the swing states. The primetime duel on ABC News will be their first meeting and only the second time they have shared the same room. It is not the first debate of the campaign. Trump faced Joe Biden on stage in June, weeks before the president dropped out of the race. The debate begins at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST) on Tuesday 10 September. It takes place live on US network ABC from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The event will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks, and there will be no audience in the room. It will be streamed live on the BBC News channel. You will be able to watch on the BBC News website and app via our live page. The BBC will have a team of reporters in Philadelphia and in Washington providing analysis, fact checks and reactions as part of our live coverage. ABC World News Tonight anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will be the moderators. They will not have to deal with two candidates interrupting each other because the mics will be muted when either of them is not speaking. Those were the rules for the debate earlier this year between Trump and Mr Biden, following a disruptive 2020 debate between them. Ms Harris was hoping to get the mics switched on throughout because the present format, her campaign said, ""shields Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the vice-president"". Trump will get the last word at the debate and Ms Harris chose to appear on the right side of viewers' TV screens. No topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates or their campaigns, and no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on stage. Both candidates will only have a pen, notepad and water bottle, and cannot interact with campaign staff during commercial breaks. Neither is permitted to step away from their lecterns - as Trump did against Hillary Clinton in 2016. As shown by the fallout from Mr Biden's stumbling debate performance that led to him ending his candidacy, presidential debates are high-stakes campaign milestones that can reshape the race. It's a unique chance for candidates to make a good impression with voters as clips go viral and soundbites are replayed over and over.  This will be particularly important for Kamala Harris, who has largely stuck to scripted appearances in her campaign so far. New polling by Siena College for the New York Times, published on Sunday, suggests many voters have yet to work out who she is and what she stands for. The race between her and Trump remains extremely close, both nationally and in the swing states that will decide the outcome.  Ms Harris is preparing by working with Washington lawyer Karen Dunn, according to the New York Times, which says Dunn has helped Democratic politicians plan for debates for nearly two decades.  Dunn, who often represents tech companies in court, operates with ""tough love"", 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told the newspaper.  ""She’s unafraid to say, ‘That’s not going to work’... But she also offers encouragement,"" Clinton said. Philippe Reines, a former Clinton adviser who stood in for Trump during her mock debates, is reportedly reprising the role for Ms Harris. Trump has taken a different approach that has partly focused on speaking to voters, his team says. One adviser told the BBC he was also working to hone the ""theatrics"" of his debate performance. Notable advisers to the former president in the lead-up to this debate are Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who clashed with Ms Harris during the party's 2020 primary debates, and Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz. On 1 October, rival running mates JD Vance and Tim Walz will participate in a single vice-presidential debate on CBS News. But the presidential campaigns have not agreed on the terms for any future showdowns between Trump and Ms Harris. Trump has called for at least two more. He is pushing in particular for a showdown on more friendly turf - moderated by Fox News and with a large live audience. The Harris campaign has said it will evaluate whether or not to do a second debate in October, once their first face-off has concluded. The non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) that has overseen these events since 1988 has been sidelined in favour of the TV networks dealing directly with the campaigns. The CPD, which intended to organise three debates in September and October, has blamed the Biden campaign for failing to abide by tradition."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje3zl0dq2ko,Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu is trying to sway US election,Some Democrats accuse Israel's PM of holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal for political reasons.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"President Joe Biden has said he is unsure whether Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal in order to influence next month's US election. He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: ""Whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know - but I’m not counting on that.” Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: “No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,"" he said. ""And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that."" Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November. Earlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: “I don’t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel’s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s actions, as connected to the American election."" Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.  The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel’s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November.  Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close. A deal before the election would be a major boost for the president and the Democratic Party but appears increasingly unlikely.  While the Biden administration has mostly criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has rejected suggestions from Washington that an agreement is close.  ""Hamas is not there with a deal. There’s not a deal in the making, unfortunately,” the Israeli prime minister said earlier this month just hours after a US official said it was 90% complete. The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. It has also vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack this week. At his appearance at Friday's press briefing, which came as a shock to  reporters in the room as it was his first since becoming president four years ago, Biden responded to concern that Israel could strike Iranian oil fields in retaliation.  ""The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike,"" he said. ""If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields."" Biden caused oil prices to rise on Thursday when he said the US was discussing with Israel the possibility of strikes on Iran’s oil infrastructure."

The 44-year-old has been described as the Kremlin's top propagandist and ideologue, almost more Putinist than the Russian president himself. Ms Simonyan responded to her name appearing in the US Treasury's sanctions list this week. ""Oh, they woke up,"" she said on X. In reference to other RT employees on the list, she stated: ""Well done, team."" Her views towards the West are perhaps best summarised by comments in her last interview with the BBC, in March, as Mr Putin prepared to secure a fifth term as president in a largely uncontested election. Asked whether there was a serious challenger, she replied: ""Is there a need for a serious opponent? Why? We are not like you.  ""And we don't like you much, really."" Ms Simonyan was born in the Krasnodar region of Russia into an Armenian family. Her academic achievements helped her gain a place on a prestigious exchange programme to the US, and she arrived in New Hampshire in 1995. She later returned to Russia and became a TV journalist. Her rise to prominence came in 2004, when she reported on the Beslan school siege by Chechen militants. It ended after three days with the bloody state response that left hundreds dead, including 186 children.  For Ms Simonyan it led to rapid advancement. Soon after, she was chosen, aged 25, to create and lead the international network Russia Today, later rebranded as RT. From there, over two decades, she has become an outspoken critic of the West and a staunch supporter of Mr Putin, and has presided over a network that has grown from infancy into what the US describes as ""the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet"" central to alleged attempts to disrupt its presidential election. As the years have gone by, both her own rhetoric and that of her channel have toughened. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, as Russia's relationship with the West began to deteriorate, the network started to face accusations that it was spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda. In 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and occupied parts of the east of Ukraine, it became openly hostile both towards Ukraine and the West.  It began referring to the democratically-elected government in Ukraine as the ""Kyiv regime"" and accused Western nations of instigating the country's 2014 revolution, and of trying to undermine or even destroy Russia. But Ms Simonyan is not just at the head of Russia's external propaganda operation - she is also heavily involved in internal messaging and regularly appears on Russian political TV talk shows. Then came Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After years of threats, the UK finally banned her channel. In Russia many top journalists and editors resigned, in what appeared to be a mass exodus in opposition to the war. Ms Simonyan accused former colleagues - and anyone else opposed to the war - of ""not really being Russian"". She played a central role in one of the biggest spy stories of the Ukraine war, publishing a leaked recording of German air force officers discussing long-range weapons that could be given to Ukraine and how they could be used. Her public views are now indistinguishable from Kremlin policy. She has pushed the line that Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions should hold referendums, ""and let people stay with those they want to stay with. It's fair"". Correction 6 September 2024: A previous version of this article written in London included incorrectly translated comments attributed to Margarita Simonyan during a TV show in April. They have now been removed."

He was visiting firefighters in Pennsylvania near where one of the four hijacked planes crashed, and the White House said he donned the cap as a gesture of unity. Video recording the incident shows the president having a friendly conversation with a Trump supporter before they swap headwear. Donald Trump's campaign was quick to see the funny side. ""Thanks for the support, Joe!"" one post read with a photo of Biden in the trademark Republican hat. Another said ""Kamala did so bad in last night's debate, Joe Biden just put on a Trump hat"".  The event in Shanksville commemorated Flight 93, which was taken over by al-Qaeda hijackers in 2001. Passengers fought back and prevented the plane being crashed into a government building in Washington. All 40 aboard died.  Biden greeted firefighters and paid respects at a cross made from the broken fuselage. Footage inside the fire station posted to social media shows Biden chatting with people and interacting with a man wearing a red hat with ""Trump 2024"" emblazoned on the front.  Biden offers the man a hat with the presidential seal on it, saying he would autograph it.  After some joking about his age, Biden hands the man the autographed cap and offers to trade it for the Trump hat.  Several of those gathered call on him to put it on, to which he shouts: ""I ain't going that far!"" before putting it on, to loud cheers. The White House later explained it was a way to underline the unity theme of the day. ""As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the  same spirit, POTUS should put on his Trump cap,"" deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.   The daughter of the man who swapped hats with the president said Biden kept the Trump hat after the interaction.  ""My pap don't care who it is,"" Kelsey Simmers told the BBC. ""He likes to joke and have fun.""  She said that her father ended up getting another cap from the Trump campaign after they reached out.  The incident happened hours after Trump had joked on the debate stage about sending Vice-President Kamala Harris a Make America Great Again hat."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypr3vd7x9o,Trump's criminal sentencing delayed until after election,"Justice Merchan to sentence Republican candidate in hush-money trial on 26 November, citing ""unique"" circumstances.",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump's sentencing in his Manhattan hush money criminal trial has been postponed until after the November election. Judge Juan Merchan on Friday delayed the sentencing to 26 November, citing ""the unique time frame this matter currently finds itself in"" among his reasons. Lawyers for Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, have used several legal manoeuvres to delay the sentencing, which had been scheduled for 18 September. A New York jury in May convicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, the first time a sitting or former president has been convicted of a crime. In his decision, Judge Merchan wrote that the case demands ""a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury"".  ""Their verdict must be respected and addressed in a manner that is not diluted by the enormity of the upcoming presidential election,"" he said, setting sentencing to exactly three weeks after the 5 November election. He said the delay was necessary ""to avoid any appearance - however unwarranted - that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate”. “The Court is a fair, impartial and apolitical institution,” the judge continued. Trump could face a sentence of up to four years in prison, but Judge Merchan also has the discretion to impose a punishment of a fine, probation or a shorter jail term. Prosecutors in the case accused the former president of concealing a payment to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a former adult-film star, in the final days of his 2016 election campaign. Ms Daniels testified that she and Trump had sex, and that she accepted $130,000 (£99,000) from his former lawyer before the 2016 election in exchange to keep quiet about the encounter. Prosecutors argued that, by approving a scheme to disguise the money as legal expenses, Trump broke the law. A jury found him guilty on all counts. Trump's original sentencing date was in July. His lawyers delayed that after a US Supreme Court ruling that granted presidents some immunity from criminal prosecution for ""official acts"". Judge Merchan granted a delay so that the parties could prepare arguments on the effects of the Supreme Court ruling on his case. A decision on the implications will come on 12 November. Judge Merchan has already dismissed some arguments made by Trump's lawyers to delay as ""unsubstantiated grievances... that do not merit this Court's attention"". But he wrote that sentencing hearings are routinely delayed in other cases for reasons like personal circumstances or scheduling conflicts.  ""Given the unique facts and circumstances of this case, there is no reason why this Defendant should be treated differently than any other,"" Judge Merchan said. He added that his decision to delay ""should dispel any suggestion"" that the court would have made a decision that would be seen in support of ""any political party or any candidate for any office"". Trump has maintained that he did nothing wrong. He told Fox News after the ruling that the ""case should be dead"". On his social media platform Truth Social, the former president re-iterated his claims of innocence, dismissing the case as a ""witch hunt"" and a ""political attack"". ""This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country,"" he wrote. A spokesperson for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney whose office brought the charges, said his team was ""ready for sentencing on the new date set by the court"". If Trump is re-elected US president, he could order the Justice Department to drop the ongoing federal cases against him. However, this case in New York - as well as the election interference case in Georgia - involved state charges, and a president would not have the authority to interfere."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n00e3z87o,Canada's NDP pulls support for Trudeau's Liberals,The end of a deal between the two parties puts Mr Trudeau's minority government at risk of falling in a non-confidence vote.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Canada’s left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP) has pulled the plug on a two-and-a-half-year-old agreement with Justin Trudeau's Liberals that had helped keep his minority government in power. In a video posted to social media on Wednesday, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he had informed the prime minister of his decision, saying the Liberals were ""too weak, too selfish"" to fight for Canadians. The deal - called a ""supply and confidence"" agreement - had the NDP supporting the Liberals in confidence votes. The announcement does not automatically mean a federal election is imminent but  that Canadians may go to the polls before the election scheduled for October 2025. In a statement released on Wednesday, Mr Singh said a non-confidence vote would be ""on the table"" with every confidence measure. Losing a confidence vote in parliament can trigger a general election. ""The NDP is ready for an election,"" Mr Singh said.  Mr Trudeau and Mr Singh reached the agreement in March 2022, with the Liberals pledging to support the NDP on several of the party's key priorities in parliament.  The deal differed to a coalition, where parties share power.  Instead, the Liberals - who failed to win a majority in the past two elections - governed as a minority, but with assurances the NDP would support them in confidence votes. In exchange, Mr Singh's party secured progress on key priorities, including dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.  It was the first such formal agreement between two parties at the federal level.  Until this spring, Mr Singh and senior members of his party remained publicly committed to the deal.  But NDP's leadership reportedly began to re-evaluate the agreement last month, after Mr Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration after Canada's two largest railways began a work stoppage.  Announcing he was tearing up the deal, Mr Singh said the Liberals had ""let people down"" and didn't ""deserve another chance from Canadians"".  Mr Trudeau, speaking at an event in Newfoundland, told reporters he was confident he could make parliament work and will focus on ""delivering for Canadians"".  ""I'll let others focus on politics,"" he said, adding he hoped the next election will not happen ""until next fall"" so that his government has time to move forward on its agenda.  In recent years, Canadian voters have shown increasing frustration with issues like  rising inflation and a housing affordability crisis. That has been reflected in the polls, where the Liberals have been down for months, with national opinion surveys suggesting the party is lagging about 18 points behind the opposition Conservatives. On Wednesday, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticised Mr Singh for not committing to a non-confidence vote, dismissing the announcement as a ""stunt"".  Last week, he penned an open letter urging Mr Singh to abandon his agreement with the Liberals.  ""No one voted for you to keep Trudeau in power. You do not have a mandate to drag out his government another year,"" Mr Poilievre wrote.  Mr Trudeau has been in power since 2015, with the Liberals winning re-election - albeit with a minority - in 2019 and 2021. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1488zz8jnzo,Trump loses Electric Avenue song legal fight,The former president used the famous song in a 2020 campaign video.,15 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former US President Donald Trump has been found liable to pay damages to London singer and songwriter Eddy Grant for using his song Electric Avenue without permission. It has taken Mr Grant, 76, more than four years to sue the Republican candidate in this year’s presidential election in the US courts, over his 2020 campaign video that used a 40-second clip of the song. The video was viewed 13.7 million times before Twitter, now known as X, took it down. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Mr Trump breached Mr Grant's copyright for his 1983 hit, and is now liable for damages as well as paying for the singer's legal fees. Mr Grant's battle with the former President began in August 2020, when he was seeking re-election to the White House. The songwriter's counsel, Wallace E.J. Collins, issued a cease and desist letter to Donald Trump's campaign team. On Friday, Judge John G. Koeltl rejected arguments from Mr Trump’s lawyers that the Twitter video was shielded under copyright’s fair use doctrine, which allows for the use of protected works in certain situations. Brian D. Caplan, Mr Grant’s attorney, told Business Insider: “As a staunch believer of artist’s rights and the ability to control their creative output, Mr. Grant believes that the decision will help others in their fight against the unauthorized use of sound recordings and musical compositions. “Politicians are not above the law and the court reaffirmed that.” Earlier this month a US judge has ordered the Trump campaign to stop using the song Hold On, I’m Coming at his rallies, in response to a lawsuit from the family of the song's co-writer, Isaac Hayes. Dozens of other artists have objected to the use of their songs at Trump rallies in recent months including Abba, Foo Fighters, Celine Dion and Johnny Marr. Electric Avenue takes its name from the south London road in Brixton, the first market street in the capital to be lit by electricity. It still forms part of Brixton Market today. It inspired the title of Mr Grant’s song, written as a response to the 1981 Brixton riots, which reached number two in the charts in both the UK and the US. Mr Trump's team has been approached for comment about the Electric Avenue court case. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77l28myezko,Trump repeats baseless claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets,"Donald Trump claimed immigrants in a small Ohio city were eating pets, but there’s no proof of this.",15 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A baseless claim that illegal immigrants from Haiti have been eating domestic pets in a small Ohio city has been repeated by Donald Trump.  During ABC's presidential debate, Trump said: ""In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating – they are eating the pets of the people that live there."" But city officials have told BBC Verify there have been “no credible reports"" that this has actually happened. The baseless claim had spread on social media, with Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance promoting it on X. The post has had more than 11 million views. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called Vance's comments ""dangerous"" and a ""conspiracy theory... based on an element of racism"".  The claim appears to have come from a number of different sources which have been turned into a cohesive - though baseless  - story by pro-Trump social media accounts. At a 27 August meeting of Springfield’s city commission, a local resident who describes himself as a social media influencer launched into a speech against Haitian immigrants. He gave a long list of grievances, including that they were slaughtering park ducks for food, and accused city officials of being paid to bring in immigrants, but provided no evidence for these claims. A claim about a cat being killed by Haitian immigrants was made on a Facebook post focusing on crime in Springfield, and attributed by the poster to the friend of a neighbour’s daughter. During the presidential debate on Tuesday, Trump also claimed to have seen “people on television [saying] ‘My dog was taken and used for food’”.  BBC Verify has looked at archive video of every major US broadcaster, including Fox, CNN and CBS. We also used keywords to search for relevant video on social media, and have not identified any televised interview of this nature. Separately, a news report - as well as police bodycam footage - from late August about a woman arrested for killing and eating a cat has also been circulating online. Many right-wing commentators have referred to the woman as Haitian and pointed to the report as evidence for the baseless claim that Haitian immigrants have been engaged in similar activity. However, the incident took place in Canton, Ohio, about 170 miles (273km)  away from Springfield. Canton Police told the BBC that the suspect was born in 1997 and that she was a US citizen. The department also told us ""we have not dealt with any complaints of Haitian immigrants at all."" BBC Verify spoke to the Springfield City Commission about the claims. Officials told us: “There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” The claims have also been reflected in a post on Reddit with a photo of a man carrying what appears to be a dead goose in Columbus, Ohio. On 10 September, the conservative news outlet, The Federalist, published a story with an audio recording allegedly from a non-emergency call to police in Springfield. The caller claimed to have seen four Haitians carrying four geese. The article also features what is meant to be a police report from the Clark County Sheriff’s Office about the call which it says was made on 26 August. BBC Verify contacted the sheriff’s office and asked them whether the audio recording and police report were true. It directed us to a Springfield City government spokesperson who said ""these claims were not substantiated"". Elon Musk has posted memes referring to the baseless claims which have been viewed millions of times. Charlie Kirk, the CEO of conservative activist group Turning Point, said: “Residents of Springfield, OH are reporting that Haitians are eating their family pets”. And official Republican party social media channels, such as the Republican House Judiciary Committee X account, have also referred to the claims. The account posted an AI-generated image of former president Trump hugging a duck and a cat with the caption “Protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio!”. That post was seen nearly 70 million times. The BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. On Tuesday, Vance appeared to row back on his previous comment and said on X: ""It's possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false."" But he added: ""keep the cat memes flowing"". On Sunday, when challenged about the claim on CNN, he replied: ""The evidence is the first-hand account of my constituents who are telling me this happened."" ""If i have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what i'm going to do"", he added.   Springfield, a rust belt city in south-west Ohio, is home to about 60,000 people and has seen thousands of immigrants arrive in recent years. Many are from Haiti, and city officials say up to 20,000 have made Springfield home in recent years, reversing a long decline that saw the city’s population drop by more than 20,000 over the last 60 years. The new arrivals have revitalised local industrial companies but have also put a strain on public services. Vance, a senator representing Ohio who grew up about an hour away from Springfield, has repeatedly talked about the city on the campaign trail.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl3qd1g90o,Don't mention Trump - how Republicans try to sway women voters,Party leaders in swing states say they focus on issues to win back women put off by Trump's personality.,8 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Surrounded by food trucks, Ferris wheels and funnel cake stands on a hot August afternoon, Stephanie Soucek has one goal in mind. The 42-year-old chair of the Republican Party in Door County, a bellwether district in the battleground state of Wisconsin, is at the county fair to urge undecided voters to cast a ballot for Donald Trump. Upon meeting Tammy Conway, a Democrat who is considering voting Republican for the first time in decades, Ms Soucek begins talking about her own family’s two expensive car payments, an economic message that seems to resonate. Ms Conway is concerned about “sky-high” housing interest rates and says Trump might make the economy “a lot less complicated”. But as Ms Soucek lays out her case for the Republican presidential candidate, she avoids mentioning the latest spate of controversial remarks Trump has made, including personal attacks on Democratic challenger Kamala Harris. “I try to tell people to focus on the policies and ignore the candidates,” she says, knowing that Trump’s brash personality has deterred women previously. Republican officials in a handful of swing states – where the election is likely to be decided – are adopting Ms Soucek’s strategy of promoting policy over personality with white suburban female voters. It's a pivotal voting bloc Trump narrowly won in his first presidential race but has struggled to appeal to since. Local Republicans say they wish Trump would adopt a similar approach against Vice-President Harris, whose campaign has been powered by female voters since she replaced Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July. The concern brings into focus the widening gender gap that has come to define the election. Trump is courting young – especially black and Hispanic – men while Democrats are working to attract female voters motivated by the overturning of Roe v Wade, a landmark Supreme Court ruling that had enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released in September suggested the vice-president led the former president 54% to 41% among women - a seven-point jump since the Democratic National Convention late last month. It has some Republicans worried about whether Trump can reverse the trend, Ms Soucek says. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Ms Harris had ""implemented dangerously liberal policies that have left women worse off financially and far less safe than we were four years ago under President Trump”. But some who spoke to the BBC said his campaign had remained fixated on men - not women. Republican pollster Christine Matthews said Trump’s team is “doubling down on a strategy of motivating the Maga base and hoping to motivate men - particularly non-college-educated men including those who are Hispanic in addition to white - in a way that will overpower the gender gap”. The Trump campaign has leaned into “bro culture”, emphasising masculinity and a contrast of “weak versus tough”, said Chuck Coughlin, a political strategist who works with Republicans in the battleground state of Arizona. “That appeals to a lot of men,” he said. “It doesn’t appeal to unaffiliated voters.” Trump’s choice of JD Vance as his running mate reinforced how the campaign is prioritising outreach to men. They may not have expected his addition to the ticket to have been so damaging with women voters, however. The Ohio senator has faced a backlash over previous comments about women, in particular a 2021 clip in which he calls several Democrats, including Ms Harris, “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives”. These types of comments do not help attract swing women voters, according to Betsy Fischer Martin, executive director of the nonpartisan Women & Politics Institute. “There are plenty of childless cat ladies voting in the suburbs,” she said. But the former president’s campaign rhetoric does not bother some ardent female supporters like Dixie, a 59-year-old Republican from Door County. “He’s not going to tell you what you want to hear. He’s going to tell you the truth,” said Dixie, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons. Former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who served as his 2016 campaign manager, told the BBC that voters could not have his policies without his “strong and resolute and tough” personality. “People, and particularly women, tend to kvetch and converse and complain about what offends them, and then they vote according to what affects them,” she said. Local Republicans in battleground states are hoping to stop the erosion of female support by steering the conversation back to issues that affect families on a daily basis, like crime and the economy, where polls suggest the party is more popular. The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic make it difficult to compare how the US economy performed under the Trump and Biden administrations. While both enjoyed notable economic growth, inflation has been a persistent problem in the last three years as wages have struggled to keep up with rising prices. And a recent KFF poll indicated inflation was the top issue in this race for 40% of suburban women voters. For Lyla Juntunen, 88, a former stay-at-home mom from the suburbs of Green Bay, Wisconsin, the price increases under Mr Biden have been hard to ignore. “Look at these groceries that you get and how much you pay,” she told the BBC, gesturing toward a full shopping cart in a grocery store car park. Strategists say Trump would do well to focus more on these specific economic policy points to win over voters like Ms Juntenen. ""If he dials down the attacks and his brand of fiery kind of politics, then he can pick up...female voters in particular,"" said Ariel Hill-Davis, co-founder of Republican Women for Progress, which advocates for female representation in the party. ""If your top three issues are the economy, inflation, public safety, I think he could easily sway those voters."" Republicans in swing states have struggled with another issue that has animated women across the country: reproductive rights. Democrats have seized on abortion rights as a way to galvanise voters after the fall of Roe v Wade in 2022, while Ms Harris has become the White House’s leading voice on the issue. Voters in several states - including Republican strongholds - have passed referendums protecting the right to abortion. The issue is on the ballot in at least eight states in November, including in the battleground territories of Nevada and Arizona. Republicans have struggled to reach a unified message on reproductive rights. Trump has repeatedly said policy should be left up to the states, declining to endorse a national abortion ban that many Republican lawmakers support. He was roundly criticised by anti-abortion conservatives in recent weeks after giving contradictory remarks on whether he would support a referendum in Florida to protect abortion rights - he later clarified he would vote against it. The same week, he told a Michigan crowd that if he were re-elected, his administration would cover the costs of IVF, a fertility treatment that Democrats have claimed Republicans are trying to take away through restrictive state abortion laws. Tom Eddy, the chair of the Erie County Republican Party, a swing district in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, said he’d found the best approach is to avoid the issue altogether. “I tell my candidates, ‘Stay the hell away from it,’” he said. “I can tell no matter what policy you promote with regard to abortion, you’re going to be wrong, because half the people are going to think the other way.” Though the KFF poll indicated abortion to be lower on the list of priorities for female suburban voters - behind immigration, border security and the economy - it remains a motivating issue for a growing share. A survey from the New York Times and Siena College last month suggested it had become the most important issue for female voters under the age of 45. With polls suggesting the majority of suburban women support access to abortions, Ms Soucek said the Republican Party needs to find a unified message. “It’s just a matter of making sure that we’re sending the right message to women that we care about women, while also caring about unborn babies,” she said. Mr Trump’s former senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said that while Democrats are focused on “the waist down”, the Republican Party is concentrating on the “waist up”. “We women, from the waist up, are where our brains, ears, eyes, hearts and mouths are, so we can figure out all the issues: the kitchen table economics, entrepreneurship, taxes, regulation, energy independence,” she said. But that language isn’t landing with all women voters in Wisconsin. Holly Rupnow, a 56-year-old former Republican from Green Bay, said one of the reasons she planned to vote for Ms Harris was because of reproductive rights. “I like the things that she’s going to try to do for us - get us back women’s rights,” she said. Experts say the political landscape has changed dramatically since Donald Trump first ran for president. Some female voters in 2016 brushed aside their worries about Trump, believing he would act differently once he was in the White House, according to Ms Fischer Martin. But the 2016 “Let Trump be Trump” rallying cry would not work now, she said. During the 2018 midterm elections, suburban and college-educated women largely rejected Trump and Republicans and helped power the so-called blue wave that elected more than 100 women to the US House. In 2022, reproductive rights played a central role in helping Democrats perform better than expected, raising fears among Republicans it could do so again. Trump could make strides with female suburban voters by directly addressing their concerns about his personality, according to political experts. “If he were to say something like: ‘You may not like me personally, you may not like my rhetoric, but if you want to worry less about grocery bills .. I'm your guy,’” Ms Fischer Martin said. “I don't know if he's quite capable of getting there.” Kellyanne Conway knows Trump better than most. She believes his core message - are voters better off now then when he was in office? - is the same for all Americans, regardless of gender. “As I told him recently,” she added, “He beat a woman before. He can beat a woman again.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz07zlr58vvo,Former Vice-President Dick Cheney to vote for Kamala Harris,"The lifelong Republican said Trump had ""tried to steal the last election using lies and violence"".",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former US Vice-President and lifelong Republican Dick Cheney has confirmed he will vote for the Democrats' Kamala Harris in November's presidential election.  Mr Cheney, seen as an influential figure during the presidency of George W Bush, issued a statement saying there had ""never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump"", the current Republican candidate.  His daughter, former Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney, had told an audience in Texas earlier that her father planned to back the Democratic nominee.  “He [Trump] tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,"" said Mr Cheney. ""He can never be trusted with power again.""  “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our constitution,"" he added. ""That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice-President Kamala Harris.” Mr Cheney's remarks were welcomed by the Harris camp.  “The vice-president is proud to have the support of Vice-President Cheney, and deeply respects his courage to put country over party,” said campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon. Mr Cheney joins a growing list of Republicans who have expressed concern about the candidacy of Donald Trump.  His daughter, Liz Cheney, has already given her backing to Vice-President Harris.  She served on the House select committee investigating the 6 January Capitol riots, and was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach former President Trump after the incident.  Ms Cheney lost her seat in Congress in 2022 to a Trump-backed candidate.  Taking to social media following Mr Cheney's statement, Trump called the former vice-president an ""irrelevant RINO"" - an acronym which stands for ""Republican in name only"".  He also described Mr Cheney as the ""King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars"" - alluding to his role in the Iraq War. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3vpp1z91o,Why Canadian politics just got more unpredictable,"Justin Trudeau's Liberals lost the backing of a key parliamentary ally, meaning an early election is more likely.",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Canada’s politics got a dose of uncertainty this week after the country’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) backed away from a deal that helped keep Justin Trudeau’s Liberals in power. The deal - called a ""supply and confidence"" agreement - had the NDP backing Mr Trudeau's minority government in confidence votes in exchange for support on key priorities. The sudden collapse of the deal means an early federal election is more likely. But NDP leader Jagmeet Singh on Thursday refused to say whether his party would seek to bring down the government at the earliest opportunity.  ""We are absolutely aware ripping up this agreement makes an election more likely,"" Mr Singh, whose party is ranked fourth in the House of Commons, said at a press conference.  ""Whenever an election comes we’ll be ready to fight it."" But he added: “We’ll have to look at each vote on its merits and decide what’s in the interests of Canadians.”  The NDP-Liberal deal was originally meant to run until June 2025, with the next general election scheduled for October of that year.  The government is now in a shakier position and could be brought down if the Liberals fail to survive any non-confidence motions put forward after parliament returns in mid-September. The NDP-Liberal pact was not a formal coalition but had the NDP supporting the government in exchange for movement on policies like a dental benefits programme for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme that would cover birth control and insulin. Until this spring, Mr Singh and senior members of his party remained publicly committed to the deal, and its collapse this week was a surprise. But there is likely some strategy behind the decision, Laura Stephenson, a professor of political science at Western University in London, Ontario, told the BBC. With two by-elections coming up in Montreal and Winnipeg on 16 September, Prof Stephenson said the NDP is likely trying to distance itself in the minds of voters from the Liberals, who have been polling poorly. “If the NDP wants to be seen as an alternative to the Liberals, they also need to distinguish themselves from the Liberals,” Prof Stephenson said. But she noted the NDP is not operating from a position of strength and likely does not want an election soon.  “People are sick and tired of the Liberals and they're looking to find an alternative, but we aren't seeing the numbers translating into gains for the NDP,” she said. An August poll of Canadian voters by Abacus Data suggested that 42% would vote for the Conservatives, who are currently the official opposition. Around 25% would vote for the Liberals, and 18% for the NDP. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had called for the NDP to end the deal and help his party force an early election.  A majority of members of parliament are needed for that to happen and Prof Stephenson anticipates Canadians will not go to the polls until March or April of next year, when the Liberals table the upcoming budget bill. Because it is a key piece of legislation, a vote on the budget can double as an expression of confidence in a sitting government. Prof Stephenson cautions, however, that with politics, anything could happen."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj71ywyeo,Ukraine approves large war-time cabinet reshuffle,"Parliament approves several new ministers, but some MPs accuse President Zelensky of centralising power.",5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Ukraine's parliament has approved President Volodymyr Zelensky's biggest government reshuffle of cabinet ministers since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Andrii Sybiha, a 49-year-old former diplomat and ex-adviser to President Zelensky, was appointed as foreign minister in the revamp, which saw nine new ministers take office.  The shake-up had been expected for months, with much of the president's cabinet left holding office in an acting capacity after a spate of resignations and dismissals.  But critics have accused the president of seeking to centralise power around his office, with several of the new ministers having once served as his advisers. Supporters say that concentrating political power is necessary during war. In the opening months of the war, Mr Zelensky largely kept senior political and military figures in place.  But in May last year, he fired defence minister Oleksii Reznikov after a series of corruption scandals, then sacked Kyiv's top military commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi earlier this year. In his nightly address from Kyiv, President Zelensky justified the changes, telling Ukrainians that he wanted his government to be ""more active"" in securing aid from the country's Western allies.  Mr Sybiha will replace Dmytro Kuleba at the foreign ministry, but his appointment is not expected to alter policy significantly. President Zelensky and his office have broadly overseen international relations from the presidential palace.  The ex-ambassador is seen by some as being closer to Andriy Yermak, the increasingly powerful presidential chief of staff. Mr Yermak was said to have clashed with Mr Kuleba.  Another key adviser to the president, Oleksiy Kuleba, has been appointed as deputy prime minister in charge of reconstruction, regions and infrastructure. He previously served as deputy head of the presidential office.  Other changes include the promotion of 38-year-old Olha Stefanyshyna. She has been reappointed as deputy prime minister in charge of European integration, while also being handed the justice portfolio.  Analysts say the move represents Ukraine's desire to move forward with its bid for EU membership. She told MPs on Wednesday that ""hundreds and thousands"" of legal changes are needed before Kyiv can become a member of the bloc.  Meanwhile, Herman Smetanin, 32, has been appointed strategic industries minister in charge of domestic arms production, a key position as Kyiv's forces face intense Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while continuing their incursion into Russia's Kursk border province.  Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, MP Inna Sovsun echoed the president in saying the reshuffle was ""the best way to bring in new people, new ideas into the government"".  But Dmytro Razumkov, a former ally of Mr Zelensky's turned opposition MP, said the new changes would have little impact on decision-making, claiming in a Telegram post on Thursday that the ""Cabinet of Ministers has not influenced anything for a long time"".  Another opposition MP, Iryna Gerashchenko, accused Mr Zelensky of ""breaking parliamentary tradition"" by not being present at votes to approve his new ministers.  She said that the nomination of key posts, such as that of foreign minister, were a ""presidential prerogative"", adding that ""always the presidents represented their candidates"".  Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker with Mr Zelesnky's Servant of the People Party, rejected the concerns, noting that the president has always been quick to dismiss ministers who were not meeting his expectation, citing the early dismissal of his first Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk after less than a year in office.  ""He came from the sphere of business and he is himself a result-orientated person,"" Mr Merezhko told the BBC.  ""When Zelensky sees someone can't deliver, he will make a change,"" he added, noting some of ministers dismissed this week were ""professionally exhausted"".  Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal welcomed the new appointments, acknowledging that they faced ""difficult tasks,"" but insisted that ""their experience and skills will help in the implementation of our state's strategic goals"".  Under martial law, Mr Zelensky boasts considerable executive powers. With elections suspended while the war continues, and the Servant of the People Party maintaining a parliamentary majority, there is a limited check on his government, some experts say.  But Mr Merezhko dismissed concerns of an over-centralisation of power around Mr Zeleasnky's office.  ""In a state of war, some kind of concentration of power is a necessity,"" he told the BBC. ""After all he is the commander-in-chief and we are waging a war, the whole state is like an army right now.""  ""The challenge for us, and we are coping with this challenge so far, is to preserve democracy and pluralism."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6ye3e8x9po,Fast fashion drove Bangladesh - now its troubled economy needs more,The once booming garment industry faces an uncertain future amid political unrest and slowing demand.,6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Bangladesh is the beating heart of the global fast fashion business. The clothes its factories export stock the shelves at H&M, Gap and Zara. Over three decades, this has transformed the country from one of the world’s poorest to a lower-middle income nation. But its garment industry, worth $55bn (£42bn) a year, is now facing an unsettled future after weeks of protests toppled the government of Sheikh Hasina in August. Hundreds of people were killed in the unrest. At least four factories were set alight, while manufacturers struggled to operate under a nationwide internet blackout. Already, some big brands have looked elsewhere for next season’s clothes, three firms that help supply to companies such as Disney, US supermarket chain Walmart and other global apparel companies told the BBC.  The disruption is continuing. From Thursday, some 60 factories outside Dhaka are expected to be closed because of worker unrest. Staff have been protesting with various demands, including for better wages. Recent events “will impact the confidence level of brands”, says Mohiuddin Rubel, a director at the country’s garments manufacturers and exporters association. “And probably they might think - should we put all our eggs in one basket?” he says, noting rival garment-producing countries like Vietnam. Indeed, Kyaw Sein Thai, who has sourcing offices in both Bangladesh and the US, suggests the recent political unrest could result in a ""10-20% drop in exports this year”. That’s no small amount when fast fashion exports account for 80% of Bangladesh’s export earnings. Even before the events of the past few months, Bangladesh’s garment industry – and its economy – were not in good health. Child labour scandals, deadly accidents and the Covid-19 shutdown had all taken their toll. Soaring prices had made manufacturing more expensive - but slowing demand meant you couldn’t sell for as much. This was especially bad for Bangladesh, which relies heavily on exports. As profits from exports shrank, so did foreign currency reserves. There were other problems too:  excessive spending on showpiece infrastructure projects had drained the government’s coffers. And rampant cronyism weakened its banks, as powerful businessmen with links to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League party failed to repay loans. “It wasn’t benign neglect but a designed robbery of the financial system,” the country’s new central bank governor, Dr Ahsan Mansur, told the BBC in a recent exclusive interview. Fixing this, Dr Mansur said, was his top priority, but he warned it would take years and the country would need more financial support, including another IMF bailout. “We are in a difficult spot and we want to remain fully compliant in terms of servicing our foreign obligations, every penny of it. But we need some additional cushion for now,” said Dr Mansur. Mahaburbur Rahman, whose family founded clothing manufacturing firm Sonia Group two decades ago, points out that the country’s falling reserves of foreign currencies alone are enough to dent confidence. “They are concerned about how we will pay for imports of yarn from India and China if we don’t have enough dollars. Many of them are not even able to come to Bangladesh anymore to place new orders because they aren’t getting travel insurance,” Mr Rahman says. But Bangladesh has a bigger problem at hand – the protests that ousted Ms Hasina were driven by students who were frustrated over the lack of well-paying jobs and opportunities. While the clothing factories may have created millions of jobs, they don’t pay well. Some factory workers who spoke to the BBC said they struggled to survive on pay that was barely half the national minimum wage, which meant they were forced to take out loans to feed their children. Many of them joined the student-led protests in recent months to demand better pay and conditions. “We will settle for nothing less than a doubling,” union leader Maria said. “Wages have to reflect the increase in cost of living.” The student protesters, though, are calling for a more radical shake-up of the jobs market. Abu Tahir, Mohammad Zaman, Mohammad Zaidul and Sardar Armaan were all part of the demonstrations. All unemployed for between two and five years, they tell the BBC that they are keen to work for the private sector but don’t feel as if they are qualified for the jobs that are available. “[My parents] hardly understand how competitive the job market is. To be unemployed is a major source of pressure in my family. I feel belittled,” Mr Zaman says. “We just get a degree, we are not getting the right skills,” says Mr Zaidul. “The new adviser is an entrepreneur himself though, so we all feel more hopeful he’ll do something about this,” he adds, referring to the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus.  Mr Yunus won a Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work in micro loans. Dr Fahmida Khatun of the Centre for Policy Dialogue think tank points out that diversifying the economy will be critical to meet the aspirations of educated youth - arguing that that would be no bad thing for the economy. “No country can survive for a long time based on only one sector,” she says. “It will take you so far, but no further. There have been [diversification] attempts, but so far it’s only been in the books.” A disused technology park outside the capital Dhaka offers evidence of this. Inaugurated in 2015, it was meant to be part of a nationwide initiative to create higher paid jobs and cut Bangladesh’s reliance on garment production. It now sits abandoned – a reminder of the previous administration’s economic failures. “This is the perfect example of the gap between what industry needs and what the government has provided,” says Russel T Ahmed, a software entrepreneur. “Nobody asked us if we needed these parks. Bangladesh has been investing in physical infrastructure, but how much have we invested in human infrastructure? That is the raw material this industry needs.” What the new government needs to do, says Dr Khatun, is remove bottlenecks like corruption and red tape to encourage foreign and private investment. Mr Yunus has vowed to bring comprehensive reforms to the country’s economy and fix institutions that have, as Dr Khatun says, been “systematically destroyed” over the past few years. He has a formidable task ahead – steadying the economy, delivering free and fair elections, and preventing government policymaking from being controlled by vested interests. All of this has to be done as the country faces a raft of other problems: slowing global demand for the goods it makes, deteriorating relations with its giant neighbour and trading partner India, which is harbouring  Ms Hasina, and climate change causing more intense cyclones in the flood-prone nation. These challenges are as vast as the hopes many people have heaped on Mr Yunus’ shoulders."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l1qd1nwnjo,"Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues, from tax to Israel","From abortion to trade, here are his policy pledges as he runs for the White House for a third time.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president for the third consecutive election.  When he was defeated by Joe Biden after his first term in office, the country was in the midst of Covid, lockdowns and social unrest.  It followed a campaign in which restoring both economic health and law and order were his central messages. Here are his policy pledges this time. This is the biggest issue for voters and it’s the pinch of high food and housing costs that seems to be shaping their sentiment rather than the robust growth and low unemployment. Inflation has fallen steeply from a 40-year high in 2022, but the former New York businessman has retained a persistent polling advantage on the economy over his Democratic opponents. One of the 20 core promises on his campaign website is to “end inflation and make America affordable again”. A president’s power to lower prices directly is very limited. Trump has pledged to expand US energy production, opening areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs, though analysts are sceptical. He says he can reduce housing costs by preventing some undocumented immigrants from getting mortgages and deporting others, and by launching a home building programme on federal land. Trump has a raft of tax cuts planned. Firstly, he wants to extend the cuts he enacted in 2017, which are due to expire next year. That was the biggest tax overhaul in decades, aimed at simplifying the tax code and promoting growth and investment. The largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse. The Republican also wants to shave a further percentage point off corporation tax - and has floated an even bigger cut to 15%. He has proposed making tipped income tax free, a proposal that his opponent Kamala Harris subsequently backed, too. Trump has also called on abolishing the tax on Social Security payments, a move that would be welcomed by retired Americans but would at the same time punch a big hole in the fund. The former president brought the era of US free trade to a juddering halt when he became president, but his tariffs on Chinese imports were largely retained and even expanded by Joe Biden. This time around he has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods with imports from China bearing the brunt at 60%. It is part of his attempt to promote homegrown manufacturers and stop outsourcing, but some economists have warned this could push up prices for consumers. During the presidential debate with Harris, Trump pointed out he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and that the Biden administration has not removed them. This tops his list of priorities as it did in 2016 when “Build the wall” was his signature slogan. The number of border crossings hit record levels at the end of 2023, but has fallen this election year. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the wall and increasing enforcement. He has also promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history. His vice-president pick, JD Vance, said they would start by removing a million people, but experts told the BBC that deportations on that scale would face huge legal and logistical challenges. There are also claims it could slow economic growth. Children of undocumented residents would no longer be eligible for citizenship under another Trump policy, although this would face significant legal obstacles. This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, and Trump has struggled to find a consistent message. The three judges he appointed while president were pivotal in the landmark decision, which Democrats have used to rally supporters as abortion restrictions have been introduced in numerous states. Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion. But in recent weeks he has tried to walk a tightrope, taking a more moderate stance while trying not to alienate his conservative base. He criticised Florida’s six-week ban, provoking an angry backlash, but also said he would oppose a ballot measure in the state establishing the right to an abortion. During the presidential debate he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. The Republican has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. ""I know Zelensky very well, and I know Putin very well,"" he said during the presidential debate. ""I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal."" Trump gave no details on what he thinks each side should give up in such a deal, and the Kremlin has said nothing can be done in 24 hours. Trump has also said he would stop the cash flowing to Ukraine. Mr Biden signed off $61bn in military aid for Ukraine in April. On Nato, he thinks countries that fall short of the advisory 2% of GDP spent on defence should forego the protection that comes with membership. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel and condemned pro-Palestinian supporters on US college campuses. But he has also at times been critical of the way Israel has conducted the war. He has said the war would not have happened if he had been president but offered no details on how he would end it. As president he angered Palestinians by moving the embassy to Jerusalem and his administration stopped calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which contravene international law, illegal. In his top 20 priorities, Trump promises not to cut Medicare, which is federally provided health insurance for older people. While president he tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the signature legislation of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people. He still criticises the law, which remains popular, but in March he said on Truth Social he would not undermine it. Recently he called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but it's unclear if such a large expense has the support of Republicans in Congress. He has pledged to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. His Republican policy platform vows to restore safety in neighbourhoods by replenishing police departments and protecting officers from “frivolous lawsuits”. Democrats point to his promise to pardon hundreds of convicted January 6 rioters as contradictory to his law-and-order stance. They also point to the fact violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and murders down by 13%, according to FBI data. As president, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, and protections for federal waterways. This time, he is again vowing to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry. He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars. And he has long railed against offshore wind farms, promising to halt this source of renewable energy as soon as he is elected.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl15ppvzgo,Six highlights from Harris-Trump debate,The 90-minute duel saw a volley of personal attacks as the rivals tussled over abortion and immigration.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Millions of viewers in the US watched Kamala Harris and Donald Trump duel for the first time, during a 90-minute debate broadcast live on ABC News on Tuesday night. Others are waking up to the aftermath of the presidential showdown. In case you missed the televised spectacle, here are the some of the highlights: As they walked out, Harris strode across the stage to Trump as he approached his podium. ""Kamala Harris,"" she said, offering a handshake as the pair met for the first time ever. “Let’s have a good debate.” “Nice to see you. Have fun,” the former Republican president said. It was the first handshake in a presidential debate in eight years. Harris spent the majority of the debate looking directly at her opponent, often smirking, laughing out loud, or shaking her head incredulously while he answered questions. The split screen showed Trump staring mostly straight ahead as she spoke, while occasionally shaking his head. Vice-President Harris, a Democrat, went on the offensive from the outset, goading her Republican rival and assailing him over his criminal trials and his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. She also accused her opponent of consistently using the issue of race to ""divide the American people"". The barb followed a question from the moderators about one recent attack in which he said Harris had ""become a black person"". Trump turned the subject repeatedly back to inflation and immigration, political vulnerabilities for Harris.  He argued that the Biden-Harris administration had “destroyed” the country, and labelled her a ""Marxist"", nodding to her father, a professor of economics. Harris poked fun at crowd sizes at his rallies. ""People start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom,"" she said. Trump hit back: “People don’t go to her rallies. There's no reason to go.” At one stage, when Harris interrupted Trump, he said: ""I'm talking now. Does that sound familiar?"" He was referring to a similar riposte she made in a 2020 vice-presidential debate against Mike Pence. Later, as Harris spoke over him, Trump said: “Quiet please.” Trump also blamed heated Democratic rhetoric for the assassination attempt against him in July by a gunman whose motives are unknown. “I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things they said about me,” he said. In the hours before the debate, social media was filled with reports of unsubstantiated claims - repeated by JD Vance, Trump's running mate, that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been stealing pets and eating them. Despite city officials telling the BBC there are no credible reports to support these claims, Trump brought up the matter in the debate. ""They're eating the dogs, they're eating the cats, they're eating the pets of the people that live there. This is a shame,"" he said. ""Talk about extreme,"" Harris said of her rival.  Read more on the BBC fact-check on the Springfield claims here. Some of Harris’s most aggressive attacks on Trump came as they clashed on abortion, one of the biggest issues for Democrats since the US Supreme Court overturned a constitutional right to the procedure in 2022. “One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government - and Donald Trump, certainly - should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said. She said Trump would ""sign an abortion ban"" if re-elected and cited conservative states that prohibit the procedure while allowing limited exceptions.  Trump, for whom the issue is a political liability, countered: ""What she says is an absolute lie. I am not in favour of an abortion ban."" Trump reiterated that he supports exceptions for cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. At one point Trump claimed that some babies were being subjected to “executions” after birth. One of the ABC moderators interceded to fact-check him, saying: “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.” Trump said Harris had no policies, accusing her of copying some of his own ideas on the campaign trial and that he was ""going to send her a Maga hat"", while also arguing she would be no different from President Biden. “She has no policy,"" he said. “Remember this, she is Biden,” he said at another point. Harris countered: “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden.” Trump, who while president tried to overturn to Obamacare, was asked what would be his plan now to replace the Affordable Care Act. He said he had ""concepts of a plan"" that would be ""something that's better"", if elected. On the economy, an issue that opinion polls show favours Trump, Harris repeatedly stated: ""I have a plan."" In the exchange that followed Harris's insistence that she had a plan for the economy, Trump sought to depict his rival as a radical liberal who was also opposed to gun ownership. He said: ""She has a plan to defund the police. She has a plan to confiscate everyone's guns. She has a plan to ban fracking in Pennsylvania and everywhere else."" Harris denied all this.  ""[Running mate] Tim Walz and I are both gun owners,"" she said. ""We're not taking anybody's guns away."" She has spoken of her gun ownership in the past - but is a supporter of tougher laws.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2373mz3k2o,Kamala Harris's pain-free campaign faces first crunch moment,"She avoided the challenges and scrutiny of a bitter Democratic primary, so Tuesday's debate entails even higher stakes.",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In American politics it’s customary to suggest that most voters don’t start paying attention to the presidential election until after the Labor Day holiday weekend. Well, that occasion - seen here as the unofficial end of summer - has now been and gone. And as a noticeable chill is felt in the air, many more voters will start to take note of politics. That includes the crucial swing voters in a handful of closely contested states who will ultimately decide the race for the White House. Right on cue, as these eyes start to focus on the election, we have a presidential debate that will see Donald Trump and Kamala Harris go head-to-head for the first time. In fact, it will be the first time the two candidates have ever met in person. The high-stakes event in Philadelphia on Tuesday night is expected to draw in tens of millions of viewers. Many of these viewers will be getting a first look at Ms Harris beyond the comfort of a rally stage. Before she dramatically replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in July, Ms Harris’s national profile was unusually low despite her serving as vice-president for almost four years. And make no mistake, her explosion on to the big stage so late in the election cycle is highly, highly unusual. The normal rhythms of American politics allow candidates to introduce themselves to the country as they campaign for their party’s presidential nomination in primary contests held much earlier in the year. This process weeds out those who, while popular in their home states, are not ready or equipped to take the leap on to the national stage (see Ron DeSantis) and gives participants vital experience at campaigning and debating. Ms Harris did none of that this year. When she ran for the Democratic nomination in 2019, she pulled out before a single primary vote was cast after a campaign dogged by poor messaging, in which she struggled to sell her own vision. Yet, this time around, it appears that Ms Harris’s unusual anonymity may in fact be a secret superpower. She has been able to present herself to America on her own terms, highlighting her relatively humble background, her record as a prosecutor and her promise to uphold what she sees as fundamental rights such as access to abortion. Ms Harris has also positioned herself as the candidate of change - a fresh face for the future - even though she has been part of the current administration for almost four years. Trump is attacking her as a dangerously radical liberal. But to do so he is relying on statements she made and policies she promoted when she was competing in Democratic primaries in 2019. That’s because, to win the Democratic nomination, candidates have to appeal to more liberal members of the party before then trying to move to the centre in the general election. In this election, Ms Harris did not have to compete against members of her own party to win the nomination and so had no reason to adopt more liberal policy positions as she did in the past. Just look at her failed bid in 2019, when she advocated for a ban on fracking and offshore drilling as well as universal free healthcare. Both ideas have been rapidly dropped this time around. Of course, we don’t know what promises Ms Harris would have made in a 2024 primary process, but to win the support of progressives she may well have taken similar positions to the above that Trump would now be using to attack her. No primary contest means less ammunition for the former president. And relying on statements his opponent made five years ago, and policy positions she has since dropped, is blunting his attacks. This week, Ms Harris announced tax proposals that differentiate her platform from what President Biden was promising. She is calling for a lower tax hike than Mr Biden proposed on the investment earnings of Americans making more than $1 million a year. That is not the sort of idea that would have won her support in any Democratic primary vote. There are arguably downsides to entering the race at such a late stage, however. Competing for the nomination would have given Ms Harris more experience with unscripted appearances - press conferences, interviews and TV debates. So far, she has done only one major broadcast interview since President Biden stepped aside and that was a joint appearance with her running mate Tim Walz. That encounter on CNN wasn’t exactly a tough interrogation, and she still struggled to answer what she would do on day one of the job if elected. At her vast rallies and during her well-received speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, Ms Harris relied on a teleprompter and familiar lines. The 90-minute debate on Tuesday will be her longest unscripted appearance in this campaign. Trump, who is far more experienced on the presidential debate stage, will try to knock her off her prepared talking points and do what has yet to happen in the race: press Ms Harris aggressively on policy and her changing positions. And Ms Harris knows better than anyone that the last time Trump took to the debate stage his opponent ended up leaving the race. For America’s surprise presidential candidate, who has completely avoided the challenges and scrutiny of a Democratic primary, this debate represents a sterner test than anything she has faced so far in this pain-free campaign.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4ypkpx1rqo,India’s Bangladesh dilemma: What to do about Sheikh Hasina?,Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina's continued presence in India means new diplomatic challenges for Delhi.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It’s been nearly a month since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina hurriedly landed at a military base near Delhi after a chaotic exit from her country.  Ms Hasina’s dramatic ouster on 5 August followed weeks of student-led protests which spiralled into deadly, nationwide unrest. She was initially expected to stay in India for just a short period, but reports say her attempts to seek asylum in the UK, the US and the UAE have not been successful so far.  Her continued presence in India has generated challenges for Delhi in developing a strong relationship with the new interim government in Dhaka.  For India, Bangladesh is not just any neighbouring country. It's a strategic partner and a close ally crucial to India's border security, particularly in the north-eastern states.  The two countries share a porous border 4,096km (2,545 miles) long which makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India’s north-eastern states to cross into Bangladesh for a safe haven.  After Ms Hasina's Awami League party came to power in 2009, it cracked down on some of these ethnic militant groups. Ms Hasina also amicably settled several border disputes with India.   While border security is at the core of the relationship, there are financial aspects too. During Ms Hasina's 15-year rule, trade relations and connectivity between the two countries flourished. India has gained road, river and train access via Bangladesh to transport goods to its north-eastern states.  Since 2010, India has also given more than $7bn (£5.3bn) as a line of credit to Bangladesh for infrastructure and development projects.  Ms Hasina’s sudden exit means that Delhi has to work hard to ensure that these gains are not lost.  “It’s a setback in the sense that any turbulence in our neighbourhood is always unwanted,” says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, a former Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka.  But the former diplomat insists that Delhi will work with the interim government in Dhaka because “there is no choice” and “you can’t dictate what they do internally”.  The Indian government has wasted no time in reaching out to the interim government in Dhaka, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding a telephone conversation with leader Muhammad Yunus. However, it will take a while for Delhi to assuage the anger in Bangladesh over its unwavering support for Ms Hasina and her Awami League for the last 15 years.   Many Bangladeshis attribute the anger against India to Delhi's swift endorsement of three controversial elections won by Ms Hasina's party amid allegations of widespread vote-rigging.  With Ms Hasina’s fall, Delhi’s “neighbourhood first” policy has taken another jolt with Bangladesh joining the Maldives and Nepal in resisting any attempt at dominance by India.  Analysts say that Delhi can’t afford to lose its influence in another neighbouring country if it wants to protect its status as a regional powerhouse - especially as rival China is also jostling for influence in the region.  Just last year, Mohamed Muizzu won the presidency in the Maldives on the back of his very public anti-India stand.  “It’s time for India to do some introspection regarding its regional policy,” says Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka.  Delhi needs to look at whether it has adequately taken on board the perspectives of its regional partners, he says.  “I am not only talking about Bangladesh, [but also] almost all other countries in the region,"" adds Mr Bhattacharya, who heads a committee appointed by the interim government to prepare a white paper on the state of Bangladesh’s economy. For example, in the case of Bangladesh, analysts point out that successive Indian governments have failed to engage with other opposition parties, particularly the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).  “India somehow thought that the Awami League and its government are the only allies inside Bangladesh. That was a strategic blunder,” says Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior leader of the BNP.   If free and fair elections are held in Bangladesh in the coming months, BNP leaders are confident of victory.  That will pose a diplomatic challenge for Delhi. There is a perceived trust deficit between India and the BNP, which is led by Begum Khaleda Zia, who had been prime minister for two terms earlier.  Ms Zia, who spent most of her time in jail since 2018, has always denied corruption charges against her and has accused Ms Hasina of political vendetta. She has now been released from jail and is recovering from her illness.   In the coming days, Delhi and the BNP leaders will have to find a way to work past their differences. During the previous BNP-led coalition government from 2001 to 2006, the bilateral relationship deteriorated with Delhi accusing Dhaka of harbouring insurgents from India’s north-east. During Ms Zia's rule, Hindu leaders in Bangladesh said there were a series of attacks against them - including murder, looting and rape - by Islamist parties and the BNP which began as the election results were announced in 2001.  The BNP denies the charges of giving shelter to anti-Indian insurgents and also of carrying out attacks on minority Hindus in 2001. BNP leaders, including Mr Khan, say India hasn't been forthcoming in engaging with them, adding that ""now it’s time for a policy shift on the part of Delhi”.  He also stresses that given India’s proximity, population, geographical size and its growing economic and military might, a party like the BNP cannot afford to make the mistake of harbouring any anti-Indian insurgents within Bangladesh. There are other factors also behind the anger against India. India and Bangladesh share 54 rivers and the sharing of water resources is a contentious issue. The recent floods triggered by heavy rains in eastern Bangladesh are an example of how misinformation can fuel suspicions between the two countries.  Following a sudden heavy downpour in the Indian state of Tripura, the excess water flowed into the Gumti river - which flows between the two countries - inundating vast areas inside the state as well as downstream in neighbouring Bangladesh.   Millions of people were affected with many losing their houses, belongings and farmland. Many villagers and social media users accused India of deliberately releasing water from a dam in the night, leading to the floods.  The Indian external affairs ministry was forced to issue a statement denying this, explaining that the floods had been caused by heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Gumti river.  Then there is another factor - China. Beijing is keen to extend its footprint in Bangladesh as it battles for regional supremacy with India.  It rolled out the red carpet for Mr Muizzu when he chose China for his first state visit after winning the Maldives election. Delhi would want to avoid the same fate with Bangladesh. And it would hope that Bangladesh’s reliance on Indian goods and trade will buy it some time to work out its diplomatic strategy and change its image.  So Delhi will have to tread carefully around Ms Hasina’s presence in India, especially if the new government makes a formal extradition request. A statement issued on her behalf by her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy last month had already stoked anger in Bangladesh.  But India wouldn’t want to ask Ms Hasina to leave the country when her future remains uncertain and come across as leaving a formidable former ally in the lurch.  “It doesn’t matter how she is accorded hospitality in India.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgw9dg55l9o,RFK Jr sues to remove name from North Carolina ballot,"In a shift, Robert F Kennedy Jr is now fighting to remove his name from ballots after endorsing Trump.",1 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has sued North Carolina’s election board to get his name off the state’s ballot ahead of November's US presidential election, just months after he fought to have his name included in several states. Mr Kennedy filed the lawsuit on Friday after the North Carolina Election Board denied his request to remove his name as a third-party candidate. The former independent candidate suspended his campaign in August and endorsed the Republican nominee, former president Donald Trump. Since then, he has fought to remove his name from ballots in several battleground states, saying he wants to avoid a Democratic win in those key races. The lawsuit, filed in North Carolina’s Wake County Superior Court, alleges the state has “irreparably harmed” Mr Kennedy and interfered with his right to free speech by denying his request to be removed from the ballot. Mr Kennedy’s lawsuit stated that with ballot deadlines looming, he had “no choice but to turn to this Court for immediate relief”. The state’s majority Democratic board voted to deny his request earlier in the week, saying it would be impractical to remove him as some counties have already begun printing absentee ballots. A reprint, they said, would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The two Republican members on the board disagreed, and argued that the state could delay the statutory deadline for absentee ballots being sent out. Mr Kennedy’s name will appear on North Carolina’s ballot in November unless the court intervenes. Similar requests by Mr Kennedy to have his name taken off ballots in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin have also been denied. These requests mark a reversal for Mr Kennedy, who earlier this year fought against legal challenges that would have removed him from the ballot in several states, including in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Nevada. After his withdrawal from the race, the 70-year-old has said that he will work to remove his name in “battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler”. Since suspending his campaign, Mr Kennedy has thrown his support behind Trump, who has vowed to appoint Mr Kennedy as a member of his presidential transition team should he get elected. Mr Kennedy, who had been a member of the Democratic party for most of his life, added that “by staying on the ballot in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats, with whom I disagree on the most existential issues”. Meanwhile, he is trying to remain on the ballot in New York - a traditionally Blue state that favours Democratic candidates - where his presence likely would not alter the election’s outcome."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjlxdlp5qpo,Harris agrees to muted mic rule in debate with Trump,The first debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will take place on 10 September.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has agreed to the rules of the upcoming TV debate against her opponent Donald Trump, including allowing mics to be muted when it is the other person’s turn to speak. Ms Harris's campaign previously fought the muted mics rule, which was agreed by her predecessor in the presidential contest, Joe Biden. Analysts suggested Ms Harris's team believed the rule would benefit Trump. But on Wednesday, both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to the ground debate rules set out by host network ABC News. The debate, scheduled for 10 September in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will be the first showdown between the two as presidential nominees. Its rules are similar to that of the June debate between President Joe Biden and Trump, hosted by CNN, in which Mr Biden’s poor performance led to a chorus of calls asking him to step down from the Democratic Party’s nomination. Political watchers suggested at the time that the muted mics rule used in that debate may have benefited Trump, as it limited his ability to interrupt Mr Biden and speak off-the-cuff, and helped him deliver a more measured performance. In a letter to ABC on Wednesday, the Harris campaign said it still believed it would be “fundamentally disadvantaged” by the debate’s format, saying it would “serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the vice-president.” But the campaign added that it was accepting the rules so that the debate could go ahead. “We understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,” it said. “For this reason, we accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphone.” The Trump campaign said in a statement it was “thrilled that Kamala Harris and her team of Biden campaign leftovers” have “accepted the already agreed-upon rules.” Trump himself, however, previously indicated that he would accepted un-muted mics. He attacked host network ABC in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, questioning its polling and saying it was “the worst network in terms of fairness”.  He said he had only agreed to the debate “because (Ms Harris's campaign) wouldn’t do any other network.” The debate is set to run for 90 minutes and will be held at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia. It will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Both candidates will not be giving opening statements, and they are not allowed to communicate with their campaign staff during commercial breaks. Like the CNN debate, there will be no live audience inside the venue."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nx3zdp4eo,SNP policies will not 'move dial' on child poverty - charity,Campaigners have criticised John Swinney as the Greens signal they will not support the government's budget.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Scottish government's policies will not ""move the dial"" on child poverty, campaigners have warned after the first minister said it was his top priority.  Mr Swinney was also criticised for ditching a commitment to expand free school meals in his new programme for government. Save the Children Scotland said the programme was missing the ""funded pledges"" to meet child poverty targets.  The Scottish Greens, who are also angry about cuts to environmental initiatives, have hinted they will not support the upcoming budget. The Scottish government has said its finances are ""extremely constrained"". Ministers have announced £500m of cuts as they aim to plug an almost £1bn hole in public finances.  In his spending plans for the coming year, Mr Swinney said eradicating child poverty it would be his administration's ""moral compass"" and promised ""a system of whole family support"".  He told MSPs the government had committed £3bn a year to eradicating poverty and mitigating the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis. The first minister also vowed to invest nearly £1bn a year in “affordable, high-quality and funded” early learning and childcare. The latest figures show that 26% of children are living in relative poverty in Scotland, despite targets to reduce it below 18% by the end of the financial year, and to 10% by 2030-31. Fiona King, senior policy and public affairs manager at Save the Children Scotland, welcomed the priority for child poverty, but called for more action.  She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: “The reality is there is nothing in this programme for government that truly shifts the dial on child poverty. “And we’re concerned we do not know what the roadmap is to get us to 2030."" Ms King said she was ""disappointed"" by the decision to scrap a commitment to provide free school meals to all P6 and P7 pupils. ""We can’t have a thriving economy if one in four children are living in poverty,"" she said.  “However hard this is for the Scottish government it is much, much harder for the families that can’t afford to put food on the table.” Ms King praised the Scottish Child Payment - a weekly payment of £26.70 to low-income households for every child under 16  - but called for it to be raised to £30 this year, and up to £40 by 2026. And while she recognised the Scottish government was facing a difficult financial situation, she criticised the decision to spend almost £150m on a council tax freeze.  ""That wasn’t an anti-poverty measure it didn’t help the poorest households,"" she said.  Citizens Advice Scotland also welcomed the prioritisation of child poverty, but called for more resources and “meaningful” collaboration between parties. Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes told BBC Radio Scotland that public finances were “extremely constrained” and accused the UK government of imposing austerity. Sir Keir Starmer's administration has said it would make ""tough decisions"" to address a £22bn hole in public finances when it announces its budget next month. Ms Forbes said: “We know that things are tough. “We are trying to push every penny as far as possible to focus on this mission. “Do we have more to do? Absolutely, which is why it was a priority in the programme for government.” She pointed to figures that suggest 100,000 children are being kept out of poverty by the Scottish Child Payment. The finance secretary insisted that while ministers were still aiming to provide universal primary school meals, they could not do so until more funding ""becomes available"". Primary school meals are already provided to all pupils in P1 to P5, and the Scottish government previously committed to expanding that to P6 and P7 by 2026.  However, the programme for government pledges only to provide meals to P6 and P7 pupils who receive the Scottish Child Payment.  This year’s Scottish budget announcement, planned for 4 December, will provide more detail on the SNP's spending plans. It be the first since the party ended a power-sharing agreement with the Greens. It left the SNP administration with a minority in parliament.  To pass the budget, some opposition MSPs would have to either back it or abstain when it comes to a vote early next year.  The Scottish Greens have supported every government budget since 2016.  But they have criticised decisions to roll back on several measures - including cutting a nature restoration fund and the active travel budget and ending a pilot that scrapped peak rail fares.  The Greens also condemned the government over free school meals, and for altering a commitment to ending conversion practices.  The party's education spokesperson, Ross Greer, told BBC Radio Scotland: “You don’t secure the support of Green MSPs by ditching, cutting, reversing the things that we care about. “I really struggle to see how we are in a similar situation now to what we were in that last session of parliament.” He added: ""If we can’t even get previous agreements delivered, how can we possibly trust them to deliver on any new agreement that we would reach later this year.""  After First Minister’s Questions, Mr Swinney said his government had to “engage constructively” with other parties.  “We've got to find people who work with us to get a budget passed,” he told reporters. “And I've got a wee bit of experience of doing that type of stuff over the years, and most of it successful."" The SNP leader said a budget had to be agreed to ensure public services received funding on time. He added: “Or there could be an election but then I don't think members of the public particularly want politicians to go having elections when they're not supposed to have them.” The SNP currently have 62 MSPs - excluding John Mason, who has been stripped of the party whip.  They would need 65 votes for a majority to pass the budget.  If the vote ends in a tie at stage one, the presiding officer's casting vote - which traditionally goes ""in favour of the status quo"" - would let the bill proceed, to allow talks to continue. But if there is a tie in the final vote, the ""status quo"" would be the existing budget arrangements - so Alison Johnstone would vote the new budget down. If the parliament is completely deadlocked, it is possible that an election would have to be called to break it."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n1g4gzypo,Tim Walz unharmed after vehicles in motorcade crash,Some journalists and campaign staff were injured but the candidate for vice-president was not hurt.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Multiple cars travelling in the motorcade carrying Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice-president, crashed in Milwaukee.  Mr Walz was not hurt. The crash happened around 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT) on Monday. The cars involved were at the rear of the motorcade and were carrying members of the press who travel with Mr Walz. Reporters said they were ""violently thrown forward"" after being hit from behind, sending their vehicle into the car in front of them. At least one person was injured. It is unclear what caused the crash, which occurred on Interstate 794. Vice-President Kamala Harris, his running mate, phoned Mr Walz to check that he was OK, a White House official told CBS, the BBC's US partner. Mr Walz said he also received a call from President Joe Biden. One person appeared to have broken an arm and was being treated by medics, according to a pool reporter travelling with Mr Walz. The affected vehicles pulled over to the side of the road as Mr Walz continued ahead to a scheduled appearance. Mr Walz addressed the incident in his remarks at a Milwaukee Labor Day event shortly after the crash.  ""Some of my staff and members of the press that were travelling up with us were involved in a traffic accident on the way here today. We’ve spoken with the staff,"" he told the crowd. ""I’m relieved to say that with a few minor injuries, everybody’s going to be okay.” Mr Walz thanked the Secret Service and local first responders ""for their quick reaction to help"". Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance also responded to the reports, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, ""Hoping everyone's OK."" It's not the first time the campaign has faced a motorcade-related crash.  Last week, a Georgia policeman crashed his motorcycle while travelling with the campaign convoy.  The officer, Savannah Police Corporal David Bates, was the only person involved in the crash and sustained ""serious injuries"".  NPR reported that motorcade vehicles are often driven by campaign staff who may or may not have professional driving experience. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02w01xr2jo,German far right hails 'historic' election victory in east,Germany's anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany is on course for victory in Thuringia.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Germany's anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) is celebrating a ""historic success"", with a big victory for the far-right party in the eastern state of Thuringia. The AfD won almost a third of the vote, nine points ahead of the conservative CDU, and far in front of Germany's three governing parties. The result gives the far right its first win in a state parliament election since World War Two, although it has little hope of forming a government in Thuringia because other parties are unlikely to work with it. The AfD came a close second in Sunday's other big state election, in the more populous neighbouring state of Saxony.  Results there gave the CDU 31.9% of the vote, just ahead of the AfD, again far ahead of the three parties running the national government - the Social Democrats, Greens and liberal FDP. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the results were ""bitter"" and called on other mainstream parties to form state governments without the far right.  ""The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country's reputation,"" he said in a statement to Reuters. The AfD's top candidate in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, who is a highly controversial figure in Germany, hailed a ""historic victory"" and spoke of his great pride. He failed to win a direct mandate for the state parliament, but secured a seat because he was top of his party list. Mr Höcke's party has been designated as right-wing extremist and he has been fined for using a Nazi slogan, although the former history teacher denies knowingly doing so. One of Germany's best-known Holocaust survivors, Charlotte Knobloch, pointed out that the election had taken place 85 years to the day since the outbreak of World War Two. The result had left the country in danger of becoming ""more unstable, colder and poorer, less safe and less worth living in"", she said. With federal elections only a year away, the AfD is second in national opinion polls. Co-leader Alice Weidel said the result was a ""requiem"" for the three parties running Germany and it was clear that voters in both eastern states wanted her party in government. ""Without us a stable government is no longer possible at all,"" she said. That message was repeated by Björn Höcke, who suggested there were plenty of CDU voters who would be happy if they worked together. Without the support of other parties, the AfD cannot govern in Thuringia, and the CDU has made clear it will not consider ruling with the far right.  Mathematically, the conservatives will need support from parties on the left to form a majority. Some five million Germans in the east were eligible to vote on Sunday and, according to a survey for public broadcaster ZDF, 36% of under-30s in Thuringia voted for the AfD, far more than any other party. The biggest issue for AfD voters on Sunday was immigration, and in particular the issue of refugees and asylum.  “Politicians have promised a lot, particularly concerning migration and foreigners,"" AfD voter Michael told the BBC in Thuringia's state capital, Erfurt. ""But nothing happened. Nothing. Just promises came from these parties. Now I have my party. And I stand with my decision,"" he said, standing beside his partner Manuela, who agreed that people wanted change. The asylum issue was re-ignited nationally little more than a week before the vote, when three people were murdered at a street festival at Solingen in western Germany, and a Syrian man facing deportation was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack. AfD deputy leader Beatrix von Storch told the BBC's Newshour programme that political opponents had been attacking her party's asylum policies as extremist for years. ""Two days ahead of the election they started to do what we always said had to be done,"" she said, referring to a series of government measures aimed at toughening asylum laws. The AfD also wants to stop weapons supplies to Ukraine, as does a new party heading for third place in both states, left-wing populist leader Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW. Although she has similar ideas to the AfD on Ukraine, Ms Wagenknecht has, like the other parties, refused to take part in any coalition with the far right. Provisional results in Thuringia give the AfD 32 seats in the 88-seat Thuringia state parliament, and the CDU 23 seats, with only one of the three parties in the national government represented.  That gives the AfD more than a third of the seats, handing it a blocking minority on decisions that require a two-thirds majority, including changes to the state constitution or appointing judges. Chancellor Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) is set to win just six seats, with none for the Greens and liberal FDP.  In Saxony, the conservatives won 42 seats, just ahead of the AfD with 41, while Sahra Wagenknecht's party is in third with 15 seats. Sunday's elections have underlined the unpopularity of Germany's ruling ""traffic-light"" coalition, so named because of the red, yellow and green of the party colours.  A third eastern state, Brandenburg, is due to vote in three weeks' time and although the AfD is ahead in the opinion polls, the Social Democrats and conservatives are only a few points behind. While Björn Höcke hailed his party's victory with supporters in Erfurt, anti-AfD protesters gathered outside the Thuringia state parliament. The AfD has been classified as right-wing extremist by domestic intelligence in Thuringia as well as Saxony. In May, a German court ruled that the BfV intelligence agency was justified in placing the AfD under observation for suspected extremism. Among the protesters was Hannah, a local student, who said she was very worried by the result: ""I think there are a lot of people who are aware they have Nazi policies and don't care. Germany has some kind of responsibility on that matter."" The rise of Sahra Wagenknecht's populist party had a direct impact on the Left party, which won the last election in Thuringia but has now slipped into fourth place. Bodo Ramelow, the Left-party state premier of Thuringia, who had led a coalition with the SPD and Greens, said the election campaign had been characterised by fear and that he was ""fighting against the normalisation of fascism""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx1vr83ldo,France on charm offensive as New Caledonia simmers,A proposed voting reform had sparked deadly protests in the French overseas territory in May.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"For the Pacific Islands, climate change, geopolitics and security have often been the bread and butter of any summit. But at this year’s Pacific Island Forum Leader’s Meeting - the region’s biggest diary event - there was another hot topic thrown into the mix: that of New Caledonia and the unrest that hit the French overseas territory back in May. A controversial French proposal to extend voting rights to people who had lived on the islands for more than 10 years sparked deadly protests. Eleven people have since died – nine civilians and two French gendarmes - and there are still French police on the ground. President Emmanuel Macron visited New Caledonia and, in June, halted the reform.  But tensions remain high, with a growing push towards independence among the Indigenous Kanaks, who make up 41% of the population. The French have said they want to set the record straight. They were on a PR mission in Tonga, where leaders from all 18 island nations and territories gathered this past week, including New Caledonia’s President Louis Mapou. But small island nations were sceptical - the violence in New Caledonia had seen support for the French wane. And many saw it as an attempt by France to hold on to a strategic part of the world where the US and China were fighting for sway. “We’ve seen lots of nice press about the French delegation throughout this week,” Véronique Roger-Lacan, France’s ambassador to the Pacific, said on Thursday, breaking into an ironic laugh. She was holding a press briefing that had been heavily publicised, her team consistently encouraging media to attend. She made it clear they were there to answer questions and show transparency in what had been a bruising few months not just for New Caledonia but for France’s reputation in the region. The French delegation attended as a ""dialogue partner"" - one of 21 such countries with interests in the region, inlcuding Washington and Beijing. As an overseas French territory, New Caledonia's defence, foreign affairs and policing are coordinated by France. To many here, it looked like France was chaperoning the pro-independence leader. “Being a country in the Pacific we can feel that we are part of a community of challenges,” François-Xavier Léger, the French Ambassador to Fiji, said at the briefing. And before that, Ambassador Roger-Lacan said that ""New Caledonia is France"". These comments ruffled feathers at the forum, where there was much discussion of decolonisation and independence. “In making this kind of statement, it’s not really helping the discussion,” said Reverend Billy Wetewea, a pastor at the Protestant Church of Kanaky who also attended the forum. Reverend Wetewea has worked with many of the Kanaky youth in New Caledonia who led the protests. “I don’t justify the violence, but I think it can be explained through social dynamics,” he said, adding that years of inequality in education, health and social issues had taken their toll. New Caledonia is on the United Nation’s list of non-self-governing territories - countries the UN monitors in their progress towards independence. France has been clear it is following the steps towards decolonisation. The Nouméa Accord, signed in 1998, put the territory onto a path of more autonomy. The intention was that over a 20-year period, a more independent New Caledonia would emerge. Three referendums were also tabled. In the first, held in 2018, voters rejected independence by 56.7%. Then in 2020, there was a narrower victory for the anti-independence side - 53%. In 2021, independence parties boycotted the final referendum, arguing that the vote was being rushed through. The Covid pandemic had made campaigning impossible and Indigenous Kanaks were still taking part in rituals to bury their dead. Unsurprisingly, the pro-France side won with an overwhelming majority. That last referendum has set the tone for the past few years of strain between France and the Kanaks, who feel that France playing isn't fair in their path to decolonisation. When asked by the BBC what France could do to change that view, Ambasssador Roger-Lacan was resolute they are doing everything by the book. “This is the ongoing job in New Caledonia with you all in the press,” she said. “Things have to be portrayed in a neutral manner, everywhere, disinformation has to be stopped, right information has to be put to the people on this self-determination and democratic process.” While France may blame the media for not reporting their side, many here blamed France’s tone – and questioned their interests. “They want to maintain their presence in the Pacific geopolitically [with] the fear of China taking over the Pacific,” Reverend Billy Wetewea said. China sent its largest-ever delegation to the forum this year. And the US delegation was led by Kurt Campbell, President Joe Biden’s Deputy Secretary of State, widely credited as the architect of Washington’s recent alliance-building in Asia. France’s position in the Pacific was brought into sharp focus in 2021, when Australia cancelled a multi-billion dollar contract with a French firm to build nuclear submarines. Instead it signed a new, key defence pact with the US and the UK. This, researcher Benoît Trépied said, altered France’s approach with New Caledonia: “Suddenly there was a huge new interest of French officials in the Pacific. [The] colonial, imperial reflex which was – no, if we want to be powerful in the Pacific, New Caledonia has to stay French. Period.” Despite the stand-off, this week’s meeting was fruitful. Leaders endorsed a planned fact-finding mission to visit New Caledonia, which was meant to happen earlier but disagreements over who was in control of the mission made the timing slip. But for Reverend Wetewea, there needs to be more dialogue. “They cannot take decisions without consulting the people,” he said. “If they make their own decisions, it will be really tense again. Now the youth want their voice to be heard.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05jvl65meno,Huge seat part of plans for more Senedd politicians,"A seat stretching 1,927 sq miles is in a map of constituencies for the next Senedd election.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A constituency that stretches from the Llŷn Peninsula coastline to Wales' border with England is among the proposals for the next Senedd election in 2026. From the next election, Wales will send 96 politicians to the Welsh Parliament - 36 more than now - with a new voting system that will have fewer and larger constituencies. Boundary commissioners have now published proposals for how the seats could work - with the largest seat as big as 1,927 sq miles (4,992 sq km). Created by pairing up Wales' 32 Westminster seats into 16 constituencies, the new boundaries cross many of the the country's existing administrative borders. Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Dafydd Wigley said he was ""horrified"" by the size of the new constituencies that had been recommended, questioning how a politician could represent such a big area. A Liberal Democrat MP feared the proposals ""will do little to rekindle people's falling faith in Welsh democracy"". But a Labour Senedd member said the pairings were ""fairly predictable"" and that the number of extra MSs will mean a ""broader representation"" in Cardiff Bay. Commissioners urged the public to give their views in their consultation, which runs until 30 September.  They said they considered transport links, local ties, shared history, the Welsh language and other socio-economic considerations to ""propose constituencies which feel as natural as possible"". Proposals will be revised again in December, and will be finalised next March. The map is temporary, and the result of a system designed to be drawn up quickly for the next election in 2026. There are plans to give a further review more time to draw up a fresh set of seats for the election after next in 2030, when the map is likely to be changed again with the commissioners given more flexibility. From 2026, the way the public votes for the Senedd will be totally reformed, abandoning the mixed system of first past the post and party lists that existed before. Currently there are 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs), elected through a mix of 40 first past the post constituencies and lists in the five regions. But under the new system, there will be 96 MSs, all voted via a system which aims to reflect better how people voted. To achieve that, there will be 16 constituencies instead of the 40 there are now, electing six politicians each through party lists. To get things ready quickly, with the next election less than two years away, without having to draw a map from scratch, each constituency will be formed by pairing up the 32 seats for Westminster. The Westminster seats were themselves only drawn up in 2023, following a review that saw Wales lose eight seats with borders drawn larger to cover more equal numbers of people. The Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru was given the task to find the pairings. The only criteria it was given was that the two seats had to be ""contiguous"" - commissioners interpreted that as meaning there had to be a direct road link between them. In rural areas where fewer people live, the new system also means that some constituencies are geographically large. More proportional voting systems also tend to require larger seats.  The largest geographical constituency is Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr - a merger of the Westminster seats of the same names. Six MSs will serve an area the size of 1,927 sq miles (4,992 sq km) - stretching from the Llŷn Peninsula in the west to the border with England, covering parts of the counties of Gwynedd and Powys. The report by the commission admitted that it was ""not ideal to propose such a large constituency"". But it said it was the ""best option"" available - saying the alternative of merging Dwyfor Meirionnydd with Ceredigion Preseli, and Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, would have created two ""very large and unwieldly"" constituencies. Another large constituency is Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire - a merger of the Westminster seats of Ceredigion Preseli and Mid and South Pembrokeshire. It is 1,329 sq miles (3,444 sq km) in size.  More built-up areas are smaller - the smallest is Cardiff East and North, which covers some of the capital's most densely populated areas.  The requirement for a road to exist between two seats means that the Anglesey seat of Ynys Môn is being proposed for merger with Bangor Aberconwy because of the Menai crossings, as opposed to Dwyfor Meirionnydd. The city of Newport will be in one constituency in Newport and Islwyn, albeit with part of the valley stretching to its north west. Some of Wales' rural areas will share constituencies with the urban valleys - including Monmouthshire and Torfaen. Carmarthenshire will be a seat to itself, merged from Caerfyrddin and Llanelli. Meanwhile Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe - which was controversial at the last boundary review because of the inclusion of the Swansea Valley with the rural Brecon and Radnorshire - will be paired with Neath and Swansea East. The commission has used the names of the original Westminster seats where there is not a name in common use. It is seeking comment from the public on its own proposed names - with the longest, Brecon, Radnor, Neath and Swansea East, stretching to six words. The electorates likely to be similar in size, but not identical, in each constituency.  That's with the exception of Bangor Aberconwy Ynys Môn, however, because the small size of the Ynys Môn constituency was protected in the Westminister review, meaning the combined seat is likely smaller. The map is all part of the plan to reform the Senedd and elect more politicians in Cardiff Bay, originally penned by former first minister Mark Drakeford and ex-Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. The Senedd - and the Welsh government which is formed from it - have more powers than the predecessor National Assembly to make laws and set taxes. It's been a long standing complaint that the body is too small to cope with the task of scrutinising government, and needs to expand to reflect its responsibilities. Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru are both on board with the plan - but the Welsh Conservatives complained about the cost - an extra £18m a year on top of its £67m a year budget. Some who support the principle of a larger Senedd are worried about the way it will be elected, though a system known as closed lists. Voters will only be able to back a party, rather than a specific candidate - and there are concerns that will break the link between the electorate and the politicians themselves. Prof Laura McAllister said the ""closed lists"" system would put too much power in the hands of parties, and could erode trust with the public. There are plans for parties to be required to submit lists of candidates with at least 50% women, but they are delayed until the Senedd election in 2030. Voters will cast their votes to select a party list, rather than an individual candidate. In the new large constituencies, six MSs will be elected. A mathematical calculation called D'Hondt will be applied to the number of votes to decide who wins, and would be applied again and again until all the seats are allocated. The system was already used to decide who got the Senedd's regional spots. The votes of all the parties are divided by the number of seats they have won at that point in the process, plus one. In the first instance, the party with the largest number of votes wins the first seat.  But after the first is handed out, D'Hondt starts to have an impact. In an imaginary election where party A won 25,000 votes, party B won 15,000, and party C won 10,000, party A would win the first seat, and party B would win the second seat. Party A would win the third seat, but party C would win the fourth. By Gareth Lewis, political editor Wales’s electoral maps for Westminster elections and Senedd elections are now going to look radically different. There have already been concerns that the size of the 16 new constituencies will dilute our sense of ""belonging"" and that six MSs per constituency might dilute our personal connection with our politicians. This all comes at a time when the polls – and anecdotal conversations – suggest that we’re distinguishing more than ever before between what Westminster is in charge of and what the Senedd controls. So depending on your point of view, it’s either an optimum or a risky time to make fundamental change. One of the biggest tests of the new system might well be turnout. We have a new map, more MSs - and on current polling - electoral jeopardy for Labour, but will that see turnout over 50% in a Senedd election for the first time? Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Dafydd Wigley questioned how one member could represent such a large area as the proposed Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr constituency. ""How on earth does one member represent an area from Bardsey island to the border of England,"" he asked. ""The purpose of having elected members of the Welsh Parliament is to represent those areas. And if there is a large area with such severe differences in its industry, in its language, in its culture and in its way of life, what is going to suffer the most is the countryside and I believe that is completely unacceptable."" Mick Antoniw, who helped get the legislation for the Senedd reforms through the Welsh Parliament when he was counsel general, said the map was ""fairly predictable"". On BBC Radio Wales, the Labour MS for Pontypridd said the pairings make it ""easier to introduce a higher level of diversity and gender balance"" among the six Senedd members that will be elected from paired consistencies. ""It's one of the great difficulties in Wales because we have a very densely populated north and south, and we have this enormous rural area in the centre. ""We've always have had some constituencies that are absolutely enormous."" But he said with six representatives for each new constituency ""it will be far more possible that there's more broader representation of those areas than perhaps there has been in the past"". Welsh Conservative Shadow Minister for the Constitution Darren Millar said the expansion proposals were ""the wrong priority"". ""More boundary changes will cause yet further upheaval and confusion for those who have already had to contend with boundary changes in council and Westminster elections,"" he added. David Chadwick, Liberal Democrat MP for Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe, said: “I’m very concerned that these proposals will do little to rekindle people’s falling faith in Welsh democracy.  ""Many communities won’t recognise themselves in these proposals."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: ""Moves to strengthen Welsh democracy are long overdue.  ""From 2026, the people of Wales will be better represented, and the Welsh government can be more effectively scrutinised."" Reform UK, which has no Welsh seats in the Senedd or Westminster, is hoping the new Welsh Parliament will be an opportunity for the party. “Today’s announcement is an exciting one for Reform UK,"" chairman Zia Yusuf said, adding the party was building a ""local branch structure across the whole of Wales"". Chief executive of the commission, Shereen Williams, said: “We strongly encourage everyone to share their views with us, whether they support or oppose the proposals, so that we can go on to further strengthen the map ahead of the next election.”"

The Daily Telegraph reports that British criminals could serve their time in jails in Estonia under plans being considered by ministers to ease Britain's overcrowded prisons. It says the Baltic state has plenty of empty cells it wants to rent out and government sources are quoted as saying ""all viable options"" are being considered while the UK system is ""on the brink of collapse"".  The paper expected discussions to have taken place between ministers on Thursday but says the Prison Reform Trust called the idea half-baked. Germany is considering sending migrants who arrive in the country illegally to facilities in Rwanda paid for by the UK government, according to the Daily Mail. The idea has been floated by Joachim Stamp, Germany's special commissioner for migration agreements. The paper says Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick has said the proposal makes Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who scrapped the scheme after taking office in July, look ""more foolish by the day"". Number Ten tells the paper it stands by the decision and describes the scheme as a ""gimmick"". The Grenfell inquiry report continues to make headlines following its publication on Wednesday.  The Times says the architecture firm which was behind the refit of the Tower has been prevented from closing down while investigations into the disaster continue - despite being in liquidation for four years. It says the inquiry found that Studio E bore a ""very significant degree of responsibility"" because of the materials used in the refit and that it had a ""cavalier attitude to safety"".   The Guardian quotes a warning from a former chief prosecutor that justice for the 72 deaths may not come before the end of the decade. Lord McDonald tells the paper that the ""creaking justice system"" means any criminal trials may not begin before 2029. According to the Scottish Daily Mail, detectives have submitted the findings of their investigation into Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP's finances to prosecutors. It says police have made a formal request to Scotland's Crown Office asking what action to take next. Ms Sturgeon insists that she has done nothing wrong. The i reports that checks on fruit and vegetables being imported from the EU are to be delayed again amid fears they will push up food prices. The introduction of the checks was repeatedly pushed back under the previous government, and are now expected to be delayed again until July 2025, the paper says. The Times reports on medical evidence that backs up the traditional remedy of a salt water gargle to help cure coughs and colds in children. It says a scientific study has found that a homemade saline solution, used as nasal drops, could decrease the length of a childhood cold by two days. It also lowered the risk of passing on the infection. And the Daily Mirror says that a monument honouring Queen Elizabeth II is to be announced this weekend to coincide with the second anniversary of her death. The paper says the sculpture will be in St James's Park, which is overlooked by Buckingham Palace, and will be unveiled in 2026. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynd2mr5gjo,"US targets Islamic State in Iraq, killing 15","US Central Command says it targeted members of IS leadership in an effort to ""disrupt and degrade"" the group's plans.",31 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US says its military forces in Iraq have killed 15 Islamic State (IS) ""operatives"" in a joint operation with Iraqi Security Forces that targeted the militant group's leadership. US Central Command (Centcom) said it had performed the joint operation in western Iraq early on Thursday.  American and Iraqi troops were met by IS members equipped with ""numerous weapons, grenades and explosive 'suicide' belts"", it said in a statement. ""There is no indication of civilian casualties."" Meanwhile, US media quoted US defence officials as saying that seven American troops were injured. Centcom has not commented on this. The Iraqi military said in an earlier statement that ""air strikes targeted the hideouts, followed by an airborne operation"" in the country's ""desert and caves"".  “All hideouts, weapons, and logistical support were destroyed, explosive belts were safely detonated and important documents, identification papers and communication devices were seized.” The White House National Security Council and the Pentagon referred the BBC to Centcom for comment.  Centcom said it had targeted members of IS leadership in an effort to ""disrupt and degrade"" the group's ability to plan, organise and attack Americans, Iraqis and allies within and outside the region.  There are approximately 2,500 US troops currently in Iraq, though they remain there in an ""advise and assist"" capacity since the US military announced the end of its combat effort in the country in December 2021. Iraq announced on 15 August that it would postpone a planned end-date for the US military operations in the country. Thursday's operation follows a recent attack in Germany and a plot in Austria that are being investigated for their links to IS.  Authorities said that the suspect behind the planned attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna - a 19-year-old Austrian citizen - had pleged allegiance to the Islamic State before targeting the singer's Eras tour.  Intelligence provided by the CIA to Austrian authorities allowed them to disrupt the plot and save ""hundreds of lives"" , the agency's deputy director David Cohen said on Wednesday. It also follows an attack in Solingen, Germany, in which three people died and eight others were wounded. The attack has caused outrage in Germany ahead of state elections, and the murder suspect - Issa Al H, 26 - is being investigated for his links to IS.  Earlier this summer, the militant group took some responsibility for a rare shooting attack near a Shia Muslim mosque in Oman's capital, Muscat. Six people - including a policeman - were killed and 28 others injured. The Islamic State once had a strong foothold in Iraq and Syria, but a US-led coalition of more than 70 countries largely drove them out from the physical caliphate they had created there.  The BBC's Frank Gardner reported in June that intelligence-sharing between police forces and security agencies had largely quelled IS's co-ordinated attacks in European cities. But the jihadist propaganda it continues to produce online still has the ability to motivate extremists who are radicalised by it, he reported.  A senior Whitehall official in London described the status of the group as ""down but not out""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvvvl9zq4eo,What are the abortion laws in US states?,"Two years after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, access to abortion varies according to where you live.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Abortion rights are back in the spotlight in the US as the country heads into its presidential election between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and her Republican opponent Donald Trump.  The state of access in the US has been in flux for more than two years, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and rescinded the constitutional right to abortion.  The June 2022 decision returned control over the procedure back to individual states. Access now varies depending on where you are. Some states have enacted total bans, while others protect the procedure throughout pregnancy. This patchwork map of rights will change again after the November election. Exactly how it changes will depend on who wins.  Ms Harris has promised to ""restore"" abortion rights federally while Mr Trump has said recently he will leave the issue to states. Some states are also voting in referendums specifically on abortion.  Here's a look at where things stand, and how they might change.   In 1973, in a case called Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US Constitution up until the point of foetal viability, which is about 24 weeks. The landmark 7-2 decision established a framework to govern abortion based on a ""trimester"" system. In the first three months, or trimester, of pregnancy, women were granted an almost absolute right to abortion. In the second trimester it allowed regulations to protect women's health. And in the third, it allowed states to ban abortions as long as exceptions were made for the health and life of the mother.  This system remained in place for nearly 50 years, until the court overturned Roe and the nationwide constitutional right to abortion access.  There were just over one million legal abortions performed in the US in 2023 - the first full calendar year since Roe was overturned - according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group. This marked an 11% increase from 2020, and the first time since 2012 that more than 1 million abortions were recorded in the US.  Access to legal abortion in the US now depends on where you are. As of August 2024, 17 states have outlawed nearly all abortions, banning the procedure at six weeks of pregnancy or earlier. Some have narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or the health of the mother.  These states, including Texas, Florida, and Alabama, are under Republican control, with many clustered in the US South.  Another eight states allow some access to the procedure. These states bar abortion some time between 12 and 23 weeks of pregnancy. The remaining 25 states, plus the District of Columbia, protect abortion. Nine of these states as well as DC do not restrict abortion based on gestational duration.  This does not mean that anyone who wants an abortion at this stage can have one.  On the contrary, abortions after 21 weeks pregnancy are rare and difficult to obtain - representing just 1% of all abortions in the US, according to the non-profit health organisation KFF.  They are only performed by a small number of providers, KFF says, and are often related to medical concerns like foetal anomalies or threats to the life of the mother. Medication abortion is now the most common method of ending a pregnancy in the US and involves two drugs - mifepristone and misoprostol. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the two-step regimen for use up until 10 weeks of pregnancy.  Abortion bans cover both surgical and medication abortion, meaning healthcare providers in these states are prohibited from prescribing abortion pills. But in some cases, abortion medication has been used to circumvent these bans. Some medical professionals in abortion-friendly states have begun prescribing the pills and sending them by mail to patients in restrictive states.  In response, some states that oppose abortion are taking extra steps to curb the illegal use of abortion pills.  Yes. Polls show the majority of Americans - around two-thirds - support legal access to abortion. And the number of Americans who say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion has reached a record high of 32%.   This broad support for abortion is expected to benefit Vice-President Kamala Harris's bid for the White House. In the time since Roe was overturned, the issue has handed Democrats a series of unexpected wins, including in the 2022 midterm elections and the Virginia state elections.  And since taking over the reins from Joe Biden, Ms Harris has enthusiastically embraced reproductive rights as a key promise of her candidacy. She has promised to support legislation that would protect abortion rights nationally.   Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, campaigned in 2016 on appointing justices who would reverse Roe. He appointed three justices while in office, all of whom voted to overturn Roe. In recent months, Mr Trump has said he supports the authority of US states to govern abortion. Mr Trump has also faced scrutiny over the proposed abortion policies in Project 2025, a detailed blueprint for the next Republican administration. Mr Trump has disavowed the document, which was written by several alumni of the Trump White House.  Legal experts say the policies outlined in Project 2025 amount to a de facto national abortion ban.  Abortion itself will be also on the ballot in several states. So far, 11 states including Florida, Arizona, Maryland and Nebraska have confirmed referendums on abortion access for November. A large majority of countries allow abortion under at least some circumstances.  Most industrialised countries permit the procedure without restriction, according to the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR), a non-partisan thinktank, with the global trend in abortion law moving towards liberalisation.  In the last 30 years, more than 60 countries have changed their abortion laws and all but four - the US, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Poland - expanded legal access, the CFR said.  In Ireland, for example, parliament in 2018 legalised abortion before 12 weeks of pregnancy, and later in pregnancy when the mother's life is at stake.  In other western countries, abortion laws are comparable to US states that allow abortion at least until the second trimester.  Women in France are guaranteed abortion access until 14 weeks of pregnancy. In the UK, abortions can be carried out until 24 weeks of pregnancy, with abortions after that in limited circumstances, like if the mother's life is at risk. In Canada, there is no gestational limit on abortion.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgedv8w7qd7o,John McCain's son endorses Harris after Trump cemetery visit,The youngest son of late Republican Senator John McCain says he recently registered as a Democrat.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Jimmy McCain, son of the late Republican Senator John McCain, is endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris following controversy around Donald Trump's recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery.  He called Trump's visit last week to the military burial site ""a violation"".  The Army has accused a Trump staffer of pushing aside an Arlington employee as they tried to warn his team about rules against filming in the cemetery. The Trump campaign says it received permission from families of fallen service members to film video during an event to honour US soldiers killed during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. ""Show respect and leave. It doesn't need to be videoed,"" Mr McCain told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday.  He added: ""The point of Arlington Cemetery is to go and show respect for the men and women who have given their lives to this country. When you make it political, you take away the respect of the people who are there."" Mr McCain, who was previously an independent, said he has changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Ms Harris for president in November.  ""I feel that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz embody a group of people that will help make this country better. That will take us forward. That's really what matters at the end of the day,"" he said.  The youngest McCain son enlisted in the Marine Corps and has served as an intelligence officer since 2022. Three generations of McCain family are buried at Arlington.  Federal law prevents use of the site for political campaigning. The Trump campaign has disputed the cemetery's version of events and released a statement from the Gold Star military families that invited him to the site, saying the former president was there to honour the sacrifice of their relatives who were killed. Trump - who is the Republican candidate for a third time  - and late Senator McCain had a long rivalry. The Vietnam war hero was one of the most outspoken Republican critics of Trump from the very start of his first candidacy. Trump once attacked McCain, himself a former Republican presidential candidate, saying he was ""not a war hero"" because he was captured and held as a prisoner of war.  In 2020, McCain's widow, Cindy McCain, endorsed Joe Biden in his campaign to unseat Trump. Mr Biden later appointed her as US ambassador to a United Nations food agency. Jimmy McCain is not the only family member to withhold support for Trump.  His sister Meghan said on Monday she does not plan to support either Trump or Ms Harris.  “I greatly respect the wide variety of political opinions of all of my family members and love them all very much,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I however, remain a proud member of the Republican Party and hope for brighter days ahead."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86ld5z2ll7o,The school hostage massacre that exposed Putin's weakness,The roots of Putinism were already evident after the massacre of 334 people in a school in Russia in 2004.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The day Beslan began burying its dead, there were so many cars loaded with coffins that there was gridlock on the road to the cemetery. In the small Caucasus town, everyone had lost a relative or knew someone killed in the siege of School No. 1.  Launched by heavily armed militants, mainly from Chechnya, the terror attack lasted three days. Three hundred and thirty-four people died; 186 of them were children. It’s 20 years today since the siege ended suddenly in devastating explosions, but I can still hear the wailing of Beslan’s mothers; the grief that rolled over the town in waves. I can picture the white open coffin of 11-year-old Alina, laid out in her front yard with her dolls placed carefully beside her. And I will always remember Rima, who spent three days crammed into the stifling school gym with her grandchildren and hundreds of other hostages, bombs strung from the basketball hoops above them. Back then, she confessed that she was ashamed to have survived.  As she and her grandchildren ran for the exit, under fire, they had to climb over the dead body of a small boy. “God forgive us for that,” Rima begged, through streams of tears. In 2004, the suffering of Beslan was felt all over Russia and resonated all over the world. First and foremost, the tragedy was caused by the dozens of men and women who stormed the school, firing in the air and taking hundreds of petrified people hostage. They had rounded up mothers with babies and balloons, and little girls with big white bows in their hair. Whole families who had been celebrating the first day back to school. The militants stuffed the gym with explosives and began executing the male hostages. That summer, Vladimir Putin’s brutal war against separatists in Chechnya – launched four years earlier – had already burst beyond the borders of the southern Russian republic. The day before the Beslan siege, 10 people were killed when a Chechen woman blew herself up outside a Moscow metro station. Before that, suicide bombers blew two planes from the sky and there was a deadly attack on a music festival. But for two decades now there have been persistent, troubling questions about how Mr Putin and his officials handled the attack on Beslan in their determination not to ""give in"" to terrorists. Did they even try to negotiate?  Why claim the attackers made no political demands when they had called for Russian troops to pull out of Chechnya?  Could more children have been freed? Most critically, why did rescuers fire from tanks and use flamethrowers when there were still hundreds of hostages inside the school? To many, the siege of Beslan offered crucial early lessons in Putinism, including that he would spare nothing and no one to crush those who challenged him. It took 20 years for Mr Putin to visit the ruins of School No. 1. Even then, he didn’t join the anniversary events with the families. He only travelled there two weeks ago, alone. A few shattered walls of the school were left standing as a memorial, eventually encased in a gold-tinted shroud and hung with framed photographs of the dead.  There, in the middle of the gym where the hostages were held, Mr Putin placed flowers beneath a wooden cross. For most world leaders, it would be unfathomable not to have visited this spot before. It was Russia’s deadliest ever terror attack. But Mr Putin has always preferred to be filmed in a fighter jet or flanked by soldiers. The graves of children that he couldn’t save do nothing for his action man image. In fact, he had been to Beslan before, but barely noticed. Right after the siege collapsed, he flew in late at night to visit a hospital under cover of darkness. He told Beslan that all Russia was mourning with them but by sunrise he was gone. “He came far too late,” I remember hearing back then, from grieving families. “He should have stayed with us.”  But President Putin didn’t dare. Four years earlier, a previous encounter with grieving women had scarred and scared him. When the Kursk submarine sank in 2000 it took him five days to break off his holiday and by the time he met the relatives, they tore shreds off him. So Mr Putin began making the carefully-choreographed meeting a hallmark of his presidency. Only small, pre-vetted crowds. Everything under control. Last month in Beslan, just three mothers were brought to meet him. “It was an awful act of terror that took the lives of 334 people,” Mr Putin described their tragedy to them, for the sake of the state TV camera. ""Of that number, 136 were children."" The mothers are not in vision at that moment, but they surely winced at his mistake. Because 186 children were killed in Beslan.  It’s a number engrained on the brains of everyone in that town. It’s the one thing you don’t forget. But Mr Putin didn’t visit Beslan to empathise. The mothers in black were just a prop. He was using them to make a point.  Two decades ago, he reminded Russians, he had fought and won his war on terror. Now he was battling “neo-Nazis” and a hostile West in Ukraine, and he vowed he would win that war too. Distortion and lies were already in the 2004 Putin playbook. Then, officials grossly under reported the number of hostages in Beslan. I arrived in town on the first day of the siege and soon realised there were three times more hostages captive in that school than officials were admitting to.  Every local told us so. But state TV reporters, under instruction, continued to repeat the lie. People feared that troops were preparing to storm the school, so the authorities were playing down the potential casualty-count. I’ve often wondered what would happen to a government in a Western democracy after an attack that ended with many more hostages dead, than terrorists. I think it would struggle to survive the inevitable official inquiry, or the next election. Vladimir Putin didn’t have to worry about either. In 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia had failed in its duty to protect the hostages and used ‘indiscriminate force’ as the siege collapsed. The case was brought by desperate, bereaved mothers, hunting for justice. But there was no new investigation in Russia itself. No senior officials held to account. When the 3 Beslan mothers complained to Putin about that in August, at their meeting, he professed surprise and promised to look into it. He’s had 20 years. He did address one thing, though, right after the siege. In 2004, Mr Putin announced he was cancelling direct elections for governors in Russia’s regions, claiming that would help improve security. There was no connection whatsoever to the Beslan attack. When parliament gathered to vote on the move, opposition politicians picketed the building warning of a creeping dictatorship. Two decades on, there is no more opposition.  State media has been fully tamed. Democracy has been crushed. The prime lesson Mr Putin took from the siege of Beslan was one about increasing control."

The Liberal Democrats, now leading Gloucester City Council, shared a list of what it said were the former administration's 10 biggest failures. The list included the uncertainty over the future of Gloucestershire Airport and the collapse of The Club at Tuffley, which cost the council £170,000. But Tory deputy group leader, Andy Lewis, said Gloucester's food dock, The Forum, and new transport hub were some of the party's key successes while in power. As part of the Liberal Democrats' list, the party said the Tall Ships Festival had cost taxpayers £100k more than was budgeted for this year, due to lack of income from ticket sales and sponsorship, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Council leader Jeremy Hilton added: ""The Conservatives have systematically dismantled the financial foundation of the city council leaving us struggling to provide even the most basic services. “Our residents deserve better, and we shall be pressing the new Labour government to do more to support hard pressed district councils like Gloucester.”  But the Conservatives said the Lib Dems were making excuses to avoid fulfilling promises they made to voters in Gloucester. Mr Lewis said Mr Hilton had ""omitted to include many of the achievements"" of the Tories during their time running the council. ""The transformation of Gloucester city centre over the period of Conservative administration has been phenomenal with the Quays, The Docks, The Food Dock, investment in Westgate Street, The Transport Hub and The Forum,"" he added.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xl5vnlzpwo,Is US economy better or worse now than under Trump?,"BBC Verify looks at jobs, inflation, stocks and other indicators to compare the Trump and Biden economies.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It has been a recurrent theme of this US presidential campaign - has the US economy performed better under Joe Biden or Donald Trump? “By many indicators our economy is the strongest in the world,” Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has claimed. Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, says he created the ""greatest economy in the history of our country"", and the Biden-Harris administration has ruined it. We have looked at some key indicators to compare economic performance under the two presidencies. Although the impact of Covid has made comparison difficult, both presidents can count some notable economic successes despite wages struggling to keep up with price increases in recent years. First, let's look at economic growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services in the US economy.  There was a dramatic collapse in this figure during Covid as many businesses shut. Following the pandemic, the economy bounced back strongly under Trump and recovered better than many other western countries. This has continued under Mr Biden, with the US producing the strongest pandemic recovery within the G7 as measured by GDP. But over Trump's four years in office, it was not the greatest economy in US history, as he likes to claim. Between January 2017 and January 2021, average annual growth rate was 2.3%.  This period includes the slowdown and recovery of the economy as a result of the Covid pandemic. Under the Biden administration so far, this figure is 2.2% - so almost the same. There have been periods in the past when GDP growth was significantly higher than the average under both Trump and Biden, such as in the 1970s. The rate at which prices are rising has been a big issue in the campaign. Prices rose significantly during the first two years under Mr Biden - hitting a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Trump has said the US has experienced “the worst inflation we've ever had”.  But that's not true - inflation was last above 9% in 1981, and it has been much higher than that at several other points in US history. Inflation has now fallen to around 3% - but it remains higher than when Trump left office. Grocery prices, for example, increased by 13.5% over the year ending in August 2022.  This was the peak under the Biden administration, and prices have stabilised somewhat since, with the cost of groceries rising by 1.1% from July 2023 to July this year. The recent trend is comparable with many other Western countries which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues driven by Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. But some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) American Rescue Plan, which passed in 2021, was also a factor - as the injection of cash into the economy led to prices rising further. The Biden administration has repeatedly pointed to strong job growth as a major achievement. Before big job losses in 2020 due to Covid, in the first three years of Trump's presidency almost 6.7 million jobs were added, according to data for non-farm jobs (which covers about 80% of workers in the labour force). There's been an increase of almost 16 million jobs since the Biden administration took over in January 2021. Mr Biden claims this is the “fastest job growth at any point of any president in all of American history”. That’s correct - if you look at the available data since records began in 1939. But his administration has benefited from a sharp rebound in economic activity as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns. “Many of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,” says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. This spending plan passed under the Biden administration in 2021 was designed to help stimulate the economy following the pandemic. Weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they've since stabilised. Both administrations have pointed to low unemployment levels under their leadership.  Prior to the pandemic, Mr Trump delivered an unemployment rate of 3.5%. As in many parts of the world, Covid lockdown measures led to soaring levels of unemployment in the US - but the unemployment levels had dropped back down to around 7% when Trump left office. Under the Biden administration unemployment continued to fall to a low of 3.4% in January 2023 - the lowest rate in more than 50 years - but it it has since ticked up to 4.3%. In terms of wages, these did rise under Trump but at a similar rate to his predecessor Barack Obama, up until the pandemic hit. Workers’ wages increased rapidly at the start of 2020 during the Covid pandemic - but the sudden uptick in wages was linked to lower paid workers being more likely to be laid off, which raised the average wage of people who were still employed. Under Mr Biden, average weekly earnings have grown, but they have struggled to keep up with the increase in prices caused by high levels of inflation. When adjusted for inflation, average weekly wages are less than when Mr Biden came into office.  The US stock market isn't necessarily a reflection of the broader economy, but many Americans have investments, so its performance holds some importance. The Dow Jones Index is a measure of the performance of 30 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. It reached record highs during Trump’s presidency, but crashed as markets reacted to the pandemic, wiping out all the gains made under Trump.  However, the financial markets recovered to above pre-pandemic levels by the time Trump left office in January 2021. They have continued to grow under Mr Biden, and although there have been recent wobbles, they have reached record levels under his administration as well. Graphics by Tommy Lumby.

Lucy Connolly, 41, a childminder whose husband serves on West Northamptonshire Council, called for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire and for mass deportations. Her expletive-ridden post appeared on the X platform on the day three girls were killed in Southport. Judge Adrienne Lucking KC warned Connolly she faced a jail sentence. Connolly posted a call for hotels housing migrants to be set on fire and for ""mass deportation now"". ""If that makes me racist, so be it,"" she added. Connolly, of Parkfield Avenue in Northampton, appeared by video link from HMP Peterborough wearing a flower-patterned short-sleeved dress for the hearing at Northampton Crown Court. Also in the courts earlier were: After admitting publishing threatening or abusive material intending to stir up racial hatred, the judge announced that Lucy Connolly's sentencing would be transferred to Birmingham to avoid any potential local bias given her husband's political role. Judge Lucking said: ""Sentencing will entirely be a matter for the judge on the next occasion but it's likely to be a substantial custodial sentence. ""In the meantime, you are remanded in custody."" Her husband, Raymond Connolly, watched the hearing from the public gallery. Outside court, Mr Connolly told reporters the last few months had been ""quite traumatic for Lucy and the children"". He added that his wife ""knows she overstepped the mark and there's consequences for it, so hopefully she will be able to learn from it and move on with her life"". He said she had regretted the post ""a couple of hours after she put the link up"". He revealed that he had received messages of support from some residents urging him not to resign as a councillor, while others had contacted him to say he should quit. ""I'll leave it to the next elections and let them decide,"" he said. Frank Ferguson, head of the Crown Prosecution Service special crime and counter terrorism unit, said: “During police interview, Lucy Connolly stated she had strong views on immigration, told officers she did not like immigrants and claimed that children were not safe from them. ""It is not an offence to have strong or differing political views, but it is an offence to incite racial hatred – and that is what Connolly has admitted doing."" She will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on 17 October. Follow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm7llzk722o,Cemetery expansion 'reasonable' - says report,The council wants to expand the cemetery onto land used by Bristol's last working Farm.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Decisions surrounding the controversial expansion of South Bristol Cemetery and Crematorium were ""compliant"" and ""reasonable"", a city council report has found. The report was ordered by the new leader of the council, Green Party councillor Tony Dyer, who said it had ""laid the path"" to reaching a conclusion on the matter. The council wants to expand the cemetery due to a shortage of burial spaces.  But campaigners oppose the £3m expansion of the crematorium, which would go onto land currently used by Bristol's last working Farm - Yew Tree Farm.  Catherine Withers, who runs the farm, has said the Green Party, ""would never get elected again"" if the expansion goes ahead.   The report - written by the council's own legal team - focussed on four decision making areas.  These included the decision by the council's planning committee to approve the expansion plans at a meeting last year, as well an application by a third party to remove part of a hedgerow on the farm. The report concluded that ""all executive and regulatory decisions associated with the project were taken appropriately, legally and with relevant information considered"". However, the future of the expansion remains unclear. At the meeting last November, campaigners against the crematorium's expansion heckled councillors who had voted in favour of it.  It led to a political row between the Labour group and the Green Party. The scenes marked the dividing lines on the issue, with Green Party councillors supporting the continued use of the land by Yew Tree Farm for cattle grazing, however they were outvoted by those sympathetic to the need for more burial space in the city.  The political situation has since changed in Bristol, with the Green Party now the largest group on Bristol City Council, following elections last May.  Responding to the report, Mr Dyer said it ""provides a welcome opportunity to take a breath and fully consider the various issues and factors relating to what is a complex topic"". ""With the clarity this review provides on how we’ve arrived at the situation we face, the path is laid down to support coming to an appropriate conclusion,"" he added, without outlining what his preferred conclusion is.  Meanwhile, campaigners continue to oppose any development on Yew Tree Farm, with a crowd funder launched recently to mount a legal challenge against the crematorium expansion.  The issue will return to the council's Public Health Policy Committee in October. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgky2v681z4o,‘I want to see her challenged’ - swing voters unconvinced by Harris interview,Three undecided voters explain why the Democrat's first interview did not persuade them to back her - yet.,31 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris’s first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential candidate was an opportunity to introduce herself - and her campaign’s message - to Americans who say they do not yet know her or for what she stands. The vice-president defended her record in the White House and addressed questions about a series of policy shifts since she first ran for the top job in 2019 during the CNN interview on Thursday. Ms Harris and her running mate - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who joined her for the interview - have enjoyed a surge of enthusiasm from Democrats in recent weeks,  but the campaign knows they must win over undecided voters to win November’s election. Young men are a significant proportion of those persuadable voters, and a group that Republican Donald Trump has been aggressively targeting with a slew of recent media appearances on podcasts that boast audiences that are largely young and male. Given the battle for their vote, what did three of them make of Ms Harris’s first sit-down interview? This software engineer backed Democrats in the last two elections but remains undecided in 2024. Harris can speak coherently, which I think is just an upgrade from the prior two candidates, both Trump and Biden. I think she's relatively eloquent in the way that she talks. But in terms of policy, this was the first time I think I’ve actually heard some elements of substantive policy from her.  The interview didn't do a whole lot to assuage my concerns - what she’d actually want to do and whether she'd be able to effectively implement it. You’ve been VP for a few years, why haven't you attempted these things before? The interview didn’t change my mind on how to vote. To be honest, I want to see her challenged in a press conference or obviously the debate that's coming up. I think I need to see her in that kind of a setting, without a teleprompter or rehearsed answers. I think the interview was a little too coddled. I want to see her put under some pressure. I don't think she's done too well in the past as the VP in those situations. Walz came across as very personable. I think he helps kind of instill a sense of this good old American, kind of down-to-earth feeling that I think was missing from her in particular. I do like his addition to the ticket. A teacher who voted for the Green Party in 2020, Jeremy felt Harris’s message lacked conviction. I feel they've been very vague. I understand why, to a degree, from their perspective that it's more ‘Let's make this about Donald Trump,’ rather than about policy. But that only gets you so far.  I was frustrated with her for saying the phrase ‘My values have not changed, but my policies have.’ If you were consistent on your values, if you want clean energy, then you would still be in favour of the ban on fracking. When they talked about the Israel and Gaza she said we're going to maintain the Biden administration policy. It's a policy that, at least to me, has failed both Jews and Palestinians. People on both sides seem to be no closer to a deal and people on both sides continue to suffer. So saying we're going to maintain a policy that has gotten nowhere in almost a year feels almost like she's rather just trying to not lose voters rather than say I'm going to work towards a solution. I didn’t hear enough to persuade me yet. Because it feels like, on one hand, she's saying, we'll be different to Biden, but on the other hand, it's also like it's just going to be the same with a new face. A student who did not vote last time, he feels lost since his favourite candidate, Robert Kennedy Jr, endorsed Trump. I wasn't particularly impressed, to be honest. I don't think the interview revealed much. I also understand that’s sort of politics, and that's going to be true of any given campaign, that the more specific they get, the easier it is to campaign against them. I appreciated when Harris specifically was talking about her planned measures for economic reform and this opportunity economy she was talking about. But I don’t think it was particularly compelling or the questions were particularly challenging. I'm not sure if anything in it would convince me to vote for the Harris-Walz campaign. One of the big reasons people were excited for Harris taking over the ticket - after Biden was so bad in live, unscripted environments - was that she was young and she might infuse more energy into the Democratic campaign. But because of the lack of live interviews and answering questions so far I still have concerns about their competency.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlv7jdnq8o,Right-wing US influencers say they were victims of alleged Russian plot,"Several commentators said that, if the allegations proved true, they were ""deceived"" by the Russian government front.",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Conservative US influencers say if the allegations are proven, they were deceived by Russian media executives following the release of an indictment charging Moscow with interfering in the 2024 US election.  The indictment accuses state broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today, of paying a Tennessee firm $10m (£7.6m) to ""create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging"". US media outlets identified the firm as Tenet Media, which describes itself as ""network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues"". Tenet Media, which was not directly named in the indictment, was founded in 2022 by conservative Canadian YouTuber Lauren Chen and her husband Liam Donovan. Tenet has not commented publicly on the allegations and did not respond to a request for comment. The network employs several well-known right-wing US influencers - such as Tim Pool, David Rubin and Benny Johnson - who say they are ""victims"" of the alleged plot if it is proven. US officials characterised the US and Canada-based influencers that worked for Tenet as ""unwitting"" figures in the Russian scheme, which allegedly paid some commentators hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to make videos for the platform. The indictment says that videos - which often promoted right-wing narratives on issues such as immigration, gender and the economy - were secretly ""edited, posted, and directed"" by two RT employees.  “While the views expressed in the videos are not uniform, the subject matter and content of the videos are often consistent with the Government of Russia’s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine,” the indictment said. Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva were identified in the indictment as the RT staffers. The justice department has charged them with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  In a response to a request for comment on the indictment, RT's press team said: ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"".  The indictment says that Mr Kalashnikov ""monitored"" the company's ""funding, hiring and contract negotiations"" with some of the commentators and Ms Afanasyeva was involved in the firm's editorial efforts.  It is said that the company's founders did find the ease they had in acquiring funding to be suspicious.  The platform's two founders ""admitted to each other in their private communications that their 'investors' were, in truth and in fact, the 'Russians'"", the indictment says.  Several of the influencers said on social media that, if the allegations are true, they should be considered ""victims"" of the plot. They also insisted that they maintained full editorial control over their content.  Mr Pool, whose The Culture War Podcast was licensed by Tenet Media, told his 2.1 million followers on X/Twitter that if ""these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims. I cannot speak for anyone else at the company as to what they do or to what they are instructed"". Mr Johnson, who has 2.7 million followers on X, said on Wednesday that he was “disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme”. He said that his company's lawyers had ""negotiated a standard, arms length deal"" after they were approached by the media startup. He said that agreement was later terminated. Mr Rubin, who boasts 1.5 million followers on X, said his show on Tenet ended months ago, and that he had not been contacted by the justice department. ""I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme,"" he wrote concerning the allegations. ""I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity."" The indictment says that the media company posted about 2,000 videos that received more than 16 million views on YouTube since the plot got underway.  “The company never disclosed to the influencers or to their millions of followers its ties to RT and the Russian government,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Wednesday. Two of Tenet Media's other contributors said on a livestream that they were never told what to say in their content. “How am I unwittingly duped into saying someone else’s words when I wrote every one of them?” Matt Christiansen, a less prominent commentator, said.  The court document alleges that the commentators exacted a huge payout in negotiations, with three of the biggest stars getting paid $8.7m. According to the indictment, the Russian scheme directed a founder of the media company to recruit two conservative influencers by offering them $2m a year.  The indictment says that one of the commentators responded that ""it would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested"", and the other said ""it would take 100k per weekly episode to make it worth his while"". The first influencer allegedly eventually agreed to make four videos per month for $400,000, and the other, according to the indictment, allegedly agreed to be paid $100,000 per video.  To close the negotiations, the Russians allegedly fabricated a Hungarian businessman named ""Eduard Grigoriann"" as a key investor. They went so far as to create a fake CV for the false identity, according to the court documents, and held phone calls with an agent posing as him.  The indictment cites multiple instances in which the platform's employees had their own suspicions about the arrangement they found themselves in.  Ms Afanasyeva is said to have shared a video to be posted made by a well-known political commentator visiting a grocery store in Russia. Media outlets have identified this alleged commentator as Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News star, who visited Russia to interview President Vladimir Putin.  He uses Russia's store prices to opine on US inflation and cost-of-living issues. There is no suggestion he was aware of the alleged plot. According to the indictment, a producer privately messaged one of the company's founders complaining that ""they want me to post this"" but added that ""it just feels like overt shilling"". The producer is said to have ultimately put the video out at the founder's direction. At another point, Ms Afanasyeva allegedly directed one of the founders to get ""one of our creators"" to ""record something about (the) Moscow terror attack"" in an effort to link it to Ukraine and the United States, despite the Islamic State claiming responsibility. The indictment suggests that the commentators ultimately fulfilled her requests, but Ms Afanasyeva is said to have grown annoyed multiple times when she did not think they were promoting the company's videos enough.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz072yl775zo,Just two candidates approved to challenge Tunisia president,Rights groups say there is an effort to restrict the number of candidates ahead of October's vote.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Tunisia's electoral commission has approved just three candidates to run in next month's presidential election ignoring a court ruling to reinstate three others. Among those approved are President Kais Saied and Ayachi Zammel, whose campaign team had earlier said had been arrested on Monday. The president faces accusations of trying to restrict the number of those allowed to run against him. Since he won his first term in 2019 Mr Saied has suspended parliament and concentrated power in his hands. Last week, the country's highest court said three candidates who had been barred from running by the electoral commission should be allowed to participate.  Farouk Bouasker, the head of the commission, had said he would look at the court's ruling before making a decision. In a statement quoted by the AFP news agency, the commission said that the court had not officially communicated its ruling within the deadline. Ignoring the court's ruling is likely to cast further doubt on the credibility of the vote, BBC Middle East editor Sebastian Usher reports. For many Tunisians, all this is yet another sign of how far they feel their country has moved away from the democratic path it embarked upon after the Arab Spring in 2011, he adds. New York-based rights group Human Rights Watch said in August that the authorities had excluded eight other prospective candidates for the 6 October election through prosecution and imprisonment. Mr Zammel's campaign team, which said he was accused of falsifying details of those who backed him, dismissed the allegation as ""absurd"", the Reuters news agency reports. In 2021, after sacking the prime minister and suspending parliament, President Saied pushed through a new constitution cementing his one-man rule. The new constitution replaced one drafted soon after the Arab Spring, which saw Tunisia overthrow late dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. It gave the head of state full executive control and supreme command of the army. Mr Saied has justified his actions by saying he needed new powers to break a cycle of political paralysis and economic decay. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89w28w13zxo,Trump ordered to stop using Isaac Hayes' music,"A judge says Trump must stop playing Hold On I'm Coming, while a permanent injunction is considered.",4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A US judge has ordered Donald Trump's campaign to stop using the song Hold On, I’m Coming at his rallies, in response to a lawsuit from the family of the song's co-writer, Isaac Hayes. The Republican presidential nominee regularly plays the song before and after his speeches, including at the Republican National Convention in July. However, Hayes' family have sued Mr Trump's campaign, saying that it repeatedly ignored requests to stop using the song, made famous by soul duo Sam and Dave in 1966. The temporary ruling, by Judge Thomas Thrash in Georgia, means the campaign is banned from playing it again until the court case is settled. However, the judge did not grant a request to order Mr Trump’s campaign to take down recordings of past events in which it had used the song. Hayes' son, Isaac Hayes III, welcomed the ruling, saying that his father, who died in 2008, would not have endorsed the former President. ""We have to take a stand that we want to separate ourselves from someone with Donald Trump's character,"" he said outside the Richard B Russell Federal courthouse in Atlanta, Georgia. ""This is not a political issue, this is a character issue."" Ronald Coleman, a lawyer for Mr Trump, said that the campaign had already agreed to ""cease further use"" of Hold On, I'm Coming (Mr Trump has returned to using the Village People's YMCA since the lawsuit was filed last month). ""We’re very gratified that the court recognised the First Amendment issues at stake and didn’t order a takedown of existing videos,"" Mr Coleman added. He also suggested the case could be settled before coming to trial. ""Before we left court, we spoke to the Hayes' attorneys and to Mr Hayes III, about trying to work something out. We want this to be as a cooperative process as possible going forward,"" he told reporters. Hayes composed the song in 1966 with Dave Porter, when he was a staff writer at Stax Records. He went on to become a Grammy and Oscar-winner in his own right, with hits like Shaft and Walk On By. The star's estate claims that the Mr Trump's campaign used the song on 134 separate occasions after they first asked him to desist.  They are demanding $3m (£2.4m) in licensing fees for the repeated use of the song between 2022 and 2024. Mr Trump’s lawyers argued that the Hayes estate was not the license holder for the song, and that it had permission to use it, a statement Hayes family lawyers said was “erroneous”. Dozens of other artists have objected to the use of their songs at Republican rallies, as the US Presidential election draws closer. Abba, Foo Fighters, the White Stripes singer Jack White, Celine Dion and Johnny Marr have all raised objections in the last month alone. However, musicians have only had limited success in stopping politicians from using their music, and legal proceedings often drag on for years. A case from Guyanese-British singer Eddy Grant over Mr Trump's use of his song Electric Avenue is due to be heard in a Manhattan court this Friday, four years after the star's initial complaint. The star sued Mr Trump over a 2020 campaign video that was soundtracked by a 40-second clip of his song.  The video was viewed 13.7 million times before Twitter took it down, and Grant says this was an unauthorised use for which Mr Trump owes him $300,000 (£229,000) in damages. As with the Hayes' case, lawyers for Mr Trump argue that the singer does not hold the copyright for his own song."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4ye15le8xo,Baseless claim about Harris crash spread by mysterious website,The false story has been viewed millions of times online - we break down how you can know it was fake.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A story posted on a mysterious website has been widely circulated on social media after it made a baseless claim that Kamala Harris - the Democratic presidential nominee - was involved in an alleged hit-and-run incident. It claims, without providing evidence, that a 13-year-old girl was left paralysed by the crash, which it says took place in San Francisco in 2011. The story, which was published on 2 September by a website purporting to be a media organisation called KBSF-San Francisco News, has been widely shared online. Some online posts by right-leaning users citing the story have been viewed millions of times. BBC Verify has found numerous false details indicating it is fake and the website has now been taken down. The online article - accompanied by a five-minute video - contains an interview with a woman who it identifies as 26-year-old Alicia Brown and who it claims is paralysed. There is no evidence to confirm her identity or whether she is paralysed (she is filmed sitting down and from the waist up in an undisclosed location). The article refers to her as both Alisha and Alicia, without explanation. In the video, she claims she was hit by a car while crossing the road in June 2011 with her mother in San Francisco and later claims, again without providing any evidence, that the person who hit her was Kamala Harris. A narrator in the video then say this woman has undergone 11 surgeries and two X-rays are shown.  No evidence of the incident occurring nor the involvement of Ms Harris are provided. BBC Verify ran a search for the website’s registration details, which revealed the domain was set up within the last few weeks - on 20 August 2024. There is also no public record of a KBSF news outlet in San Francisco. The website has now been taken offline and is no longer accessible. The top image in the story, which also features in the video, shows a close up of a smashed car windscreen with what looks like a police officer and a number of fire crew standing by the side of the road next to it. BBC Verify downloaded the image and searched for previous versions of it online - using a reverse image search tool - and found that it was originally posted in a news story about a crash in Mangilao, Guam, in 2018. Next, we examined the X-rays shown in the video. Using reverse image search again, it is clear that these images have been lifted from medical research articles posted in 2010 and 2017. According to the articles, the first X-ray belongs to a 58-year-old patient admitted to a hospital in China.  The second X-ray belongs to a 12-year-old girl admitted to the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. On the video interview itself, we approached several experts to see whether it had been generated by AI. Professor Hany Farid, an expert in digitally manipulated images, analysed the video and found no evidence of digital manipulation or AI-generation in either the audio or visuals. “I think it is most likely that this is an old-fashioned (and not particularly well executed) cheap fake that is simply staged,” he said. Prof Farid explained that unlike “deepfakes” which are typically created or edited by using artificial intelligence tools, a “cheap fake” can be created by using lower-tech software that is cheaper and more accessible. A cheap fake, he said, encompasses everything from slowing down an audio to make someone sound drunk to cropping an image. “It is a good reminder that we don't need a lot of technology to perpetrate lies,” Prof Farid added. We looked for any press reports from 2011 about a hit and run incident in San Francisco allegedly involving Ms Harris - who was then Attorney General of California - but could find none. We have also contacted the San Francisco police department and the Harris campaign. The story and the website it originally appeared on share striking similarities with a network of fake news websites that masquerade as US local news outlets, which BBC Verify has previously extensively reported on. John Mark Dougan, a former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind the network. Approached by BBC Verify to comment on the hit-and-run story, Mr Dougan denied any involvement, saying: “Do I ever admit to anything? Of course it’s not one of mine.” The websites mix dozens of genuine news stories taken from real news outlets with what is essentially the real meat of the operation - totally fabricated stories that often include misinformation about Ukraine or target US audiences. The websites are often set up shortly before the fake stories appear on them, and then go offline after they serve their purpose. These fabricated stories often include videos featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Examples of the fake stories include a rare Bugatti car purchased by Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska, an expensive UK mansion purchased by President Zelensky, and a secret wiretapping operation at Donald Tump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.  What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39k379grzlo,Kamala Harris criticises Trump over Arlington Cemetery dispute,"Harris says the cemetery is ""not a place for politics"" in her first remarks on the incident.",2 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has criticised former president Donald Trump over a recent controversy involving his campaign at Arlington National Cemetery, saying the military burial site is “not a place for politics”. Earlier in the week, the US Army said a Trump staffer “abruptly pushed aside” an Arlington employee as they tried to warn his team about rules against filming in the cemetery. The event attended by Trump on Monday was to honour 13 US military service members who were killed during the chaotic American withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago. The Trump campaign has disputed the cemetery's version of events, and was invited by the families of the fallen soldiers.  Ms Harris wrote that Trump “disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt”. Saturday’s social media post marked the first time Ms Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, commented on the controversy. She said she had visited the cemetery in Virginia several times during her tenure as vice-president, and she would never use the site for political gain. “If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honoured, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,” Ms Harris said. “And it is my belief that someone who cannot meet this simple, sacred duty should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.” At a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump hit back at those who had criticised him over the incident. He said he had been asked to pose for a photo at the site after the memorial by family members of the soldiers who had died. “I go there, they ask me to have a picture and they say I was campaigning,” Trump said. “The one thing I get plenty of is publicity. I don't need that. I don't need the publicity.” On Sunday, the Trump campaign released a statement from the Gold Star military families that invited him to the event, saying the former president was there to honour the sacrifice of their relatives who were killed.  They also took aim at Ms Harris in the statement, saying she has ""disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy"". Meanwhile, Trump's running mate JD Vance used the controversy to attack the Biden administration over its handling of the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying that Ms Harris ""can go to hell"".  ""Three years ago, 13 brave, innocent Americans died, and they died because Kamala Harris refused to do her job,"" Mr Vance said in response to questions from BBC's US partner, CBS News.  NPR reported earlier that two members of Trump’s campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the cemetery worker aside when she tried to intervene.  Federal law prevents use of the cemetery for political campaigning and the US Army said participants were warned of the rules in advance. A US Army spokesperson said that “the incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked.” The Trump campaign has denied that a physical altercation took place at the cemetery, adding “we are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made”. House Democrats have since asked the US Army for a report into the incident, asking for a “full account” of what happened."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7rj432835o,Scrutiny over claims RFK Jr cut off dead whale's head,Activists say the alleged incident decades ago may have broken conservation laws.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Robert F Kennedy Jr faces calls from environmentalists for an investigation over a historic claim that he once cut the head off a dead beached whale with a chainsaw to take it home on the roof of his vehicle. A group that supports Kamala Harris for president says Mr Kennedy's alleged removal and transportation of the skull of the whale may have broken the law. Mr Kennedy, 70, has not commented on the incident, detailed by his daughter in an interview 12 years ago.  The call for an investigation comes days after he suspended his independent presidential campaign, which was marked by strange twists including his confession that he once dumped the body of a dead bear in New York's Central Park. Mr Kennedy has now endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, and has been offered a place on the Republican candidate's transition team if he is elected. The incident with the whale's head, which dates to around 1994, was recounted by Kathleen ""Kick"" Kennedy in a 2012 interview with Town & Country magazine.  Mr Kennedy, who is said to enjoy studying animal skulls and skeletons, reportedly heard that the dead animal had washed up in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where the family was staying. He went to the beach to cut off the head with a chainsaw, and then proceeded to tie it to the roof of the family minivan with bungee cords. The family then drove back to their home in New York, Ms Kennedy said. ""Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,"" Ms Kennedy told the magazine.  ""We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us."" The call for an investigation was made by the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, which has publicly endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for president. The group wrote a letter to set out their case to marine protection officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The letter, quoted by US media, said Mr Kennedy may have broken multiple federal laws by collecting wildlife body parts and transporting them across state lines. “Vital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists,"" the group's political director Brett Hartl wrote. ""This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study,” Mr Hartl added. Noaa confirmed to the BBC that it received the letter and was compiling a response. Mr Kennedy has not confirmed receipt of the letter. The BBC has approached his campaign for comment.  At one point earlier this year, Mr Kennedy averaged about 15% in presidential preference polls as an independent candidate. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions, environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. But his numbers dwindled, and he announced last week he was suspending his campaign. Although he initially competed to win the Democratic nomination, he ended up criticising his former party and offering his endorsement to Donald Trump. The move dismayed his relatives, who are the most famous family in Democratic politics. Mr Kennedy's campaign attracted a range of bizarre and scandalous headlines. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. “I have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,” he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of “garbage” but conceded that he had a “very, very rambunctious youth” and that he was “not a church boy”. Earlier this month, Mr Kennedy was filmed talking to actress Roseanne Barr, recounting the 2014 incident with the dead bear cub. He said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving in a rural area, and he put it in his van with the initial intention of harvesting its meat. But ultimately he thought it would be ""amusing"" to leave the carcass in New York's Central Park, to make it appear that an errant cyclist had killed the animal. The bear was found the following day.  Responding to a BBC request for comment, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation said charges could not be brought for incidents more than a year old."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy547v72nd4o,Trump to vote against Florida abortion measure after backlash,"The former president appeared open to voting to pass a referendum that would expand abortion rights, but faced pressure from conservatives.",31 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has said he will vote against a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would protect abortion rights after facing backlash from conservative supporters.   The former president's announcement came one day after an NBC News interview in which he appeared to support the measure - a statement that caused anti-abortion activists to openly criticise him. On Friday, Trump told Fox News that he still thinks Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks is too strict. However he said would still vote ""no"" on a measure that would amend the state's constitution to protect abortion rights. ""You need more time than six weeks,"" Trump said. ""I’ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it."" He then falsely alleged that Democrats in the US supported allowing abortions at any point during a pregnancy, which he used as his explanation for deciding to vote against the ballot measure in Florida as a voter in the state.  Abortion laws vary widely in states across the US, but procedures after 21 weeks of pregnancy are rare and are often related to foetal anomalies or threats to the mother's life, according to the non-profit health organisation KFF.  The Republican presidential nominee's decision to vote against the Florida abortion measure comes just one day after he was asked by NBC News how he would vote.  “I think the six week is too short,” Trump said in the interview on Thursday. “It has to be more time. I told them that I want more weeks.” “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” he said when pressed. His Democratic opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris, quickly responded to Trump's announcement that he would support continuing Florida's abortion ban as indicative of him continuing his anti-abortion stance. “Donald Trump just made his position on abortion very clear: He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant,"" she said in a statement.   Thursday's comments - in which Trump appeared to be open to voting in favour of the constitutional amendment - were heavily criticised by leaders in the anti-abortion movement, which plays a critical role in shaping conservative politics in the US. “If Donald Trump loses, today is the day he lost,” conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “The committed pro-life community could turn a blind eye, in part, to national abortion issues. But for Trump to weigh in on Florida as he did will be a bridge too far for too many.” Albert Mohler Jr, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote on X that Trump's comments on reproductive rights, including on the six-week ban, ""seem almost calculated to alienate prolife voters"". “Pro-life Christian voters are going to have to think clearly, honestly, and soberly about our challenge in this election - starting at the top of the ticket,"" he said. After the Thursday NBC interview, the Trump campaign and his running mate JD Vance made public statements emphasising that the former president had not yet made up his mind on the ballot initiative.  Mr Vance said the former president will ""make his own announcement on how he's going to vote"" on the Florida measure that will be based on ""his own judgement"". Trump has criticised Florida's six-week abortion ban before.  Last September he said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made a ""terrible mistake"" signing the ban into law. Mr DeSantis was challenging the former president in the Republican primary at the time. Responding to Trump's comments, the Harris campaign made clear that they would make abortion rights central to their election effort. Kevin Munoz, a campaign spokesperson, told reporters that they would continue to frame it around the concept of freedom, a campaign theme: “Kamala Harris is going to fight for your rights. Donald Trump will take them away.” In 2022, the US Supreme Court struck down the right to abortion nationwide, leaving the decision to states. As a result, Florida banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. The proposed constitutional amendment sought by reproductive rights advocates in Florida does not specify a number of weeks, but would protect abortion access in the state until the point of foetal viability, which is about 23-25 weeks of pregnancy. As it stands, the state has a near-total ban on abortion, as many women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks. Opinion polling indicates that a majority of Americans support abortion access.  A July poll from the University of North Florida suggested that 69% of likely voters supported the Florida ballot measure, and 23% opposed it. The political backlash after the Supreme Court brought an end to Roe v Wade has presented Trump with a political conundrum he has yet to fully solve. Trump rose to power with the help of the religious right, which broadly supports restrictions on the procedure. In his first run for president, he pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn the constitutional right to abortion in the US.  He kept the promise by appointing three conservative jurists who ultimately voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Trump has taken the position in his 2024 campaign that abortion policy should be left to individual states, which has put him at odds with many conservatives who seek to restrict the procedure nationwide. Nevertheless, rank-and-file party members fell in line behind the former president at the Republican National Convention in July. Further complicating Trump's standing is his new proposal to make the government or insurance companies pay for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).  Some anti-abortion and religious groups object to IVF due to its use of embryos. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g7n1ypwlo,Standoff as police close in on 'Son of God' pastor,Apollo Quiboloy is wanted by Manila and the FBI for child sex trafficking and other crimes.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A standoff has erupted in the Philippines as thousands of police officers descended on a sprawling religious compound in search of an influential pastor who has been accused of child sex trafficking amongst other crimes.  Police say they will not leave until they have found Apollo Quiboloy, who calls himself the ""appointed Son of God"".  He is believed to be hiding inside his 30 hectare (75 acres) complex, which houses some 40 buildings, including a cathedral, a school and even a hangar.  Authorities have been on the hunt for Mr Quiboloy for months. He had earlier said he would ""not be caught alive"". Police raided the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) compound late on Saturday, with reports saying they later used tear gas against Mr Quiboloy's followers who had become ""unruly and violent"", Davao police spokesperson Major Catherina dela Rey told news outlet Rappler.  Hundreds of Mr Quiboloy's followers have blocked parts of a major highway in an attempt to disrupt traffic to the compound.  They maintain his innocence, saying allegations against him are fabricated.  One supporter of the group died from a heart attack during the police raid. Police believe Mr Quiboloy is hiding in an underground bunker based on equipment that is believed to be able to detect people behind walls based on their heartbeat, said Maj dela Rey.  Mr Quiboloy's KOJC claims to have seven million followers and he has grown his ministry through television, radio and social media. He is also politically influential and serves as spiritual adviser to former President Rodrigo Duterte, whose family rules Davao city politics. Since Mr Duterte stepped down in 2022, authorities have been pursuing charges against Mr Quiboloy. He is accused of trafficking his followers to the US to solicit donations for bogus charities. He also allegedly required his female followers, some underage, to have sex with him as a religious duty. He has said that the ""devil"" was behind his legal woes. He has also said that he does not want the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to ""meddle"" in his case. Mr Quiboloy said in April that he was ""preserving"" himself by hiding from authorities. ""I am not hiding from the charges because I am guilty. That's not true. I am just protecting myself,"" he said.  Mr Quiboloy is the leader of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, a Christian sect that claims to have seven million members.  He claims to have heard God whisper to him “I will use you” while attending an event by American pastor Billy Graham in South Korea in 1973. This led him to set up the KOJC in the Philippines' Davao in 1985. Mr Quiboloy preaches from a glass table that is set against giant photographs of his lush hilltop estate called the “Garden of Eden Restored”. When he is not in Davao, he has been seen travelling on his private jet. His rise to national prominence has mirrored that of Mr Duterte. Both started in Davao, where the former president served as mayor. When Mr Duterte was elected president in 2016, Mr Quiboloy's profile rose even higher. But that started to diminish when Mr Duterte left office in 2022.  Outside of his alliance with Mr Duterte, Mr Quiboloy has also gained considerable clout by endorsing politicians during elections. Mr Quiboloy was a supporter of one of Duterte's predecessors, Gloria Arroyo. When he endorsed Arroyo's choice of successor in the 2010 elections, Mr Quiboloy claimed to have seen the candidate's name in a vision that included then US President Barack Obama. In the Philippines, leaders of religious organisations and sects become politically powerful when they direct their followers to vote as a bloc, analysts say. Electoral contests can get so cutthroat that some candidates believe the endorsement of leaders like Mr Quiboloy could make or break their campaign. ""Politics in the Philippines is very much a moral exercise. Therefore, voters look to their religious leaders for guidance,"" political scientist Cleve Arguelles told BBC News. In 2021, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Mr Quiboloy with sex trafficking of children, fraud and coercion and bulk cash smuggling. The FBI said he trafficked girls and women from the Philippines to the US, where they are forced to solicit money for a bogus charity. He also required his female personal assistants, who are called “pastorals”, to have sex with him, the FBI said. In January 2022, the FBI released a wanted poster seeking information on Mr Quiboloy's whereabouts. Last March, the Philippines DOJ filed human trafficking and sexual harassment charges against Mr Quiboloy, for allegedly abusing a teenage woman in 2011. Courts in both the US and Philippine have issued warrants for his arrest. Mr Quiboloy has denied the charges against him and has accused US authorities of pre-judging his case."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy78g4vg3po,Fact-checking Kamala Harris’s first campaign interview,"BBC Verify looks into claims the vice-president made on CNN about fracking, child poverty and green jobs.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has given her first interview since entering the race - a joint conversation alongside running mate Tim Walz. BBC Verify has looked into claims she made in the CNN interview about fracking, the Biden administration’s record on child tax poverty and investment in clean-energy jobs. CLAIM: In Thursday’s interview, Ms Harris said she would not ban fracking and maintained that she has “not changed that position”. VERDICT: This needs context and could be misleading as Ms Harris has changed her public position on fracking. In 2019, she said she was “in favour of banning fracking.” The following year, in the 2020 vice presidential debate when she was on the Biden ticket, Ms Harris said “Joe Biden will not end fracking” and: “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” During the CNN interview on Thursday she was pressed on her 2019 statement, and Ms Harris responded: “I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice-president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” In the debate, Ms Harris was referring to President Joe Biden’s policy plans. She did not state whether her own views at the time differed from this position. CLAIM: “When we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit, so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%.” VERDICT: This is somewhat of an exaggeration and needs context. Child poverty rates did fall, but not by “over 50%” and they rose again the year after, so the impact was only temporary. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is one measure of poverty in the US and it does show that the child poverty rate fell 46% between 2020 and 2021. However, after the Covid-era boost to child tax credit ended, the record low child poverty rate of 5.2% in 2021 rose to 12.4% the following year, according to 2022 Census Bureau data. Americans earning less than $200,000 annually (or $400,000 for joint claimants) can, under the current child tax credit scheme, get $2,000 per year for each of their children under the age of 17. This amount was increased by President Biden during the Covid pandemic up to a maximum of $3,600 but it reverted back to $2,000 at the end of 2021. Kamala Harris has said that as president she would restore the child tax credit enhancement and provide $6,000 per child to families for the first year of a baby’s life. CLAIM: “What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean-energy jobs.” VERDICT: It is true that a large number of clean energy jobs have been created under the Biden administration, but the exact number is uncertain. Kamala Harris is referring to the jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act - a law signed by Joe Biden in August 2022 that introduced major investments in clean energy and climate-related projects. The claim of “over 300,000 new clean-energy jobs” comes from a recent report by Climate Power, a climate communications organisation. It reported that since August 2022 companies have “announced and advanced 646 new clean energy projects totalling 334,565 new jobs”. However, not all of these new job roles have necessarily begun, and it is also hard to attribute the whole increase in climate-related employment to the Inflation Reduction Act at a time when clean energy is growing across the world. Other groups give different numbers. E2, an economics and environment group, estimates around 109,000 clean-energy jobs have been created or announced since the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the US Department of Energy, in 2023 clean-energy employment grew at a rate twice as large as the US economy overall and the rest of the energy sector."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgwnn11x18o,Arlington Cemetery worker 'pushed aside' by Trump aides - Army,"The campaign is disputing reports of the incident, which stemmed from federal rules on filming military burial sites.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"An Arlington National Cemetery employee was ""abruptly pushed aside"" by a member of Donald Trump's campaign staff while trying to warn them about filming at the burial site for military members, the US Army said. The official was attempting to ensure Trump and campaign staff participating in a wreath-laying ceremony were adhering to rules, ""which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds"". ""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" a US Army spokesman said in a statement on Thursday.  The Trump campaign denied the allegations and said it received permission from families of fallen service members to film. Federal law prevents use of the cemetery for political campaigning and the US Army said participants were warned of the rules in advance. Though the incident was reported to the police, the employee decided not to pursue charges, according to the statement. The Army said it considered the matter closed.  Trump was at the memorial to honour the 13 US military service members who were killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago Monday.  The event took place in what’s known as Section 60 where troops killed fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried Trump alleged at a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday that he had been asked to pose for a photo at the site after the memorial by family members of the soldiers who had died.  He said that he then read later that night ""that I was using the site to politic"". ""I go there, they ask me to have a picture and they say I was campaigning,"" he said. ""The one thing I get plenty of is publicity. I don't need that. I don't need the publicity."" NPR reported earlier that two members of Trump’s campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the worker aside when she tried to prevent filming or photographing. Defence officials told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that some Trump campaign staff were unprofessional and both verbally and physically aggressive towards the cemetery official.  Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, disputed that there was a physical altercation and said the campaign was prepared to release video to confirm its account. The campaign did share some footage of the visit on social media on Tuesday, but the alleged altercation was not included.  In his statement, Mr Cheung said: ""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony."" The tone of that statement, and further attacks by Trump’s running mate JD Vance criticising coverage of the episode, have added further fuel to the row. Some veterans’ groups have accused Trump of using the graves of fallen soldiers as a campaign stunt at America’s most hallowed ground to its war dead.  While the families of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan accompanied Trump at the ceremony and said they approved of the photos, the rules do not allow families to give permission for filming in the cemetery. Trump has repeatedly campaigned on his claim that the Biden-Harris administration lost control in Afghanistan, blaming them for the deaths of the soldiers and their families' heartache. He returned to this allegation at his Michigan rally on Thursday: ""Joe Biden killed their children by incompetence - should have never happened. Kamala killed their children."" In a post on Truth Social, Trump shared a statement from family members of the fallen soldiers honoured at the event, expressing their approval. “We had given our approval for President Trump’s official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured and so we can cherish these memories forever,” the families said in Trump's post.  But that goes against federal policy, an Arlington National Cemetery spokesperson told the BBC.  US law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities on the grounds of military cemeteries, including photographers, content creators or anyone directly supporting a partisan political candidate's campaign, the cemetery spokesperson said.  Utah Governor Spencer Cox, who is running for re-election, also attended the ceremony and posted a photo on X of himself with Trump and the family of Staff Sgt Darin Hoover, of Utah, who was killed during the withdrawal.  But he later came under fire for using the photo in a campaign email, forcing an apology post via X on Wednesday that acknowledged it should not have been sent: ""This was not a campaign event and was never intended to be used by the campaign."" Sgt Hoover's grave is next to that of Master Sgt Andrew Marckesano, who died by suicide after six tours in Afghanistan in 2020.    Sgt Marckesano's sister said that despite her family's support for the Hoover family, Trump campaign staff ""did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit"".  She urged visitors to remember that those buried there were ""real people"" who should be ""honoured and respected""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c785vyg55xyo,FBI: Trump gunman's motive still a mystery as new photos released,"Authorities said that Thomas Crooks - the shooter - appears to have viewed the Trump rally as a ""target of opportunity"".",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US authorities said that the man who attempted to kill former President Donald Trump acted alone and there is no sign of foreign involvement. But FBI officials stressed at a news briefing on Wednesday that a motive for the assassination attempt remains unknown, and they said that Thomas Crooks - the 20-year-old assailant - had a ""mixture of ideologies"". The law enforcement agency described Crooks's search history, and it released photos of the gun he used and the improvised explosive devices found in his car. Crooks attempted to shoot the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July. He grazed Trump’s ear, killed one man and seriously injured two others. Kevin Rojek, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said that Crooks began searching online for Trump campaign events starting in September 2023. He searched for events for both Trump and President Joe Biden, who was still the Democratic nominee at the time of the shooting. He also looked for the location of both the Republican and Democratic national conventions. “When… the Trump rally was announced early in July, he became hyper-focused on that specific event and looked at it as a target of opportunity,” Mr Rojek said. Crooks registered for the Trump rally one week in advance, Mr Rojek said. On the same day, the 20-year-old searched how far assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was from John F Kennedy when the Marine veteran fatally shot the US president in 1963.  Crooks also looked up “Where will Trump speak from at Butler Farm Show?” - the site of the rally. His search history showed that he had attempted to find bomb making instructions and ingredients as well, authorities said. ""We believe the subject engaged in detailed attack planning,"" Mr Rojek said.  FBI officials said Crooks’s online activities showed a “mixture of ideologies” and that they are continuing to look into his online presence. “We see no definitive ideology associated with our subject, either left leaning or right leaning,” Mr Rojek said. Crooks was a registered Republican. In 2021, he donated $15 to liberal campaign group ActBlue. Officials said that some anti-Semitic comments online “were associated with accounts associated with [Crooks]” and that they were working to determine whether he wrote them. The FBI has previously said that Crooks had at least two social media accounts which showed contradictory ideological views. The content of the accounts has not been made public. At the Butler rally, Crooks was on the roof of a nearby building for about six minutes. He fired eight shots at Trump, who was speaking on a stage, before a Secret Service sniper killed him.  During Wednesday's news conference, FBI officials also responded to criticism by conservatives, including Republican Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana, that the agency had cleaned up the crime scene and returned Crooks’s body to his family too quickly. Mr Rojek said that standard procedures were followed in the clean up of the site, that Crooks’s body was returned after an autopsy was completed and that it is not standard procedure to retain human remains indefinitely. The autopsy indicated that Crooks had no trace of illegal drugs or alcohol in his system. The FBI said that the Crooks family has co-operated with their investigation. A Congressional task force including both Republicans and Democrats is in the process of investigating the security failures that led to the shooting. Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service at the time of the shooting, stepped down from her position last month after facing intense pressure from lawmakers.  She has since been replaced by Ronald Rowe as acting director. At least five Secret Service agents have been placed on administrative leave following the security lapse.  Last week, Trump held an outdoor rally in North Carolina - his first since the assassination attempt. He appeared behind a podium surrounded by bulletproof glass.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rd1yzgl0qo,Kamala Harris has thrived in debates - will her tactics work on Trump?,"Debates have played a major role in her political career, but the showdown on 10 September will have the highest stakes yet.",7 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"During a pivotal debate in the 2020 US presidential election, one candidate seemed to dominate the stage. They interrupted their rivals at strategic moments, sometimes speaking over them. They directly confronted an opponent, Joe Biden, generating headlines for days and had critics questioning whether they had breached some sort of unspoken political decorum. That candidate, however, wasn’t Donald Trump. It was Kamala Harris. On 10 September, Ms Harris will once again take to the debate stage. But this time, having gone one step further than 2020 by becoming the Democratic candidate for president, she will face Trump in a showdown that poses the toughest challenge of her campaign so far. Debates have played a major role in Ms Harris’s political career, from her run for California attorney general to her ascent to the vice-presidency. In watching four of her key debates back, it is clear that Ms Harris knows when to seize the spotlight, but also when to stand by as a rival administers a self-inflicted blow. Ms Harris will be hoping to utilise these instincts against the notoriously combative Trump. Her campaign will also want to dispel longstanding concerns about her political messaging skills that began with her failed run for the White House in 2020, and were only heightened by her fumbling some interviews in recent years. There is no room for error given how these events are defined by viral clips, so it is just as important for the Harris campaign that she avoids stumbling as it is for her to land a highlight-reel blow. “She needs to hold her own,” said Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, an organisation that supports women of colour in politics. “And she needs to communicate on the debate stage what she’s fighting for."" In her earliest debate appearances, Ms Harris found success by letting her opponents dismantle themselves. In a 2010 debate for the position of California attorney general, moderators asked Ms Harris and her Republican opponent Steve Cooley about a controversial practice known as double-dipping, which allows a public official to draw from their government salary as well as a pension. “Do you plan to double-dip by taking both a pension and your salary as attorney general?” a moderator asked the candidates. “Yes, I do,” Mr Cooley replied. “I earned it.” For a while, Ms Harris said nothing as he defended his position. “Go for it, Steve,” she eventually retorted. “You earned it!” Ms Harris’s campaign swifty cut the moment into an advertisement they used to hammer Mr Cooley as out of touch. She won the election by a razor-thin margin. And during a 2016 debate for a California US Senate seat, Ms Harris’s opponent inexplicably punctuated her closing statement with a dab – a dance move that was popular at the time. Ms Harris, who looked taken aback, waited a few beats before quipping: “So, there’s a clear difference between the candidates in this race.” Voters again backed Ms Harris. Both examples demonstrate Ms Harris’s eye for opportunity on the debate stage, as well as a sense for knowing when it is best to step back. “I think she is someone who uses silence incredibly well,” said Maya Rupert, a Democratic strategist who worked on Julián Castro and Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaigns. As she entered the national stage, Ms Harris proved adept at claiming the floor for herself, even amid a crowded field. One of her tried-and-tested tactics involves openly declaring her intention to speak, compelling her opponents – and the audience – to listen. The 2020 vice-presidential debate is remembered primarily for one line she directed at Mike Pence as he began to interrupt: “Mr Vice-President, I’m speaking.” And just weeks ago - illustrating that the riposte was more than a one-off - Ms Harris used the same line on Gaza protesters who interrupted her rally in Detroit. “I’m speaking now,” she told them. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” “She’s using something that a lot of black women have used effectively, which is to insist on their time, and to insist to be heard,” said Ms Allison. “She’s very effective in making sure that she is heard, and respected.” But perhaps her most memorable debate moment came in 2019, when Ms Harris, then a US senator, stopped all crosstalk during the Democratic primary debate in Miami to challenge Mr Biden over his past position on a policy known as bussing. She criticised Mr Biden for working with lawmakers who opposed the Civil Rights Era policy of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Ms Harris said. She paused for effect before telling Mr Biden: “And that little girl was me.” Nina Smith, who was the travelling press secretary for presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg at the time, said the moment made rival campaigns sit up and pay attention. “What it showed us as a team is if she sees an opening she’s going to go after it,” Ms Smith recalled to the BBC. “I think it made her a rather skilled debater in that regard. It’s definitely something we watched out for, any sort of unexpected punch that could come from Senator Harris at the time.” “It showed that prosecutorial ability… to really highlight weaknesses in her opponents,” she said. By the end of the debate, Ms Harris had spoken more than any other candidate except Mr Biden. Her campaign announced it raised $2 million in 24 hours after the debate. But despite the breakthrough moment and subsequent surge in the polls, Ms Harris later struggled to articulate her own position on bussing. It only served to underscore the concerns with her messaging and ability to articulate a consistent policy position. The episode was one of many messaging stumbles Ms Harris made that ultimately sank her first presidential bid. Her failure to articulate a consistent policy agenda was one of the most common reasons cited, and it is an issue she needs to clarify quickly at the debate when she will almost certainly be pressed on policy specifics. Republicans have circulated clips of Ms Harris’ public remarks for years to ridicule her speaking style and cast her as inept. She has used verbose phrases when speaking off the cuff, and while a few turns of phrase have been embraced by her supporters, opponents have often criticised her for a lack of clarity. In a recent CNN interview, her first since becoming the nominee, she gave an answer on climate change which illustrated the issue. “It is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time,” Ms Harris said. On a debate stage, however, speaking time is limited and clarity of message is crucial. The looming debate on ABC News will be her biggest chance yet to reset public opinion, and past debates show that Ms Harris often brings a sharp toolkit to these events and is able to land blows. But the pressure of those past debates will pale in comparison to the stakes when she comes face-to-face with Trump for the first time. Even for the most experienced politicians, Trump presents a formidable challenge, the strategists agreed. In a 2016 debate against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, he famously stalked her around the stage, drawing all attention to him even when it was her turn to answer. His first 2020 presidential debate against Mr Biden devolved into an unintelligible melee when Trump kept interrupting. At one point, Mr Biden grew so irritated he snapped: “Will you shut up, man?” “Donald Trump is a unique and special case in that you never really know what’s coming,” said Ms Smith, who has prepared Democratic candidates for debates. “During debate prep, I would not allow her to get comfortable, in order for her to develop some sort of instinct, or callousness, to anything that could come up.” Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, is skilled at back-and-forth exchanges on the debate stage. It is something she has also demonstrated during heated Senate hearings when she has grilled Trump officials and Supreme Court nominees. But the format of the upcoming ABC debate may limit her ability to flex her prosecutorial skills, as the microphones will reportedly be muted when it is the other person’s turn to speak. This likely means, based on the Biden-Trump debate in June which had the same rules, that she will be fielding tricky questions from moderators as opposed to clashing with Trump.  And when Ms Harris is on the end of prosecutorial questions, as opposed to giving them, she has floundered in the past, such as in a notorious 2021 interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt in which she struggled when pressed on the issue of illegal immigration. One pitfall that Ms Rupert could envision for the Harris camp is their candidate being drawn into a lengthy debate over facts with Trump. That could muddle the debate for voters, and leave viewers with an impression that he has dominated the conversation. She suggested a third tactic for Ms Harris to add to her arsenal – not to prosecute, or remain silent, but to ignore. “She has an important opportunity here to get her point across,” Ms Rupert said, “And not be overly burdened by what he is doing next to her.” North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

The group's songs and videos, also including Money, Money, Money and Dancing Queen, were also played at the event in Minnesota in July, according to Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. In a statement to the Reuters news agency, the band's record label Universal Music said: ""Together with the members of Abba, we have discovered that videos have been released where Abba's music has been used at Trump events, and we have therefore requested that such use be immediately removed and taken down.""  The label said no permission or licence had been granted to Mr Trump's campaign. Abba are the latest in a long list of artists or their estates who have objected to Mr Trump using their music to promote his presidential campaign. This week, Foo Fighters took to social media to say they hadn't granted permission for My Hero to be used at a Trump rally. The Trump campaign said they had permission to use the song, according to The Independent. A spokesperson for the band told the publication that any royalties received from the Trump campaign using the song would be donated to Kamala Harris's campaign. Last month, Celine Dion's team condemned the ""unauthorised"" use of a clip of My Heart Will Go On, and the family of late soul singer Isaac Hayes ordered Mr Trump to stop playing Hold On, I'm Coming and demanded $3m (£2.4m) in licensing fees. In March, the estate of Sinéad O'Connor demanded he stop playing Nothing Compares 2 U, saying she would have been ""disgusted, hurt, and insulted"". Previously, Adele, REM and the Rolling Stones are among the big names who have demanded he doesn't use their songs. However, musicians have only had limited success in stopping politicians from using their music. In the US, campaigns are required to obtain a Political Entities Licence from music rights body BMI, which gives them access to more than 20 million tracks for use in their rallies. Artists and publishers can ask for their music to be withdrawn from the list, but it seems that organisers rarely check the database to ensure they have clearance."

Basildon Council has revealed the waste collection changes brought in by the previous Conservative administration, which sparked anger from residents, cost an additional £1.2m. This includes the hiring of four additional waste collection crews at a cost of £600,000, an extra £200,000 in fuel costs, and £400,000 in agency staff. The new Labour leader of the Essex council, Gavin Callaghan, said it had put ""unnecessary financial"" strain on the council’s budget. Last November, the previous administration brought in changes including a fortnightly recycling scheme that required people to separate their recycling themselves into six different sections. The new rules replaced a weekly black sack service across the borough. A petition was signed by 2,606 people who were frustrated with the changes. At the time, the council insisted the changes were introduced in a bid to improve poor recycling rates across the borough, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Since the local elections in May, Labour is the largest party at the borough council, after the Conservatives were defeated and no party achieved overall control. Mr Callaghan said the ""mishandling of the waste service reform was just the tip of the iceberg"" and cited how the previous council’s inability to fill vacant food and beverage units at the cinema also cost taxpayers lost projected revenue. He said the new council was also addressing the regeneration of Basildon town centre and tackling the ""soaring costs of temporary accommodation, which are currently crippling the council’s budget"". ""The waste changes have been a disaster on Basildon’s streets and on the balance sheet,"" he said. ""These compounded failures have left Basildon in a precarious financial situation, which we are now working diligently to fix. ""The new administration is taking immediate action to rectify these issues. This includes reforming the waste service to return to a simpler and more cost-effective weekly collection system. ""The people of Basildon deserve better. We are committed to fixing the mess we inherited and ensuring that our community receives the quality services it deserves, without the burden of unnecessary costs.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6rj3n8nrdo,Trump signals backing for Florida marijuana legalisation,"The US presidential hopeful appeared to signal his support, placing him at odds with other Republicans.",1 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has signalled that he will vote in favour of legalising marijuana for personal use in his home state of Florida, ahead of a ballot on the issue in November. The Republican presidential nominee wrote on his Truth Social platform that voters are highly likely to approve the measure ""whether people like it or not"" and therefore ""it should be done correctly"".  The former US president's stance puts him at odds with other senior Republican figures, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has argued that legalising recreational cannabis use would ""be bad for quality of life"". Medicinal marijuana was made legal in Florida in 2016. Cannabis for both personal and medical use is legal in 24 US states, according to the Pew Research Centre. A further 14 states have legalised medical marijuana. Trump said: ""Someone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other states. ""We do not need to ruin lives and waste taxpayer dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them.""  The proposal is one of a number of amendments Florida residents will vote on in November at the same time as the US chooses its new president. Trump is running against incumbent vice-president and Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris.  On legalising marijuana for personal use, Trump said that there would need to be rules in place to ""prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat-run cities"". Mr DeSantis has claimed that making cannabis legal for recreational use ""would turn Florida into San Francisco or Chicago"" - both cities in Democrat-run states.  Marijuana was legalised in Illinois 2020 and between January and July this year, cannabis sales reached more that $1bn (£760m), according to state government statistics.  In California, where personal use was legalised in 2016, marijuana sales reached $4.4bn last year. However, it is not clear how those figures compare to black market sales of cannabis which, according to some, still thrives. Legalised growers and sellers have to get permits and pay tax, which can prove costly and risk making their cannabis more expensive.    ""The black market is very pervasive and it is definitely larger than the legal market,"" Bill Jones, the head of enforcement for California's Department of Cannabis Control, told US broadcaster NPR earlier this year.  Trump has already caused some confusion about a different amendment that will be on Florida's ballot in November. On Friday he said he would vote against a measure in Florida that would protect abortion rights, after facing backlash from conservative supporters. Abortion is banned in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy - the amendment proposes expanding that to 24 weeks. Trump had initially signalled support for the proposal.  His campaign later claimed he had not said how he would vote in ballot, simply that he thought that the six week period was ""too short"". The following day, Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago estate is in Palm Beach, Florida, said he would be voting ""no"".  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj081mrlm7eo,Scholz vows to speed up deportations after Solingen stabbings,"The German chancellor also promised to tighten laws on weapons ownership ""very quickly"".",26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Irregular migration into Germany ""must go down"" after a Syrian man who came to Germany as an asylum seeker was charged with killing three people in an attack in the western town of Solingen last week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.  ""This was terrorism, terrorism against us all,"" Mr Scholz said during a visit to Solingen on Monday. Mr Scholz also said his government would have to do ""everything we can to ensure that those who cannot and should not stay here in Germany are repatriated and deported"" and that deportations would be sped up if necessary. He also promised to tighten laws on weapons ownership ""very quickly"".  The political ramifications of the tragedy started reverberating across Germany as soon as officials confirmed the suspect in Friday’s deadly stabbings was a Syrian refugee. The alleged attacker - named as 26-year-old Issa Al H. - is suspected of links to the terror organisation Islamic State. An already heated debate about migration has become even more ferocious. A day after the attacks, conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz demanded an end to taking in refugees from Syria and Afghanistan and called for controls on all of Germany’s borders.    Alice Weidel, leader of the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD), has gone a step further and wants a complete stop to all migration.  Experts say such suggestions are not feasible and incompatible with German and European Union law. Mr Scholz’s governing centre-left SPD party says Germany remains committed to its legal and humanitarian commitments to help those fleeing persecution.  But his government has also pledged to deport migrants who have committed serious crimes and people whose application for asylum has been rejected. The suspect in the Solingen attack came to Germany in 2022 as a Syrian refugee. Usually Syrians have a good chance of being granted asylum in Germany.  But his application was rejected and he was ordered to be deported to Bulgaria, because he had already registered for asylum there. Officials say when they tried to deport him, they could not locate him and he remained in Germany.  Now a row has broken out about who was responsible for that failing. Germany does not generally deport people back to unsafe countries or war-zones such as Syria, or Afghanistan - which would involve negotiating with the Taliban government. But there are calls to change that. For years Germany has been embroiled in a controversial debate about migration. Local councils say their budgets are stretched. There are also calls to speed up the application process and allow refugees to work sooner which some say would help them integrate into German society. Given the large numbers of refugees Germany takes in, the country generally copes well, and this year refugee numbers appear to have been dropping.  However, Germany typically takes in hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers every year. In 2023 just over 350,000 people applied for asylum. In addition, around 1.2 million Ukrainians have arrived in Germany since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.  Compared to other countries which take in fewer refugees, terror attacks connected to asylum seekers in Germany are rare.  The last major incident was in 2016, when 12 people were killed when an Islamist extremist drove a lorry into a Christmas market in Berlin. But this latest attack may have a huge political impact.  On Sunday, two large eastern German states - Saxony and Thuringia - will hold key regional elections.  The AfD, which is hoping to do well and may even win the most votes, is already using the attack as part of its campaign.  Within hours of the stabbing, the AfD - referring to the party's regional leader in Thuringia, Björn Höcke - posted a video on social media captioned with the words “Höcke or Solingen”."

President Samia was visiting the Tanzania Wildlife Authority (TAWA) when she was introduced to the unruly lion by officials.   “Does that lion have a name?” asked President Samia. ""If not, name him Tundu Lissu.” Mr Lissu is the leader of the main opposition party Chadema. He was arrested earlier this year for attempting to hold a youth rally, which police say was intended to incite violence.  “It is because he is always unsettled,” Ms Samia said as she gave the lion its new name on Sunday.  So what does Mr Lissu make of his namesake? It seems he's taking it in his stride.  “I come from a family of heroes,” he told local media. “My great-grandfather killed a lion that attacked him and his cattle,"" he said. Mr Lissu is a notable government critic and survived a gun attack in 2017. His car was sprayed with over 17 bullets, but he escaped with heavy injuries. The perpetrators were never found. Mr Lissu ran for office in 2020, but lost against the late John Magufuli. Ms Samia, who was then the vice-president, became leader in 2021 after Mr Magufuli died while in office. Elections are due next year, with President Samia planning to run for a second term. Mr Lissu is also planning to run for president once again.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w79w380dwo,Why Harris campaign is fighting for unmuted debate mics,They will be muted when it's the other candidate's turn to speak - but Ms Harris's team are pushing back.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are set to square off in their first presidential debate next month, but the campaigns are still warring over logistics - namely relating to the microphones.  Trump's campaign is pushing for the microphones to be muted when it is the other person's turn to speak. This is a rule that was originally requested by Joe Biden when he was the Democratic candidate. Trump's team ultimately agreed to the request - which was an apparent effort by Biden's campaign to limit interruptions. (The pair's chaotic first 2020 debate was marred by constant interruptions, with Mr Biden eventually snapping at his rival: ""Will you shut up, man?"") Some analysts say the Trump campaign's eagerness to keep the muting rule in place for the Harris debate on 10 September may be due to the positive reception he received for what was a more reserved performance than many had anticipated against Mr Biden in June. In practice, it made interruptions impossible. The former president, however, appears less concerned by the rule and to some extent even undermined his own team's statements calling for it to remain in place. ""[It] doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have [the microphones] probably on,"" he said on Monday. ""But the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time. In that case, it was muted,"" he added. Trump posted on social media Tuesday afternoon that he has ""reached an agreement"" with ABC for the 10 September debate. He did not mention mics in the post, but said again that the ""Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate"", which included muted mics in its rules.  He also accused the network in the post of being ""unfair"", but also said his team was assured that the debate would be ""fair and equitable"".  It was not clear Tuesday whether the Harris campaign had signed off on the terms Trump said he agreed to with ABC. The Harris campaign wants to shift the agreed rules with just two weeks to go so that both candidates' microphones will be unmuted for the entire debate. What do they think they could gain from this change? More generally, they believe it has the potential to show viewers a more unfiltered, even ill-tempered, Trump who would be audible throughout the entire time Ms Harris is speaking. ""Our understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,"" a statement from Harris's spokesman said. ""The reason she's saying to unmute the mics is because Trump is uncontrolled,"" Ameshia Cross, a Democratic strategist and political analyst, told the BBC.  Ms Cross said Trump's rallies and Truth Social posts, where he has launched repeated personal attacks against Ms Harris, offer examples of how he may approach the looming debate on ABC News. Those attacks ""turn off voters"" particularly women voters, voters of colour and young voters, Ms Cross said.  Strategists have also suggested Trump's insults may turn off crucial undecided voters. “One of the ways to win over swing voters is not by personal attacks,” Kevin Madden, a longtime Republican strategist, told the New York Times. “By nature, they don’t love partisan politics."" If Trump's microphone is unmuted while Harris is speaking, the likelihood of an audible insult or interruption ramps up. And the Harris campaign may feel a more aggressive Trump who is able to interrupt at will could benefit them by turning off these swing voters. This matters in an election that will be decided by a relatively small group of undecided voters in a handful of battleground states such as Pennsylvania, where the debate is being held.  ""He’s very prone to having intemperate outbursts and... I think the [Harris] campaign would want viewers to hear [that],"" a person familiar with the debate negotiations told Politico this week. The Trump campaign, according to reports, are eager for their candidate to focus on the key issues and not on personal attacks. One ally who speaks to the former president every week recently told the BBC's Katty Kay that Trump will win in November if he sticks to talking about the economy, the border and crime. It is fair to assume that if the candidates are only audible during their allotted answer time, then the debate is more likely to focus on the issues, as the Trump campaign wants, and not tense clashes and heated exchanges which would be possible with live mics. Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist, told the BBC that he believes the Harris campaign's effort to unmute the microphones is an attempt to move the debate away from the issues and into the arena of grabby viral moments. ""They're not sure they can win on the issues so what they're looking for is any way possible to have a viral moment,"" he said.  Ms Harris has had these moments in the past. During the 2020 vice-presidential debate between then-vice-president Mike Pence and Ms Harris, a clip of her pushing back on an interruption was widely shared. ""I'm speaking, Mr Vice-President,"" she said. Mr O’Connell said the Trump campaign should continue to aggressively push for the muted microphones because those are the rules the Democratic campaign originally came up with. He said the message should be: ""We let you write the rules, we are sticking with the same rules."" Ms Cross, however, suggested the Harris campaign is calling Trump's bluff and has the upper hand. ""If he does not want them unmuted, he's going to look weak, like he cannot control himself,"" she said. While Ms Cross said Trump was trying to ""weasel"" his way out of the debate by attacking the network, Mr O'Connell said the Republican nominee would show up regardless for what is set to be a major moment. ""The 10 September debate could be the most consequential moment between now and election day,"" he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm7n0xgnzzo,Trump adds ex-Democrats Gabbard and RFK Jr to transition team,"The former progressives have endorsed Trump, while a group of former Republicans has declared support for Kamala Harris.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard to his transition team, days after the two former Democrats endorsed his campaign.  Ms Gabbard is a former congresswoman and military veteran who ran to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2020, before distancing herself from the party. Mr Kennedy initially launched a bid to win the Democratic nomination this time around, but later ran as an independent before dropping out and endorsing Trump.  Meanwhile, more than 200 Republicans who served under previous presidents and party leaders have given their backing to Trump's rival, Kamala Harris. In an open letter, former staffers for George HW Bush and George W Bush, and Senators John McCain and Mitt Romney said another Trump administration would endanger American democracy. The Republicans wrote: ""Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov Walz. That’s to be expected.  ""The alternative, however, is simply untenable.""  The Trump campaign said Ms Gabbard and Mr Kennedy would serve as honorary transition team co-chairs, along with Trump's sons and running mate JD Vance. Presidential transition teams kick into action when a candidate is elected. They help select political appointees and set priorities for the incoming administration. Trump senior advisor Brian Hughes said that the endorsements of the two former Democrats show how the campaign was earning support ""across partisan lines"".   ""We look forward to having their powerful voices on the team as we work to restore America’s greatness,"" he said in a statement. On Monday, Trump welcomed Ms Gabbard, 43, to a stage in Detroit, in the key swing state of Michigan.  Ms Gabbard, who represented Hawaii in Congress from 2013 to 2021, quit the Democratic Party in 2022, complaining of its ""wokeness"".  She appeared alongside Trump to commemorate US service personnel killed in an attack in Afghanistan three years prior, using it as an opportunity to criticise the Biden administration. Thirteen US service members and more than 100 Afghans were killed during the suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The incident occurred as American troops made a chaotic withdrawal from the country, and the Taliban returned to power. Ms Gabbard made frequent criticisms of US military interventionism during her time in Congress. Appearing at Monday's event in Michigan, Ms Gabbard said she was appealing to Democrats, Republicans and independents alike to pick Trump at the ballot box in November - saying it was a matter of ""saving our country and serving the people"". Her official backing of Trump marks the culmination of a remarkable political journey over the last decade that began on the progressive left of the Democratic Party. She was the first Hindu member of the US Congress, going on to serve as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. When Ms Gabbard ran for president in 2020, she championed liberal issues like government-run healthcare, free college tuition and gun control.  But Joe Biden became the Democratic nominee that year, and went on to win the presidency. Ms Gabbard endorsed him, but quit the party two years later. She has since staked out conservative views on issues including abortion and transgender rights, and has become a regular and outspoken guest on Fox News. She has also been accused of spreading ""promoting Russian propaganda"" by officials in Ukraine.  By early 2024, she was singing the praises of Mr Biden's rival, Trump, who will this time compete for the White House against Ms Harris. In the subsequent months, it was even speculated that Ms Gabbard could be in the frame as Trump's potential running mate for November - a role that ultimately went to Mr Vance. Mr Kennedy ended his independent presidential campaign on Friday and endorsed Trump, appearing alongside him at a rally in Arizona. The former president's allies have criticised both Mr Kennedy and Mr Gabbard over the years. Only four months ago, Trump called Mr Kennedy a “Radical Left Lunatic” who was “far more liberal than anyone running as a Democrat"". The two former Democrats are also known for being staunch environmentalists. Trump has promised to ramp up US fossil fuel production and regularly uses the slogan ""Drill, baby, drill!"" at his rallies. Top Democrats were quick to dismiss the endorsements from Ms Gabbard and Mr Kennedy.  “Rather than focusing on earning the support of hardworking Americans, Trump is more fixated on winning the backing of extremists like Gabbard and RFK Jr — and they’ll do nothing but weigh down his sinking ship of a campaign,” the party's Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd said in a statement.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlr46kepnjo,Harris unscathed after walking careful line in first interview,"There was no new ammunition for Republicans, but it highlighted the challenge she faces in pitching herself as a change candidate.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris’s apparent reluctance to give an extended broadcast interview meant that her sit-down with CNN on Thursday night assumed an exaggerated significance. And placed her under greater scrutiny. It was not a strong start. Initially, Ms Harris struggled to lay out what she would do on day one of the job, talking in sweeping generalisations about creating an opportunity economy and trying to lower the cost of living. Ms Harris has been prone to giving complex, detailed and often confusing answers. Her opponents like to mock her “word salads”. This wasn’t a major issue in this interview, but she will need to craft a more concise explanation of how she intends to make life more affordable for ordinary, working Americans if she wants her message on the economy to land. Throughout the interview, which she did along with her vice-presidential pick Tim Walz, Ms Harris appeared calm and confident. And, crucially, didn’t score any own goals. Asked about her shifting positions on some key policies since she last ran for president in 2019, Ms Harris said her values had not changed  – before confirming that she no longer supports a ban on fracking for natural gas or decriminalising illegal immigration. And when addressing Republicans' claim that she is soft on border issues, she pointed to her previous experience as a prosecutor in California. It is experience that Ms Harris often leans on, including in her attacks on Donald Trump, whose criminal conviction she frequently points out. “I'm the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organisations who are trafficking guns, drugs and human beings,” she told CNN's Dana Bash. “I'm the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws.” Immigration and the southern border is potentially Ms Harris’s greatest liability in this election. It is an issue many voters care about passionately right across the country – and one on which the Biden administration has had little to boast about given the high numbers of undocumented immigrants at the US southern border. Joe Biden specifically tasked Ms Harris with addressing the “root causes” of Central American immigration. Republicans have used that brief to claim she was the “border tsar”, and therefore responsible for the record high rates of illegal border crossings in recent years. When pressed on the issue, Ms Harris told CNN on Thursday that she would resurrect a recent border security bill that was agreed in congress but scuppered by Trump, who told Republicans not to support it. The former president was worried it would damage him politically if the Biden administration was seen to be taking action on immigration. In reality, that move provided Democrats with a convenient talking point when challenged about why it has taken them so long to illegal border crossings. Ms Harris said she would push that legislation again and make sure it came to her desk so she could sign it. As she continues to campaign over the coming weeks before the election on 5 November, Ms Harris will have to walk a careful line. Does she talk up her role in the Biden administration? Or present herself as a candidate for change who represents the future not the past? On Thursday, she was scrupulously loyal to President Biden and did not try to distance herself from his policies. The problem is that if she wants to take credit for lowering the cost of prescription drugs for pensioners, for example, then she also risks taking the blame for high inflation. It is tricky territory. The Harris campaign often uses the phrase “we’re not going back”. And in this interview, while she was loyal to Mr Biden, she also repeatedly said it was time to “turn the page on the last decade”.  She then had to explain that she meant a decade of bitterness and division, not the last three and a half years of the Biden-Harris administration when she has been in power. It was a moment that deftly illustrated the challenge Ms Harris faces in presenting herself as a candidate of change. As Trump has struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms Harris, he has resorted to insults. He questioned her racial identity when he said at a recent event that “she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black”. Given a chance to respond directly to that on Thursday, Ms Harris shrugged it off. She said her opponent was using “the same old, tired playbook”. It is almost certainly a deliberate strategy not to engage with Trump’s personal attacks on the first female candidate of colour to be the presidential nominee for one of the major parties. Ms Harris does not talk about shattering the glass ceiling in the way Hillary Clinton did in 2016. And she says very little about the historic nature of a black woman running for president. She told CNN that she in the race because she believes she is the best person to do the job – regardless of race and gender Trump, meanwhile, posted his one-word verdict of the interview on his social media platform – ""BORING"". The Harris campaign will have taken that as high praise. After all, her most important job was to ensure she did not give Republicans any new ammunition to use against her."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58m308glro,Top-level meeting shows China - and Xi - still a priority for Biden,"Jake Sullivan is on his first visit to China as national security adviser, for talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Jake Sullivan has been welcomed to China on his first visit as US national security adviser. He will hold talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi as the two countries try to stabilise relations. Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have met four times over 16 months in Vienna, Malta, Washington and Bangkok. Their last meeting in January was shortly after a high-stakes summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden that sought to reset frosty ties.  This week's talks - scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday - signal that China is still a priority for the Biden administration, even as the retiring president enters his final  months in office.  Both Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have already acknowledged a need to find common ground after disagreements between their nations. Could another presidential summit be on the cards?  The White House is trying not to explicitly link Mr Sullivan's trip to the US presidential election. But it's hard to ignore the timing.  If Mr Sullivan is able to lay the groundwork for a final Biden-Xi summit, his trip would tie up the ends of the US president's most consequential - and fraught - foreign policy relationship.  US and Chinese diplomats always acknowledge that talks between Washington and Beijing are never easy. And there is a lot to talk about.  With the unexpected turn the US election has taken with Biden bowing out in favour of Kamala Harris, China is watching closely for what the next presidency might have in store. Donald Trump has made it clear he will raise tariffs further on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the trade war he kicked off in 2019.  While Mr Biden's administration saw merit in diplomacy, he didn't reverse Trump-era tariffs and has added more - in May he announced steep duties on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, and steel.   Mr Biden has also strengthened alliances across Asia to combat China’s rising influence and beefed up Washington’s military presence - which, in turn, has rattled Beijing.    So far, the Harris campaign has not given many clues about how she plans to manage the relationship with China.  And the White House has made clear that Mr Sullivan's visit is meant to continue the work of the Biden administration, rather than set the tone for the next president. But China is likely looking ahead anyway.  Beijing will use this opportunity with Mr Sullivan to clarify its own priorities. It will hope that all parties in America are listening - China's ministry of foreign affairs has described this as a “critical juncture” between the world’s two biggest economies. For China, the red line is and always will be Taiwan. It claims the self-governing island and has repeatedly said it will not tolerate any signs that Washington is encouraging Taiwanese independence.  High-profile diplomatic visits, such as a controversial one by then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022, or recognition of Taiwan's elections or its elected leaders, fall into that category.   Chinese state media has said Beijing will focus on expressing grave concerns, stating its position, and making serious demands on matters such as the ""Taiwan question"". China will also have some strong words for Mr Sullivan on trade. Beijing has described US tariffs on Chinese goods as “unreasonable” and has urged Washington to ""stop politicising and securitising economic and trade issues"" and ""take more measures to facilitate people-to-people exchanges between the two countries"". When he came to power, Mr Biden wanted to set ties with China on an even keel after what he saw as the chaos and unpredictability of the Trump White House.  His administration has wanted to “responsibly manage” rivalry with Beijing; to demonstrate American power and competition with China through stealth not bravado. But that strategy has been upended amid the turbulence of events.  Last year, crisis engulfed the direct relationship when an American fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over US territory.  The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have further sharpened the tone.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing in April with a warning -   Washington would act if China did not stop supplying Russia with microchips and machine parts to build weapons used in its war in Ukraine.  He accused his Chinese counterparts of ""helping to fuel the biggest threat"" to European security since the Cold War. His warning materialised with a raft of sanctions on Chinese firms over their alleged support of the Russian military.  This is a tricky subject that China keeps trying to bat away, but Washington is insistent, and Mr Sullivan is likely to bring it up again. China's increasing assertiveness in Asia has also made the US wary of the impact of those ties further afield - particularly with Iran, which allies itself with Moscow and also arms Israel’s adversaries.  Finally, in America, there is the devastating domestic impact of Chinese-manufactured ""pre-cursor"" chemicals to make synthetic opioids like fentanyl, overdoses of which are killing more Americans than ever and the crisis has laid waste to entire towns. Last year’s summit between Mr Biden and Mr Xi in San Fransisco was meant to make progress on these issues.  Since then, despite the tariffs and the stern rhetoric, Washington and Beijing have acknowledged their differences - and reports of the two sides striking a deal on curbing fentanyl production are a good sign. In April, when the BBC accompanied US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his visit to Shanghai and Beijing, the public elements of some of his meetings with senior Chinese officials felt like a steely stand-off.  It was a show of diplomatic strength meant for each side's domestic audience. And this will undoubtedly be a part of Mr Sullivan’s trip too, as he tries to bolster Mr Biden's diplomacy in the waning months of his presidency.  But these meetings serve another fundamental purpose - face-to-face time between two rival, inter-dependent economies as they battle mutual distrust and try to probe each other’s real intentions. It seems that Jake Sullivan's previous meetings with Wang Yi have quietly laid the groundwork for what both sides call “stable relations”. In a recent speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington, Mr Sullivan said that he and Mr Wang had ""increasingly gotten to the point of setting aside the talking points and really having strategic conversations”. He described the character of those conversations as “direct”, including one on the war in Ukraine.  ""Both of us left feeling that we didn’t agree or see eye-to-eye on everything but that there was a lot of work to carry forward.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62305qx946o,I heard years of Grenfell testimony. Here's why the disaster could have been prevented,Opportunities missed and warnings unheeded - what the public inquiry into the fire has been told.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"There are many moments where you could begin the story of Grenfell Tower. One is in 1972, when a section of cramped west London terraced streets in Notting Dale had just been torn down. The vision was to replace them with an entirely new community. The Lancaster West Estate would have three blocks, each leading to a central 24-storey concrete tower - Grenfell. Early plans included shops, offices, a swimming pool and gardens. But plans for these amenities were quickly abandoned. Just five years after Grenfell Tower opened in 1974, the early optimism had faded. Residents were already complaining about vandalism, broken lifts and lights, and of the estate feeling impersonal. More than 30 years later, some residents spoke of slum-like conditions. Then a new refurbishment began. It promised lower heating bills, new boilers, a completely new look for the building. It was this refurbishment that would cover the tower’s external walls with combustible materials and lead to the catastrophic fire that killed 72 people in 2017. Next week, the public inquiry into the disaster will produce its final report, setting out what led to the worst residential fire since World War Two - one the inquiry has heard was both foreseeable and preventable. I’ve been covering that inquiry since 2018, listening to hundreds, possibly thousands of hours of evidence about the layers of opportunities missed and warnings unheeded at every level. This is a story of corporate deceit, government deregulation drives and a construction industry in a race to the bottom. Dr Barbara Lane is a fire safety specialist who was one of the inquiry’s main expert witnesses, giving days of evidence. She’s upfront and straight-talking, often telling the barristers why their questions were wrong. In person, though, when she talks about her experiences inside the block in the fire’s aftermath, her manner is completely different. Quietly, she recalls the darkness, the black smoke-stained walls, a half-burnt bedroom where only a cot remained. What struck her was the humanity of it, she says: “What the humans went through.” To understand how a refurbishment could have created the possibility of such a disaster, we have to look at what underpinned all that work - the building regulations. When Grenfell was constructed, those regulations were set by an act of parliament. Grenfell: Building a Disaster For the past six years, a public inquiry has heard evidence about the worst residential fire in UK peacetime. Kate Lamble has reported on it from the beginning. She examines what created the conditions for a disaster that was both foreseeable and preventable. Listen on BBC Sounds In the 1980s, however, Margaret Thatcher wanted to reduce government intervention. Regulations stopped listing precise rules, simply describing instead what the end result should be. The external walls of a building, the regulations now stated, should simply offer “adequate resistance” to fire - a standard the public inquiry has already concluded Grenfell Tower did not meet. How to achieve this was contained in government guidance, not regulations. Dr Lane says this shift gave the industry a false confidence to not really care as much as they should about safety. As early as the 1990s, there were signs of weakness in the new guidance. It suggested that cladding panels should meet a certain fire safety standard known as Class 0. But materials which met that standard were soon involved in fires. On 11 June 1999, a dropped cigarette started a fire in Garnock Court, a 14-storey block in Irvine, Ayrshire. News reports described it igniting like matchwood. One man was killed. The corner flats had been surrounded by plastic cladding that should have met the Class 0 standard. Brian Donohoe, the then-local MP, says he pushed for all combustible cladding to be banned and removed. His Labour colleagues, then in government, did not agree. One secretary of state, he says, told him “it would cost millions”. A parliamentary select committee recommended that all cladding on high-rise buildings should either be entirely non-combustible, or put through large-scale fire tests to prove it wasn’t a risk. These tests were introduced, but Class 0 remained in the guidance. England and Wales continued to be a market for combustible cladding. Garnock Court wasn’t the only warning. In 2009, flames at Lakanal House, a south London tower block, spread rapidly into combustible panels outside. Six people were killed. Four years later, a coroner called for a review of the building regulation guidance. The government agreed to do this by 2016 or 2017. But by the time of the Grenfell fire, this work had not begun, despite repeated demands from MPs in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fire Safety. This was a period of snap elections and referendums. The minister responsible for building regulations changed three times in as many years. Ministers also say they were not briefed on the importance of the Lakanal House fire. Statistics also showed fewer people were dying in fires. One minister told the inquiry they took comfort from that that there was no urgent problem. At the public inquiry, one junior civil servant admitted there were a number of occasions “where I could have potentially prevented this happening”. Brian Martin advised ministers on the part of the building regulation guidance that covered fire safety. Over the years, he was given a series of warnings about the use of combustible materials on high-rise residential buildings. After a cladding fire in Dubai in 2015, Mr Martin was approached by industry figures who told him that the combustible products involved in the blaze - the very type of cladding later installed on Grenfell Tower - were being sold in the UK. Mr Martin has acknowledged he did not escalate that warning to his bosses. “I struggle to come to terms with why I didn't do that,“ he told the inquiry. We should remember the 2010s were the era of slashing red tape, of health and safety culture ""gone mad"". According to Mr Martin: ""Regulation was a dirty word."" Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, in 2011 a policy of “one in, one out” was adopted. Ministers could not introduce a regulation unless they abolished one too. By 2016, under the Conservatives, that became “one in, three out”. Brian Martin and his superiors have said they understood fire safety was not exempt from the government’s deregulation drive - something ministers have strongly denied. The Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities says it has since taken a number of actions, including banning combustible materials on high-rise buildings. It was the view that first attracted Marcio Gomes to his 21st-floor flat in Grenfell, he tells me. On New Year’s Eve, he would invite friends to watch the fireworks. He remembers when talk started of refurbishing the building. Posters showed how it might look with metallic-looking cladding fitted. Residents were asked which colour they’d prefer, which finish? Fire safety was never discussed. At the public inquiry, there have been questions about how each of the materials installed on Grenfell were tested. The cladding was made of thin sheets of aluminium with a core of combustible plastic. The inquiry has already found it to be the main cause of the spread of the fire. It was made in France by a company called Arconic and came with a certificate that said a “standard panel” met the fire safety standards contained in the government guidance. However, Arconic suggested their materials could be cut in two different ways. The first option, flat panels, had achieved the European fire standards described. The other option, cassettes, where the material had been bent and folded, had not. In fire tests, these performed “spectacularly” worse.  It was the bent cassettes that were fitted on to Grenfell Tower. Arconic received their certificate by only providing the results of the successful test on the flat panels, not the failed test on the cassettes. At the public inquiry, Claude Schmidt, the managing director of the company’s French office, accepted this could be seen as a “misleading half-truth”, but denied information was deliberately withheld. Arconic told us it acknowledges the part it played in supplying a material involved in the fire. But it says responsibility for fire safety compliance does not rest with it as the supplier, but with those who selected it for use. Ed Daffarn moved into Grenfell in 2001. In the following decade he describes the building falling into a period of managed decline. He welcomed the idea of a multi-million pound refurbishment. The initial design work was given to Studio E, architects who had worked on a nearby school and leisure centre. Only they had never clad a high-rise building before. A competitive process legally required for large expensive projects was avoided because Studio E deliberately deferred part of their fee - bringing down the upfront costs. At a meeting with the Tenant Management Organisation that ran the building on behalf of the local council, Ed Daffarn asked if the architects had experience with tower blocks and if not: “Why are we using them?” He says he never received an answer. During the refurbishment, Mr Daffarn says he can’t remember “a single meeting where I felt that our views or what we wanted was being listened to”. Many residents joined action groups to raise concerns about a range of fire safety issues including out-of-date equipment. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has acknowledged residents were not listened to as much as they should have been. The lead architect on the Grenfell refurbishment, Bruce Sounes, told the inquiry he did not familiarise himself with building regulations on fire safety. Nor did Studio E check the suitability of the materials they specified. At Studio E’s request, a company called Exova wrote three fire safety strategies for Grenfell Tower. All three stated the refurbishment would have no adverse effect on external fire spread. None even acknowledged the building would be clad. Exova staff have said they thought the architects would ask them to look at the cladding if necessary. With the initial design completed, the refurbishment was handed to a construction firm, Rydon, which became legally responsible for the design and build. Rydon’s bid had been lower than their nearest competitor - but still £800,000 over budget. In cases like this, what commonly happens next is a process known as “value engineering” - finding ways to cut costs without affecting performance. Two days after Rydon was officially appointed as the contractor, it sent details of proposed savings to the Tenant Management Organisation which ran the building. Non-combustible metal cladding, which the architects had preferred, would be replaced with a cheaper alternative, saving nearly £400,000. Based only on looks, the council’s planning department chose cassette panels, the most dangerous form. This cladding, with its combustible plastic core, was the primary cause of the fire’s spread. As is common in construction, Rydon hired sub-contractors, who then often hired their own. Almost all have argued they did not hold ultimate responsibility for checking the work for fire safety, pointing instead to another firm they presumed was doing it. The lead counsel at the public inquiry called this a “merry-go-round of buck-passing”. In 2016, the local council’s building control department signed off the refurbishment. The council accepts it should not have done so. The tower was transformed, but residents immediately spotted problems. “There were massive gaps above, below and beside the windows,” Ed Daffarn says. In the early hours of the 14 June 2017, those gaps would fill with smoke. The first fire engine arrived at Grenfell within five minutes. Crews saw wispy smoke and an orange glow. To them, this seemed normal. There were around five fires a week in high-rise flats in London. But this fire would quickly become something else, as it spread out of the window and climbed up the outside of the building through the combustible cladding and insulation. Having watched dozens of firefighters give evidence to the inquiry, it’s hard to think of even one who recognised what they were watching was a cladding fire. Front-line firefighting staff hadn’t been trained about the risks of fire spreading across the outside of a high-rise building. That is even though Andy Roe, who now leads the London Fire Brigade (LFB), accepts his organisation knew of these risks. ”It's fair to say that we didn't train people adequately enough,“ he says. He accepts this was a failure of the organisation’s obligation to its staff. Still, Mr Roe thinks it would have been very hard to foresee the extremity of the Grenfell fire. For more than an hour and a half, the LFB operated on the principle of “stay put” - advising residents they would be safest to remain in their flats until help arrived. This policy relies on flames and smoke being contained in a flat for at least 60 minutes, giving firefighters time to reach them. But at Grenfell, flames climbed 19 floors in just 18 minutes. Mr Roe recognises residents were advised to stay put for too long and that advice would have had an impact on residents’ decision-making that night. “Stay put” is still used by the LFB but it has now trained its crews to evacuate when necessary. Ed Daffarn was woken by a neighbour’s smoke alarm around 01:10 on 14 June 2017. When he opened his door, he was met with a wall of smoke. The spread of this smoke was aided by something that seems small, even insignificant: automatic door-closing mechanisms. These are meant to keep smoke inside a flat if a resident has to run outside to safety. But at Grenfell, not every door closed behind people as they fled. Workmen had removed some door-closers during repair work - including one flat on Ed Daffarn’s floor. He’d complained about it himself. Both the Tenant Management Organisation and Grenfell’s owners, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, were aware of this issue. The inquiry has been told a plan was put together to regularly check door-closers. But the idea was rejected. The council told us that it could and should have done more to keep its residents safe before the fire. It told the BBC it was wrong to tell the Tenant Management Organisation there should not be an inspection programme. On the night of the fire, flames quickly reached Ed’s neighbour’s flat, the one without an automatic door-closer. The resident ran out, leaving the door open, and smoke poured out into the hallway where Ed would find himself. Ed became lost in the corridor. As he panicked, a firefighter grabbed him and pulled him into the stairwell. These, then, are the layers of missed opportunities, the dozens of chances over decades for someone to step in, to ask a question, to change history. At the end of the hearings, the lead counsel to the inquiry said it will “be able to conclude with confidence that each and every one of the deaths that occurred in Grenfell Tower on 14 June 2017 was avoidable”. For me, Grenfell also reveals a series of unspoken truths about the British system.  How safety was regarded as, at best, not as a vote-winner; and at worst as an obstruction to the economy. How regulation was viewed as guidance to be bent. An inherent lack of curiosity - a presumption that someone else would check, that something that bad couldn’t happen here. More than 3,000 high- and mid-rise buildings across England are still being monitored because they have unsafe cladding. The recommendations made next week will attempt to ensure such a disaster can never happen again. As always the government will have no obligation to carry these out. Nor is there a formal process to monitor what they reject or why. It is another opportunity for change. One we may yet reflect on after future fires.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj087qrp3jro,Supreme Court limits Arizona voting without citizenship proof,The ruling raises the stakes for November's election in a state where Democrats eked out a narrow victory last time.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The US Supreme Court has granted a Republican request to partially reinstate an Arizona law demanding proof of American citizenship for voter registration. In a 5-4 ruling, justices reinstated part of a 2022 law that rejected such forms if the voter did not provide proof of citizenship. The law's full revival would have excluded more than 41,000 people from voting in November's election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The administration of President Joe Biden, who won Arizona in 2020 by just over 10,000 votes, had sued to stop the law. Thursday’s ruling revived the part of the Arizona law that requires residents to provide proof of American citizenship to register as voters in the state. It rejected, however, the law's provision to mandate that voters who used a separate federal registration form should submit such documentation. Michael Whatley, chairman of the RNC, said the ruling was a ""major victory for election integrity. American elections must be decided by American citizens"". However, the outcome is expected to have little impact on the looming general election as it does not affect any Arizonan already registered to vote, according to the Arizona Republic newspaper. The law was enacted in March 2022 by Doug Ducey, the then-Republican governor, to balance what he said was voting accessibility with election security. The Biden administration sued to revoke it in July of the same year, arguing that it was superseded by a 1993 federal law called the National Voter Registration Act. Advocacy groups also petitioned against the Arizona measure. Last September, Phoenix-based US District Judge Susan Bolton ruled in favour of the challenge, and blocked requirements for documentary proof at both state and national levels. A three-judge panel on the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to halt Judge Bolton's ruling. That prompted an emergency Supreme Court filing from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans. On Thursday five conservative justices granted the Republican request. A sixth conservative, Amy Coney Barrett, joined with the three liberal justices in opposing it. Arizona, which is expected to be one of the most competitive states in the coming election, has been a flashpoint in the battle over voting laws. It is the only state that requires voters to provide a birth certificate, a passport or one of a handful of other documents proving their citizenship. A closely watched Republican review of the 2020 presidential election found no evidence that irregularities marred Mr Biden's narrow victory over Trump."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3d72dxe5zo,Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?,The Democratic presidential nominee is facing some criticism for dodging the scrutiny of a solo interview.,29 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Three weeks ago, just days after being formally chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was pressed on her plans for a sit-down interview. “I’ve talked to my team,” she told reporters on the airport tarmac in Detroit. “I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” On Thursday night, Ms Harris will - just barely - make good on that promise, sitting down with CNN’s Dana Bash for her first major interview. But Ms Harris will not be there by herself. The vice-president will be joined by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for the prime-time appearance, airing  at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST). Ms Harris may have answered the question of when she would conduct an in-depth, substantive discussion of her candidacy and agenda - standard procedure for all major party presidential candidates. But with Mr Walz in tow, the decision to make this a joint appearance may also fuel growing criticism that after escaping the rigours of a months-long presidential primary, she is now dodging the scrutiny that comes with a solo interview. “I think it’s incredibly weak, weak sauce, to show up with your running mate,” said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W Bush, on CNN, adding that Harris had a “troubling lack of confidence"" in her own political ability. Still, supporters of Ms Harris insist that given the unprecedented nature of her candidacy following President Joe Biden's sudden departure from the race, she is taking things at a smart pace. “I think the cadence has been right,” said Peter Giangreco, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. “Win the nomination, pick your nominee, lay out your economic plan, do your convention and now do some sit-downs and amplify that.” Joint interviews featuring both members of a presidential ticket are not unusual.  Barack Obama and Joe Biden sat for an interview with 60 minutes after Mr Biden was selected as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Eight years later, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did the same. For Ms Harris and Mr Biden in 2020, they picked ABC’s 20/20. And less than a week after Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the pair were jointly interviewed on Fox. But since Mr Biden passed the torch to her late last month, Ms Harris has limited most of her engagement with the press to scripted and highly-controlled environments. Her last formal sit-down interview was on 24 June, more than two months and a political lifetime ago. Her occasional interactions with reporters - brief answers to shouted questions on her way to and from campaign events - have done little to quell Republican claims that she is shirking any opportunity to have her record and agenda put under the microscope. The harshest criticism comes from her Republican opponents, who have both given several interviews in the past month. “She’s not smart enough to do a news conference,” Mr Trump told media earlier in August. “She won’t do interviews with friendly people because she can’t do better than Biden.”  The Democratic nominee has enjoyed a surge in momentum since entering the race. Now, after her whirlwind introduction to American voters, she needs to ""reinforce"" that energy, said Republican strategist and Trump critic Chip Felkel.  “She’s gotta get out there,” he said. “She’s got to show that she can think under pressure, because that’s part of what the president has to do.” Since she campaigned in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Ms Harris has  switched her stance on several key policy positions, backing off some of her more liberal promises.  She has abandoned pledges to support Medicare for all (giving all Americans access to government-funded healthcare) and to ban fracking. And the vice-president now supports a bipartisan border bill that includes hundreds of millions of dollars on a border wall, something Ms Harris once called ""un-American"". These apparent changes could open her up to questions about being a policy flip-flopper - an unwelcome label for a candidate still trying to define herself.   But by doing a joint interview, the Harris campaign may have calculated that the pressure - and the difficult questions - will at least be shared between the two of them. And it ensures both are in lockstep when it comes to explaining policy. Mr Giangreco, the Democratic strategist, predicted Ms Harris and Mr Walz will try to turn the focus onto their economic plan, an agenda to lower the cost of living and provide economic security that she first announced at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, two weeks ago. Mr Giangreco also pointed to another potential benefit of a joint interview: drawing a contrast between Mr Walz and his Republican counterpart JD Vance who he has labelled as ""weird"". Still, the real impact of Ms Harris and Mr Walz’s sit-down won’t be known until it is done. Ms Harris’s record with high-pressure interviews is mixed. A 2021 conversation with NBC’s Lester Holt, in which she fumbled through questions about her role in the administration’s border policy, was widely regarded as a failure. But in a more recent appearance, a one-on-one with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, in which she defended Mr Biden’s calamitous debate performance, Ms Harris looked calm and confident amid a political firestorm. If this high-stakes CNN joint interview falls into the latter category, then the Harris campaign will hope much of the criticism will fall away, said Mr Felkel, the Republican strategist. “They just need to be able to say ‘See, we told you,’” he said. “And then keep moving.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylj0qg2rwo,Trump and Harris spar over muting debate microphones,The 10 September debate on ABC News is the only one that both candidates have officially committed to.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns are sparring over whether to mute one of the microphones when it is the other person's turn to speak during the pair's scheduled debate next month. The Harris campaign said in a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News that it wanted both candidates’ microphones to be live throughout the full broadcast. The Trump campaign reportedly wants the ABC debate, scheduled for 10 September, to be governed by the same rules agreed when Joe Biden was the Democratic candidate. That would mean the microphones being muted. The apparent impasse comes as the former president questioned the impartiality of the network and signalled he might even skip the debate. Before President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic party nominee, his campaign agreed with Trump's campaign to participate in two debates - one previously held in June on CNN and one to air on ABC News this September.  The Biden campaign negotiated the rules for the debate and agreed that the microphone would be muted when a candidate wasn't speaking.  The Trump campaign agreed to the rule, which was enforced during the June CNN debate.  But now, with just 15 days until the ABC News debate in Philadelphia is scheduled to air, the Harris campaign wants the microphones to be ""hot"" - meaning they will never be turned off for the duration of the debate.  This would allow the two candidates to interrupt and speak over each other on the debate stage. ""The vice president is ready to deal with Trump’s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button,"" Harris campaign senior communications adviser Brian Fallon said in a statement.  Trump, meanwhile, told reporters on Monday that he'd rather have the microphones on during the debate, but said it ""worked out fine"" when they were muted on stage with Mr Biden.  ""We agreed to the same rules and same specifications and I think that's probably what it should be, but they're trying to change it,"" he said. ""The truth is they're trying to get out of it because she doesn't want to debate. She's not a good debater."" Trump's campaign, in a statement to Politico, reiterated the former president's accusation that Ms Harris was looking to find a way to get out of the debate.  “Enough with the games. We accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate,""  senior Trump adviser Jason Miller told Politico.  ""The Harris camp, after having already agreed to the CNN rules, asked for a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements. We said no changes to the agreed upon rules.” A Harris campaign official who was asked about the Trump campaign's claims said they were ""100% false"", according to CBS News.  On Trump's Truth Social platform on Sunday, he questioned whether the ABC News journalists moderating the debate would give the questions to the Harris campaign ahead of time.  ""Why would I do the debate against Kamala Harris on that network?"" he wrote.  This is not the first time the former president has suggested he could back out of a debate. Earlier this month, Trump said he would only debate Ms Harris if the debate was hosted by Fox News. He reversed course several days later. Meanwhile, as the 5 November election nears, the Harris campaign said it has raised $540 million since Biden stepped down, the Associated Press reports. Harris saw record-breaking fundraising numbers in the aftermath of Mr Biden dropping out of the race.   The Trump campaign, on the other hand, raised $138.7 million in July and has $327 million cash on hand.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c935vljzd30o,Harris and Walz to sit for first interview of campaign,Vice-President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will be interviewed by CNN on Thursday in Georgia.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz - the Democratic ticket for US president - have agreed to their first joint interview. The two politicians will sit-down with CNN in Georgia for an interview that airs Thursday at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST).  It will be the candidates' first in-depth on-the-record conversation with a reporter since President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed Ms Harris as his replacement more than five weeks ago.  Since the vice-president moved to the top of the ticket, Republicans have criticised her for appearing to avoid the press and accused her of leaving voters in the dark on her presidential plans. The interview will be Ms Harris and Mr Walz's first big test as running mates, and it provides an opportunity for them to quiet that criticism. It also fufills a vow the vice-president made to schedule a sit-down before the end of the month.  It follows the pair's high-profile speeches at the star-studded Democratic National Convention in Chicago - a slickly produced and well-scripted party celebration - and Ms Harris will continue on to a bus tour of the battleground state of Georgia after the interview.   It will be one of the few opportunities for voters nationwide to hear more detail about the Harris-Walz campaign's policy positions before election day, which is only 70 days away.  Republicans - as well as members of the media - have grown louder about the campaign's few concrete policy positions or interviews during Ms Harris's truncated and unprecedented run for president.  It has opened her campaign up to chiding remarks and insults from her opponents.  Trump said during a recent press conference at Mar-a-Lago that Ms Harris ""can't do an interview"" because she was ""barely competent"".  Ohio Senator JD Vance, Trump's running mate, has scolded the media and Ms Harris for her press avoidance. He said earlier this month that it was ""shameful"" that Ms Harris had not ""taken a single real question from a reporter"". ""She (Harris) is taking a basement strategy of running from reporters instead of getting in front of them and answering tough questions about her record and letting the American people know who she is."" Mr Vance has frequently noted that both he and Trump have held multiple interviews and press conferences, often facing ""hostile questions"" from the press.  Vice-President Harris - who has enjoyed a campaign that has ridden high on ""good vibes"" thus far - has avoided some of the gaffes and blunders that the Republican ticket has suffered in front of the press, however. That could be the point, as she had a few bad experiences with the press in her first two years as vice-president.  A poor interview in 2021 with NBC's Lester Holt on immigration and the US southern border seemed to particularly have led to a limit of her press engagement thereafter.   It remains to be seen what effect this interview may have on Ms Harris's campaign, as multiple national opinion polls show her leading Trump ahead of the November presidential election.  A Farleigh Dickinson University poll released last week suggest Ms Harris is beating Trump nationally by seven points, 50 percent to 43 percent.  It is a stark reversal of fortunes for Democrats, who were beginning to fall behind Republicans in multiple races when Mr Biden was the nominee.  Polls frequently indicated the president trailing his predecessor by several points as well. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdpq4en1vvo,Trump faces revised 2020 election interference charges,The charges are in response to a Supreme Court ruling that presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US prosecutors have issued revised charges against Donald Trump for the former president's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2020 election after losing the contest. The updated wording tries to navigate a Supreme Court ruling that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. The ruling had thrown this case into doubt. Trump denies accusations that he pressured officials to reverse the results, knowingly spread lies about election fraud and sought to exploit a riot at the US Capitol to delay the certification of Joe Biden's victory. It appears unlikely the case - and other criminal cases he faces - will reach court before the next election on 5 November.  The revised indictment, brought by Department of Justice (DoJ) Special Counsel Jack Smith, leaves in place the four crimes Trump is accused of committing: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. But these now relate to Trump's status as a political candidate rather than a sitting president. Trump has previously pleaded not guilty to all charges. He wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform that the fresh indictment was ""an effort to resurrect a 'dead' Witch Hunt"" and ""distract the American People"" from this year's election. He called for it to be ""dismissed IMMEDIATELY"".  His campaign has not responded to a BBC request for comment. But a source close to his legal team told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the second indictment ""was not a surprise"".  ""This is what the government is supposed to do based on what the Supreme Court did,"" the source said. ""It doesn't change our position that we believe Smith's case is flawed and it should be dismissed."" The new charging document - which was slimmed down from 45 to 36 pages - re-works the language of the allegations to respond to last month's ruling on presidential immunity by the Supreme Court.  It argues Trump acted as a private citizen - and not as president - when he undertook the alleged scheme to sway the election. “The defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election,” reads one new line in the indictment. Another new line refers to a lawsuit filed by Trump's campaign in Georgia. The old language said the suit was “filed in his name”, but the updated indictment says it was “filed in his capacity as a candidate for president”. The new document also appears to have removed the charges against Jeffrey Clark - a former DoJ official who played a key role in the so-called fake electors scheme, according to prosecutors. Mr Clark was not named in either indictment, but has been identified in the media through public records. The fresh indictment also drops the claim that Trump tried to pressure DoJ officials to work to overturn his defeat. The high court ruled Trump's direction to justice officials was not illegal. The special counsel's office said the superseding indictment had been presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in the case. A grand jury is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution. The new indictment leaves in place several key allegations against Trump, including that he attempted to persuade Vice-President Mike Pence to obstruct Mr Biden’s election certification. That is despite the fact that conversations between Trump and Mr Pence would probably fall under the category of ""official"" acts, for which Trump has immunity from prosecution, according to the Supreme Court ruling.  The revised indictment showed that Mr Smith interpreted the Supreme Court ruling to mean that his case could still move forward, said Prof Daniel Richman, a constitutional law expert at Columbia Law School. But whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court's presidential immunity framework remained unclear, Prof Richman told the BBC. ""The court was painfully vague as to what private conduct done by a president can be charged criminally,"" he said. The revised indictment would not necessarily expedite the case, Prof Richman said. He doubted it would be heard before the 2024 election.  The CBS News source close to Trump's legal team said the former president's lawyers would ask for more time to prepare for the case. They said this would likely delay the start of the trial if the judge agreed.  This case came together after Mr Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into Trump: the election interference case and another case in which the ex-president has been accused of taking classified documents back to his Florida home after leaving office. On Monday, Mr Smith’s team appealed against the decision of a Florida judge to dismiss the latter case. Judge Aileen Cannon had done so on the grounds that the mere existence of special counsels violated the US Constitution. Mr Smith argued the judge's view ""deviated"" from legal precedent.  Both cases face uncertain futures after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision. The same is true of a separate case in Georgia, in which Trump and 18 other defendants are also accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has not been set. Meanwhile, Trump awaits sentencing after being convicted in New York in May of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to a porn star. If Trump defeats Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November, he is widely expected to order officials to drop all the remaining federal charges that he faces."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ejw1kd7ndo,Key takeaways from first Harris and Walz interview,"The vice-president and Democratic nominee tells CNN her ""values have not changed"" despite shifts on key issues.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has defended changing her mind on key issues in her first interview since entering the presidential race. The Democratic nominee was pressed on why her policies on immigration and climate have become more moderate since she ran for president in 2019. ""I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash. She also vowed to ""turn the page"" on the divisive rhetoric of the Trump era, in the joint interview with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Her Republican opponent Donald Trump described the interview as ""BORING!!!"" on Truth Social when it concluded, and described Ms Harris as a fraud. The vice-president was forced to defend the White House's economic track record, as inflation and high cost-of-living prices continue to hurt Americans.  When asked why she hadn't already implemented her ideas to tackle economic hardship she said they had done a lot of good work already but there was more to do. Polls suggest that voters would prefer Trump's handling of the economy. Here are the key takeaways from the interview.  Pressed on her move from liberal to more moderate policy positions, she said her values were consistent, pointing to her commitment to tackling climate change as an example. Asked about her reversal on banning fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock, she said she was confident US climate targets could be met without a ban. The main Republican line of attack has been to cast Ms Harris as an extremist, pointing to her 2019 statements as evidence. Back then, she also advocated for the closure of immigration detention centres and the decriminalisation of illegal crossings. She takes a stronger line on the border now, referring to her time ""prosecuting transnational, criminal organisations"" as California attorney general. Earlier this year, she supported a bipartisan border security bill that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for more wall construction. Trump pressured Republicans in Congress to kill the deal, which Ms Harris said in the CNN interview was a cynical political move.  Ms Harris also was asked about the war in Gaza, and re-iterated the White House's position that both Israel and Hamas must ""get a deal done"" and that the Palestinians deserve to have their own country neighbouring Israel. ""This war must end, and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out,"" she said. While emphasising the importance of a deal, she offered no specifics on how it would be achieved. She would not commit to an arms embargo on Israel, as some on her party's left flank have demanded. To explain her moderated immigration view, the Democratic nominee told CNN that her travels across the country as vice-president had made her believe in building consensus. Expanding on that, she said she would include a Republican in her presidential cabinet.  She said it would fulfill her promise to be a president “for all Americans”. ""I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views."" CNN's Dana Bash asked Ms Harris, born to immigrant parents from Jamaica and India, about recent comments by Trump in which he suggested she assumed a black identity in later life for political purposes. The comments caused an outrage but the vice-president had not weighed in. This time she gave a very short answer. ""Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please."" When asked later in the interview about the historic nature of her candidacy, she said she believed she was the best person to be president for for all Americans, regardless of race and gender.  Mr Walz was asked about misleading statements he has made about his military service and his personal struggle to have children. Ms Bash asked him to clarify a comment he made in which he said he ""carried"" an assault rifle in ""war"". The campaign has clarified that Mr Walz was never in a war zone.  The governor said he wore ""his emotions on his sleeve"" and was ""speaking passionately"" about the subject of gun crime in schools when he made the inaccurate statement. That ""passion"" also extended to his incorrect assertion that his wife had received in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments - which have become a political lightning rod in the US debate over abortion access - to conceive their children.  She received intrauterine insemination, not IVF. ""I spoke about our infertility issues ‘cause it’s hell, and families know this,"" he said on CNN. Ms Harris described the moment that President Biden called her to share that he had decided to end his re-election bid in July. She said her family was visiting her when she received the phone call. They had just eaten pancakes and bacon and were working on a puzzle.  ""My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you, my first thought was about him,"" Ms Harris said when asked whether she asked for his endorsement.  The vice-president also maintained that the president could have served again.  ""He is so smart, and I have spent hours upon hours with him being in the Oval Office and in the situation room. He has the intelligence, the commitment and judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president."" She said Trump, by contrast, had none of those qualities.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlr2z23ykno,Man surrenders and confesses to Germany stabbing attack,The man - reportedly wearing bloodstained clothes - turned himself in to Solingen police.,25 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"German authorities have identified the man who confessed to a mass knife attack as a suspected member of the Islamic State group (IS).  Prosecutors named the man as Issa Al H, omitting his surname because of Germany's privacy laws. The 26-year-old had given himself up and admitted to the stabbings, police said. Three people were killed and another eight injured during Friday's attack in the city of Solingen, during a festival to celebrate its 650-year history.  On Saturday, IS claimed that it was behind the attack. Chancellor Olaf Scholz had described it as an ""horrific act"". Those killed were two men aged 56 and 67, and a 56-year-old woman, officials said. Four of those wounded are still in a serious condition. All of the victims were stabbed in the neck, police said.  ""The man we’ve really been looking for the whole day has just been taken into custody,"" Herbert Reul, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, told ARD public TV late on Saturday. Germany's Bild and Spiegel news websites reported that the suspect surrendered himself in dirty blood-stained clothes. Issa Al H is under investigation for murder, attempted murder and ""strong suspicions of belonging to a terrorist group abroad"", the prosecutor's office said in a statement. He is a Syrian national, police and prosecutors confirmed, and German media reported that he arrived in the country in December 2022, after leaving war-torn Syria. Bild reported that special task force (SEK) officers stormed a refugee centre that the suspect was associated with, detaining another person there. Police also arrested a 15-year-old boy who is alleged to have known about the attack in advance. The refugee centre is located about 300m (984ft) from Fronhof - Solingen's central market square where the attack happened - according to Bild. Solingen - a city famous for its steel industry - has about 160,000 inhabitants. It lies about 25km (15 miles) east of Düsseldorf. The city's authorities asked people to leave the Fronhof area after the attack at about 22:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Friday. The planned three-day celebrations of the city anniversary - for which about 75,000 people had been expected - were cancelled. Solingen Mayor Tim Kurzbach later said that ""all of us in Solingen are in shock, horror and great sadness. ""It breaks my heart that an attack has happened in our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we've lost. ""I pray for all those still fighting for their lives. Also my greatest sympathy for all those who had to experience this, these images must have been horrific."" People have been bringing flowers and candles to the site of the stabbing that shocked the entire country. Players from Germany's top Bundesliga football league wore black armbands during Saturday's matches. The attack may fuel an already fraught debate about immigration and asylum in Germany. It comes ahead of key regional elections in the country’s east next week, where the far right is eyeing gains."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgedz9lrld8o,First Jan 6 rioter to enter Capitol building sentenced to prison,Michael Sparks jumped through a window and chased a police officer. He was given a term of more than four years.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The first rioter to enter the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 in an attempt to stop the official certification of the US presidential election has been sentenced to more than four years in prison. Michael Sparks, 47, was convicted of civil disorder, disorderly conduct and other related charges at trial in March. On Tuesday, US District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced him to 53 months in prison and a $2,000 (£1,500) fine. At his sentencing hearing, Sparks told the judge he still believes in false theories that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. “I am an American citizen who believes to this day that we are in tyranny,” he said, according to US media reports. “I am remorseful that what transpired that day didn’t help anybody,” he told the court. “I am remorseful that our country is in the state it’s in.” One charge of obstructing an official proceeding against Sparks was dropped after a Supreme Court decision which limited the use of the law against Capitol rioters. But on the other counts, Mr Kelly gave Sparks a stiffer sentence than guidelines suggested – less than two years – saying that Sparks did not fully realise the impact of his actions. The judge told him: “I don’t really think you appreciate the full gravity of what happened that day and, quite frankly, the full seriousness of what you did.” Sparks, wearing body armour, entered the Capitol through a smashed window and jumped to the floor shortly after 1400 local time on 6 January, after Donald Trump had addressed a nearby crowd in Washington DC. A US Capitol police officer testified at trial that he saw Sparks enter the building but chose not to draw his weapon and fire. Video from the Capitol showed that Sparks then joined a group that chased a Capitol Police officer up a flight of stairs, and shouted ""This is our America!"" He left the building about 10 minutes later. He was arrested a few weeks after the riot. Before traveling to Washington from his home in Cecilia, Kentucky, Sparks had written a number of messages online including ""We want a civil war to be clear"" and ""It's time to drag them out of Congress. It's tyranny"". He wrote: “TRUMP WILL BE YOUR PRESIDENT 4 more years in JESUS NAME. No need to reply to this just be ready for a lot of big events. Have radios for power loss etc. Love every body”. His lawyers had asked for one year of house arrest and argued that Sparks, despite entering the Capitol first, was not a ringleader of the movement, but instead got swept up in events. Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 57 months in prison. “One might say Sparks helped light the fire that day, using his preparation and planning - including his protective body armor - to steel himself against the officers attempting to hold back the mob,” the prosecution team wrote in a pre-sentencing memo. The investigation into the Capitol riot continues as authorities arrest and prosecute more participants. On Monday, a Utah man was arrested and charged with obstructing law enforcement, a felony, and a range of misdemeanour charges. Hal Ray Huddleston, 66, is accused of fighting with police and using a flagpole to push against police lines. Nearly 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the riot. Nearly 900 have pleaded guilty to various crimes, and more than 180 have been convicted at trial, according to the latest US justice department figures released earlier this month. Trump has promised to pardon some or all of the rioters, whom he has called ""hostages"" and ""political prisoners"", but has not given details about who he would release or the criteria he would use.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624qr3mqrzo,Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently,"Israeli extremists are working to make settlements in the West Bank irreversible, analysts fear.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In the Palestinian village of Battir, where ancient terraces are irrigated by a natural spring, life carries on as it has for centuries. Part of a Unesco World Heritage site, Battir is known for its olive groves and vineyards. But now it is the latest flashpoint over settlements in the occupied West Bank. Israel has approved a new Jewish settlement here, taking away privately owned land for new settler houses and new outposts have been set up without even Israeli authorisation. “They are stealing our land to build their dreams on our catastrophe,” says Ghassan Olyan, whose property is among that seized. Unesco says it is concerned by the settlers’ plans around Battir, but the village is far from an isolated example. All settlements are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees.  “They are not caring about the international law, or local law, and even God’s law,” Mr Olyan says. Last week, Israel’s domestic intelligence chief Ronen Bar wrote to ministers warning that Jewish extremists in the West Bank were carrying out acts of “terror” against Palestinians and causing “indescribable damage” to the country. Since the start of the war in Gaza, there has been an acceleration in settlement growth in the occupied West Bank. Extremists in Israel’s government boast that these changes will prevent an independent Palestinian state from ever being created. There are fears, too, that they seek to prolong the war in Gaza to suit their goals. Yonatan Mizrahi from Peace Now, an Israeli organisation that monitors settlement growth, believes a “mix of rage and fear” in Israeli society after the 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed, is driving settlers to seize more land, with fewer people questioning them. A June survey by the Pew Research Center suggested that 40% of Israelis believed settlements made the country safer, up from 27% in 2013. Meanwhile, 35% of people polled said that the settlements hurt Israel’s security, down from 42%. Mr Mizrahi worries that Jewish extremists in the West Bank are exacerbating an already tense and volatile situation, making it harder than ever to end the Israel-Palestinian conflict. “I think it’s extremely dangerous,” he says. “It’s increasing the hate on both sides.” Since the outbreak of the war, settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank has surged. It had already been on the rise, but in the past 10 months the UN has documented around 1,270 attacks, compared with 856 in all of 2022.  According to the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, during the same period Israeli settler harassment has forced Palestinians out of at least 18 villages in the West Bank, the Palestinian territory between Israel and Jordan that was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and has been occupied ever since. Between 7 October and August 2024, 589 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank – at least 570 by Israeli forces and at least 11 by settlers, according to the UN. They include some said to have been planning attacks as well as unarmed civilians. In the same period, Palestinians killed five settlers and nine members of Israel’s security forces. This week, a Palestinian man aged 40 was reportedly shot dead after settlers and Israeli soldiers entered Wadi al-Rahhel, near Bethlehem. The Israeli military said stones had previously been thrown at an Israeli vehicle nearby. Last month, a 22-year-old Palestinian man was killed when dozens of settlers rampaged through the village of Jit, prompting international condemnation. Israeli security forces have made four arrests and have described the incident as a “severe terror event”. But the track record in such cases is one of virtual impunity. Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din found that, between 2005 and 2023, just 3% of official investigations into settler violence ended in a conviction. In the letter by Ronen Bar, which was leaked to Israeli media, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service said that radical settlers were emboldened by light-handed law enforcement. Settlers live in exclusively Jewish communities set up in parts of the West Bank. Many settlements have the legal support of the Israeli government; others, known as outposts, and often as simple as caravans and corrugated iron sheds, are illegal even under Israeli law. But extremists build them regardless in a bid to seize more land. In July, when the UN’s top court found for the first time that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was illegal, it said the country should halt all settlement activity and withdraw as soon as possible.  Israel’s Western allies have repeatedly described settlements as an obstacle to peace. Israel rejected the finding, saying: “The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land.” Now there are fears that extremists are working to make settlements in the West Bank irreversible. They have rapidly expanded their control over the territory, with the support of the most far-right government in Israel’s history. These extremists are advancing annexation plans in the West Bank and also openly call for settling Gaza once the war is over. Settlers now serve at the heart of Israel’s government, in key ministries. At the very time that world leaders opposed to settlements are voicing renewed enthusiasm for a two-state solution - a long-hoped for peace plan that would create a separate Palestinian state - Israeli religious nationalists, who believe all these lands rightfully belong to Israel, are vowing to make the dream of an independent Palestinian state impossible. Analysts think this is why some politicians are refusing to accept any ceasefire deal. “The reason they don’t want to end the conflict or go into a hostage deal is because they believe that Israel should keep on fighting until it can reach a point where it can stay inside Gaza,” says Tal Schneider, political correspondent for The Times of Israel. “They think for the long term their ideology is more righteous,” she adds. “This is their own logic.” Israeli authorities, meanwhile, have announced plans for five new settlements, including the one in Battir, and declared a record area of land, at least 23 sq km, for the state. This means Israel considers it Israeli land, regardless of whether it is in the occupied Palestinian territories, or privately owned by Palestinians, or both, and Palestinians are prevented from using it. By changing facts on the ground, as the settlers describe it, they hope to move enough Israelis on to the land and build enough on it to make their presence irreversible. Their long-term hope is that Israel formally annexes the land. Outside state-sanctioned land seizures, extremists have also rapidly established settlement outposts.  In one by al-Qanoub, north of Hebron, satellite images showed new caravans and roads had appeared in the months since the start of the war. Meanwhile, an entire Palestinian community has been forced off the land. We drove to al-Qanoub with Ibrahim Shalalda, 50, and his 80-year-old uncle Mohammed, who told us their homes had been destroyed by settlers last November. As we approached, an extremist settler blocked the road with his car. Armed Israelis soon arrived. The group – some Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers, with insignia on their uniforms and one identified as a settlement security officer – stopped us for checks. The settlement guard forced the two Palestinian farmers from the car and searched them. After two hours, the IDF soldiers dispersed the settlers and allowed the BBC car to leave. Israel began settling the West Bank soon after capturing it from Jordan and occupying it more than five decades ago. Successive governments since then have allowed creeping settlement expansion. Today, an estimated three million Palestinians live on the land - excluding Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem - alongside about half a million Jewish Israelis in more than 130 settlements. But a prominent far-right government figure who took office in 2022 is promising to double the number of settlers to a million. Bezalel Smotrich believes that Jews have a God-given right to these lands. He heads one of two far-right, pro-settler parties that veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought into his governing coalition after the 2022 elections returned him to power. Mr Smotrich serves as finance minister but also has a post in the defence ministry, which has allowed him to make sweeping changes to Israeli policies in the West Bank. He has massively invested state finances in settlements, including new roads and infrastructure. But he has also created a new bureaucracy, taking powers from the military, to fast-track settler construction.  In secretly recorded remarks to supporters, Mr Smotrich boasted that he was working towards “changing the DNA” of the system and for de facto annexation that would be “easier to swallow in the international and legal context”. Religious nationalists have sat on the fringes of Israeli politics for decades. But their ideology has slowly become more popular. In the 2022 election, these parties took 13 seats in the 120-seat Israeli parliament and became kingmakers in Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition. During the war, Bezalel Smotrich and fellow radical Itamar Ben-Gvir, now Israel’s national security minister, have repeatedly made comments stoking social division and provoking Israel’s Western allies. After Israel’s military arrested reservists accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee, Mr Ben Gvir said it was “shameful” for Israel to arrest “our best heroes”. This month, Mr Smotrich suggested it might be “justified and moral” to starve Gazans. But it is in the West Bank and Gaza that the far right seeks to make permanent changes. “This is a group of Israelis who have been against any type of compromise with the Palestinians or Israel's other Arab neighbours,” says Anshel Pfeffer, a veteran Israeli journalist and correspondent for The Economist.  And with the war in Gaza, the far right sees a fresh opportunity. Mr Smotrich has called for Palestinian residents to leave, making way for Israelis who could “make the desert bloom”. Although Mr Netanyahu has ruled out restoring Jewish settlements in Gaza, he remains beholden to far-right parties who threaten to collapse his coalition if he signs a “reckless” ceasefire deal to bring home Israeli hostages currently held by Hamas. The logic of the extremists may be one that only a minority of Israelis follow. But it is helping to prolong the war, and dramatically transforming the landscape of the West Bank - causing long-term damage to chances of peace.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d9rj33x1no,RFK Jr just endorsed Trump. Will it matter in November?,"The former Democrat has been slumping in the polls, but some of his remaining support may swing behind the Republican.",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The independent campaign of Robert F Kennedy Jr is over, but the question that has followed him on the campaign trail remains – does his support come mostly from those who would otherwise vote Republican or Democrat? His base was small and shrinking. An average of opinion polls by the website RealClearPolitics puts him on 5%, down from the high teens just a few months ago. But in a closely fought election, Kennedy voters could swing victory either way for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in November's election. Much of the slump in Mr Kennedy's numbers, experts say, is down to excitement among Democrats over their new candidate, Vice-President Harris. “When it was Biden versus Trump people were looking for a third option,” said Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation who has studied the history of third-party campaigns. “But with Kamala Harris coming into the picture and gaining the Democratic nomination, that has changed.” Opinion polls that reflect independent and third-party candidates – including the Green Party’s Jill Stein and left-wing activist Cornel West – have been inconclusive about where Mr Kennedy’s support is coming from.  In some cases they show his presence in the race benefiting Republicans; in others Democrats; and in nearly every such poll, the margins are slim. But observers believe that a significant chunk of Mr Kennedy’s liberal-leaning support may have already been drawn back to the Democratic party by Ms Harris’s rise. Mr Matthews said the suspension of RFK Jr’s campaign means Trump will get a “little bit of a bounce”. “But I’m not sure it will be very much, as Kennedy was dropping pretty significantly in the polls,” he said. Still, a few votes in battleground states might be enough to swing an election that appears very close at the moment. Mr Kennedy is keenly aware of this, announcing on Friday that he would only be deleting his name from the ballot in swing states where he believes his presence would hurt Trump’s campaign. Although he’s a member of the country’s most famous Democratic family, Mr Kennedy spent most of his drop-out speech criticising the party. He also spent much of his campaign butting heads with the Democratic establishment. At a fundraiser this spring in suburban Detroit – a key battleground in the crucial swing state of Michigan – protesters from the local Democratic party stood outside holding signs calling him a spoiler. His decision to throw his support behind Trump will vindicate those allegations in the minds of Kennedy critics. “I think some of his voters will vote for Trump, and there are others who won’t be satisfied with either candidate and who just won’t vote,” said Melissa Smith, author of Third Parties, Outsiders, and Renegades: Modern Challenges to the Two-Party System in Presidential Elections. But Mr Kennedy’s campaign, struggling for cash, might have had more impact on the race if he had stayed in, or dropped out at the last minute. With more than two months to go until election day, Ms Smith predicted that his run would be a “blip in history”, which could quickly become old news in an election contest that has already thrown up lots of surprises. For now, however, Trump appears better placed to capture more of what’s left of Mr Kennedy’s support. The Trump campaign released a memo from its pollster Tony Fabrizio, stating that Republicans stand to gain. “This is good news for President Trump and his campaign – plain and simple,” he wrote. But his endorsement also poses some risk for Trump, as Democrats seek to define the Republican ticket as “weird” – by which they mean outside the mainstream of American politics. Mr Kennedy, with his fringe anti-vaccination views, could end up providing more material for such attacks. Outside this week’s Democratic National Convention, a tongue-in-cheek newspaper stating that it was funded by his campaign boasted the headline “Kennedy is weird”. Chock-full of anti-vaccine messages and references to conspiracy theories, its underlying message was that “weird” is good. The Harris campaign, meanwhile, did not directly refer to RFK Jr in a statement responding to the news on Friday. “For any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you,” said Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon."

The 79-year-old was Eritrea's longest serving minister of finance, but he was removed from his role in 2012 following clashes with President Isaias Afwerki. Six years later, he was jailed after releasing a book where he described the president as a ""dictator"" who needed to resign. His family told the BBC that the authorities, who rarely confirm the deaths of senior officials in custody, had notified them of Mr Berhane's death. The government also rarely shares where the bodies are buried but Mr Berhane's family have heard there is a plan to bury him in Asmara Patriots Cemetery. Only veterans of the Eritrean independence war, like Mr Berhane, or members of the national service can be buried there. His body has not yet been released, his family said, and it is not clear when and exactly how Mr Berhane died. He was never brought before a court of law. President Isaias has ruled the East African country, without holding national elections, since winning the independence war against Ethiopia in 1991. Political parties, civic organisation and independent media are all banned. The UN and human rights groups have long accused the Eritrean government of gross human rights violations, including torture, forced disappearance and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in inhumane conditions. Mr Berhane's fall-out with President Isaias began during the former's 12-year tenure as finance minister, in which he urged Mr Isaias for transparency on the country's budget. The budget is still inaccessible to the public today. In 2012, Mr Berhane was removed from his post and sidelined from politics. Three years later he secretly wrote a two-volume book named My Country, and sent it abroad to be published. Alongside calling his old boss a dictator and demanding he resign, Mr Berhane used the book to challenge Mr Isaias to a debate on national television. He also called for the reinstatement of the national assembly -  Eritrea's parliament - which had been dissolved by the president in 2002. To this day, there is still no legislative body to hold the government accountable. In 2018, after Mr Berhane had published My Country, he was detained and imprisoned in an unknown location. By this time his wife was already in prison, although no reason was given. She was released in 2019. One of Mr Berhane's sons, who was also detained during the same period as his mother, previously described his family's ordeal to the BBC. “I am living with a dim glimmer of hope that my father who has health issues [will be out of prison one day],” Efrem Berhane said in 2020. The 31-year-old, who lives in the US after fleeing Eritrea, asked: “How can people be kidnapped by a government and disappear for years? Why do people show such cruelty on a fellow human like this?"" But some people have been imprisoned for even longer. In September 2001, 11 senior ministers and generals who were part of a group known as the “G-15” were arrested after they criticised the president. The collective - which included three former foreign ministers, an education minister and a former armed forces chief of staff - have not been seen since. In Eritrea, political prisoners are often prohibited from contact with the outside world. In February, Ilze Brands-Kehris, United Nations Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights said ""impunity persists"" for human rights violations in Eritrea. ""Our office continues to receive credible reports of torture; arbitrary detention; inhumane conditions of detention; enforced disappearances; restrictions of the rights to freedoms of expression, of association, and of peaceful assembly,"" she said. Born in Eritrea in 1945, Mr Berhane earned an MA degree in economics from a US university before joining the struggle for independence from Ethiopia. He is the father of four children.

The FBI and other federal agencies said in a joint statement that Iran had chosen to interfere in the US election ""to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions"".  The Trump campaign pointed the finger at Iran on 10 August for hacking its internal messages. Iranian officials denied it.  Sources familiar with the investigation told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that they suspect Iranian hackers also targeted the campaign of Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris.  “The [intelligence community] is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties,” US intelligence officials said in the statement.  ""Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process."" The Trump campaign was reportedly sent a spear-phishing email – a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link.  The Harris campaign said last week it had also been the target of a spear-phishing attack, though it was unsuccessful. The agencies that released Monday's statement, including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the tactics were ""not new"" and noted that Russia and Iran had employed such methods during previous US elections.  It remains unclear what information, if any, was stolen during the hack. Trump said the hackers were only able to obtain publicly available information.  The New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including on its vetting of his running mate, JD Vance. The outlets have so far declined to offer specifics.  US officials said it was clear Iran wanted to shape the outcome of elections it believes are ""particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests"".  The American intelligence agencies added that they had ""observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle"". There has been growing concern about potential Iranian hackers. Recently, Microsoft said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran.  Before he dropped out of the White House race last month, President Joe Biden's campaign was targeted by Iranian hackers, as was Trump's, according to Google. "

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4ydqv8721o,Jobs report revisions stoke politics around US economy,The US says jobs growth was weaker than previously estimated. So how worried should we be?,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Jobs growth in the US appears to have been weaker than previously understood last year, the Labor Department said Wednesday, an update that enflamed an already heated debate about the state of the US economy.  The Labor Department said its latest data suggested employers added about 818,000 fewer jobs than previously estimated over the 12 months prior to March. The revision, which is preliminary, would reduce the total number of jobs created during that time by about 30%, compared with previous estimates - the biggest such update since 2009. In an ordinary year, the publication of a new estimate would be marked by only the nerdiest of economic forecasters. But months before a presidential election, it quickly became political fodder. The new estimates suggest monthly job growth of about 174,000, instead of the roughly 240,000 previously understood.  Most sectors were hit by downward revisions, including information - media and tech among other areas - retail, manufacturing, and the grab-bag category of ""professional and business services.  That means job growth in the period was ""even more dependent on government and education/healthcare than thought"", wrote Ryan Sweet at Oxford Economics. Hiring was ""still strong but less than that needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population"" he noted.  At the end of the day, the revisions imply that the total number of jobs in the US is just 0.5% smaller than previously thought. The Labor Department publishes estimates of job creation each month, based on surveys it sends out to employers. It regularly revises the figures as it gets more information, with a final reset at the start of each year. Its report Wednesday was a preview of that update, incorporating county-level unemployment insurance tax data.  This revision was ""notably"" larger than previous years, Mr Sweet noted.  But some analysts suggested it might be overblown, noting that the tax data would not reflect jobs going to unauthorized workers.  Given the recent surge in immigration in the US, they say that could lead to jobs growth being undercounted. Over the last four years, the final estimates of job growth have ended up higher than indicated in August. Strong jobs growth has been key to the Biden administration's case that its policies helped the US emerge from the pandemic with the strongest economy in the world.  But on Wednesday, Republicans seized on the figures to argue that Democrats have been gaslighting voters about the state of the economy.  The Republican Party responded on social media writing: ""BREAKING: 818,000 jobs that the Harris-Biden administration claimed to have “created” aren’t actually there"". Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a ""MASSIVE SCANDAL!"" claiming that the ""real"" numbers were ""much worse than that"". But Jared Bernstein, the chair of President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said the revision, ""doesn’t change the fact that this has been and remains a strong jobs recovery, powering real wage gains, solid consumer spending, and record small biz creation"". For much of the last year, the US has reported strong jobs growth in defiance of economist expectations - and public sentiment. The gains have surprised many because businesses and households are facing the highest borrowing costs in a generation, which would ordinarily trip-up growth.   As the Republican response underlined, the revisions bolster arguments that the labour market is on shakier ground than understood. Many analysts said the new numbers would strengthen the case for the US central bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting in November. That is already expected, as it tries to head off further weakening in the job market.  But the change didn't set off widespread alarms. Financial markets, which were roiled by jitters about the economy earlier this month, took the latest data largely in stride, noting that they were in line with expectations.  ""Non-farm payroll growth from April 2023 to March 2024 looks to be softer than first thought, but not worryingly so,"" wrote Olivia Cross, North America economist at Capital Economics. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn6p67p0jo,Secret Service agents put on leave over Trump shooting,"At least five agents, including head of Pittsburgh field office and member of Trump's detail, placed on administrative leave.",23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"At least five US Secret Service agents have been placed on administrative leave following the attempt on Donald Trump's life in Pennsylvania, US media reports.  They include the head of the the Pittsburgh field office that coordinated security with local police, three other agents in the same office and a member of Trump's personal detail, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, was injured in the right ear by a bullet fired from a roof by Thomas Crooks, 20, at a rally in Butler on 13 July.  His burst of gunfire killed one crowd member and injured two others before he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper. Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said its review of ""this operational failure"" was ongoing, adding that agents were held to ""the highest professional standards"" and any violations could result in disciplinary action.  Kimberly Cheatle resigned as the service's director shortly after facing members of Congress in a contentious hearing where she failed to provide specific answers about the attack and her agents' response.  She has since been replaced by Ronald Rowe as acting director.  The House of Representatives has formed a task force to investigate the operational failures that allowed Crooks to fire on the crowd.  Trump held an outdoor rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, his first since the assassination attempt. His podium surrounded by bulletproof glass.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly31l97x0wo,No foreign holidays for Gabon government officials,"The interim president says he wants to ""immerse"" politicians in the realities of ordinary people.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Gabon's interim president who seized power in a coup a year ago has barred members of his transitional government from holidaying abroad. Gen Oligui Nguema has also limited government officials to a maximum of one week of holiday leave. These new restrictions were announced on state television, after he toured the country to listen to people's concerns. There is speculation that Gen Nguema may be softening the ground to run for president in next year's election - the first since he seized power in the Central African state. He overthrew his cousin Ali Bongo, who became president in 2009 following the death of his father, Omar Bongo Ondimba, who had ruled for 41 years. Since Gen Nguema took power, he has sought to reassure the public that his military government is acting in their best interest. However, he has not publicly commented on whether or not he will run for the country’s top job in polls that are planned for 2025. News of the holiday restrictions comes days before the first anniversary of the coup - when the junta's record will inevitably be scrutinised. Gen Nguema may be hoping to draw favourable comparisons with the man he overthrew, Mr Bongo, who was known to travel overseas regularly and whose family owned multiple properties in France and the UK. Yet Gen Nguema is himself said to own multiple properties in the US, and when asked about these in recent years he has said that his private life should be respected. Nonetheless it is thought the new holiday restrictions will apply to Gen Nguema too. But he will no doubt be entitled to go abroad for official purposes. Details of the new holiday rules were read out on state television, with viewers told that the goal was to ""immerse"" government officials ""in the realities and expectations of their compatriots"". A spokesman for the interim government explained that ""this measure aims to encourage a return to the roots and increased proximity with local populations"", stipulating that exceptions will only be made in cases of ""force majeure"" - a legal term meaning extraordinary events that are out of parties' control - or on health grounds. Gabonese officials need not despair, given the array of attractions in their home country - including stunning white sand beaches and some of the world's best gorilla safaris in Loango National Park.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce317d27l7zo,Hillary Clinton says it's time for Kamala Harris to break 'glass ceiling',Women in politics say much has changed since Ms Clinton ran for office in 2016 - but is it enough?,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Hillary Clinton has spoken at the Democratic National Convention of her hope that Kamala Harris can finally break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in America by becoming the first female president. Ms Clinton said she had broken a glass ceiling of her own by becoming the first woman to win a major party nomination for president. “When a barrier falls for one of us, it clears the way for all of us,” she said, echoing her convention speech from eight years before. But while her bid for the presidency in 2016 was historic, it ultimately ended in defeat when she lost the election to Donald Trump. Now, as the Democratic Party takes its next shot at putting the first woman in the White House, she told a crowd of thousands in Chicago the time had come to pass the torch.  “Together, we’ve put a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling,” Mrs Clinton said. “On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th President of the United States.” Times have changed since Mrs Clinton's presidential bid, according to several female delegates and politicians attending the 2024 DNC in Chicago.  Back then, she made her gender a central part of the campaign - a move Ms Harris has seemingly chosen to avoid. Whether the political backdrop has transformed enough for the vice-president to reach the nation’s highest office remains an open question. Mrs Clinton “shattered a lot of glass for many people”, Minyon Moore, the chair of the Democratic National Convention Committee, told reporters on Monday morning. But, she added: “It’s not easy. We’re trying to shift the mindset of people.” Women politicians and delegates who spoke to the BBC said they faced a number of barriers in politics, both in running for office and while serving their communities. When Mallory McMorrow, a state senator from Michigan, ran for office in 2018, she remembers one woman in her district asked if she was planning on having children. “She told me to my face, this is not a job for a mom,” Ms McMorrow said. She went on to become the second senator in Michigan history to give birth while in office. Judy Mount, the first African-American female chair of the Florida Democrats, said it took years for women to be able to serve as chairs of their state political parties. “People just do not want to see a woman in charge of anything,” she said. “They do not.” During her run for president in 2016, Mrs Clinton faced a barrage of criticisms over her appearance, her clothing and even the sound of her voice. She came into the race with more “baggage” than the average candidate, said Deloris Hudson, an Ohio delegate at the DNC. Voters judged Mrs Clinton not only based on her own credentials and record as a  senator and US secretary of state but also on her relationship with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, Ms Hudson said. Ms Hudson believes many women judged Mrs Clinton for staying with her husband after he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, an intern in the White House. Mrs Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016 was also a catalyst for change. It sparked women’s marches across the country and propelled a record number of female candidates to run for office in 2018. Now, 28.5% of the House of Representatives is female, compared to just 19.1% in 2017, according to the Pew Research Center. Meanwhile, over the past decade, the percentage of Americans who believe men are better suited for politics than women fell continuously, according to data from the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center. Several elections later, Ms Harris does not face the same pressure as Mrs Clinton to be “everything to every woman”, Ms McMorrow said. “Since then, we've seen more women running and winning at every single level all the way up that allows us more freedom and flexibility to be ourselves,” she said. Though the vice-president’s aides and allies have pointed to deep-rooted sexism she’s faced over her career, Ms Harris has tried to focus on her record rather than her gender identity. While Mrs Clinton tried to galvanise voters around her female candidacy, coining the slogan “I’m with Her”, Ms Harris has largely avoided conversations about gender. The move is perhaps both intentional and natural, Ms McMorrow said. “There are so many more of us [women politicians] that I don't think you have to mention it anymore,” she said. Instead, this conversation has largely been left up to her supporters, including women and voters of colour who have helped raise millions of dollars for Ms Harris. They have painted the 59-year-old as a younger, fresh alternative to the 78-year-old Trump, and a candidate who has given the Democratic ticket some much-needed momentum with two and a half months until November's election. For some Democrats like US congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan, Ms Harris’s ascension to the top of the ticket is representative of the progress women have made in politics in recent years. But, she added, there remains more work to be done. “We need to make sure that we include everybody, that no demographic feels left behind because someone else succeeds,” Ms Dingell said. “As a country, I think that's something we've got to continue to work at.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86l4p583y6o,Arizona man accused of posting threats to Trump is arrested,"The 66-year-old suspect was taken into custody without incident, police said, after social media posts targeting the ex-president.",23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Police have captured an Arizona man who allegedly threatened to kill Donald Trump following a manhunt that unfolded as the former president was visiting the border state. Police say Ronald Lee Syvrud, 66, of Cochise County, made death threats against Trump in social media posts over the past fortnight. Trump was in Cochise County on Thursday visiting the US frontier with Mexico. Last month Trump was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Cochise County Sheriff’s Office says Syrvud is also wanted for failing to register as a sex offender. He faces several warrants in both Wisconsin and Arizona, including on charges of driving under the influence and a felony hit and run. Police say he is from Benson, Arizona, which is located about 50 miles (80km) south-east of Tucson. The Cochise County Sheriff's Office posted on Thursday afternoon that they had caught the suspect within the county lines. ""This subject has been taken into custody without incident,"" the office posted. Trump spent Thursday in Cochise County, visiting the US-Mexico border. During his remarks, he sought to blame his rival, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, for allowing illegal immigrants into the US. Reporters asked him if he was aware of the search for the Cochise County suspect. ""No, I have not heard that, but I am not that surprised and the reason is because I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys,"" Trump said. This isn't the first threat against a presidential candidate this election cycle. Earlier this month, a 66-year-old Virginia man was arrested on suspicion of making death threats against Vice-President Harris, among other public officials."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdlnzegz8o,New council leader warns of bankruptcy threat,Council leader Tony Dyer has revealed that the authority presently faces an overspend of £22m.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The first ever Green leader of Bristol has warned that the city council is at risk of going bankrupt unless urgent action is taken. Councillor Tony Dyer has revealed that the authority presently faces an overspend of £22m. A savings programme is being developed, with warnings that some charges will also rise. But there is already criticism from campaigners, with accusations that the Greens have rowed back on earlier pledges. In May’s local elections the Greens won the most seats, though without an overall majority. They were delighted, but three months later the mood is very different. Money was already tight, but extra costs have come to light, and planned savings have fallen short. “The financial situation is very challenging,” said Mr Dyer. That has led to a warning that Bristol could end up issuing a Section 114 notice – effectively going bankrupt. “I think without government intervention I can’t guarantee that won’t happen, but having said that, I think we are now taking the measures and putting into place the processes that we need to do,"" said Mr Dyer. They will try to improve efficiency, there could be cuts, and charges may rise, including the rent paid by allotment holders. Nearly doubling charges had been proposed by the previous administration – but the Greens objected and got it put on hold. Now it is set to go ahead, to the anger of those with allotments. Sally Wyatt, who has tended to her plot at Bedminster Down for seven years, said: “I’m really disappointed, because I think they’re an invaluable place. “They should be cheap, they should be affordable, they should be accessible to everybody."" The Greens are also under pressure over another cause they championed. Last year, the Labour administration set about expanding South Bristol Cemetery onto council-owned fields currently leased to a farm. Churning up land designated a Site of Nature Conservation Interest sparked widespread opposition – especially from the Greens. The plans are presently on hold – but could get the go-ahead from councillors in October. “I’m worried and concerned,” said Catherine Withers who has lived at Yew Tree Farm all her life. “If the plans went through as they are I’d be devastated, beyond devastated, and I think that the Greens would never get elected again.” The leader of Bristol City Council concedes difficult decisions lie ahead and cautions that without a majority, the Greens can be outvoted. “Nobody became a councillor because they wanted to put up allotment fees, or build on Sites of Nature Conservation Interest, or a host of other things,” said Mr Dyer. “But the reality is we have to work within the constraints that are placed upon us.” He is confident they can avoid going bust this year but he is unsure about future years.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzjzj989zo,Hulk Hogan jokes about body slamming Kamala Harris,"The former wrestler, who supports Donald Trump, also made comments about the vice-president's racial identity.",21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has joked about body slamming Vice-President Kamala Harris in front of a fired up crowd, and questioned her racial identity. In a video obtained by TMZ, the 71-year-old can be seen asking the jeering crowd: ""Do you want me to body slam Kamala Harris?!"" ""Do you want me to drop the leg on Kamala?!"" he shouts, referring to one of his iconic wrestling moves. The comments were made during a promotional event for his new beer, and come amid calls to stop violent political rhetoric, following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump nearly six weeks ago. Hogan continued to make more comments about Ms Harris including one about her Indian heritage. Kamala Harris is bi-racial - her mother was from India and her father is Jamaican.  ""Is Kamala a chameleon? Is she Indian?"" Hogan asked the crowd, before using an outdated and stereotypical greeting associated with Native American Indians.  The video stops after he could be heard saying he ""was going to get heat for that one"". ""That was not me, that was the beer talking,"" he added. The BBC has contacted Hulk Hogan's management for comment. Trump recently attacked the vice-president's racial identity, falsely claiming she had only ever emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". Last month, Hulk Hogan appeared at the Republican National Convention where he gave a speech praising Trump. He also ripped off a shirt to reveal a vest with Trump's name and his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance. The former wrestler's latest comments come as the Democrats are holding their party's convention this week in Chicago, where they will formally endorse Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate for November's election.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77l612r254o,South Africa opposition in turmoil as Malema's deputy jumps ship,South Africa's radical opposition politician Julius Malema suffers a big blow as his deputy ditches him.,24 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A major player on South Africa's political landscape for more than a decade, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has been shaken to the core following the defection of its deputy leader Floyd Shivambu to former President Jacob Zuma's fledgling party - uMhkonto weSizwe (MK), or Spear of the Nation.  Mr Shivambu was seen as the EFF's ideological guru, while party leader Julius Malema assumed the mantle of commander-in-chief - or ""screamer-in-chief"", as his critics dubbed him - with his fiery rhetoric demanding the nationalisation of white-owned land and mines, and the ""decolonisation"" of education. The duo seemed to be a winning team, with the EFF gaining the support of South Africa's burgeoning youth population frustrated with the slow pace of political and economic reforms since the end of the racist system of apartheid in 1994.  But the EFF suffered a major setback in the May general election when, instead of achieving its goal of rising from the country's third biggest party to second, it dropped to fourth. MK proved to be its political nemesis - just as it was for the governing African National Congress (ANC) - by gaining votes from both parties to snatch third place in the first election it contested.  ""MK cannibalised the ANC and took votes from the EFF. It changed the course of South African politics, making the ANC lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since 1994,"" William Gumede, an academic with Wits University's School of Governance in Johannesburg, told the BBC. Mr Shivambu read the political tea leaves and defected to the MK last week, causing the biggest rupture in the EFF since its launch 11 years ago.  For Mr Malema, it was a personal blow because the two, as young men oozing with political energy, had jointly launched the EFF after the ANC - ironically then led by Mr Zuma - expelled them. They had challenged the authority of a president who was steeped in traditional values of respect for elders, and were kicked out after accusations of being divisive and bringing the party into disrepute.  ""The EFF took with it almost the entire youth wing of the ANC, and also came to dominate student politics at campuses across South Africa, such was the party's appeal amongst young people,"" said Paddy Harper, a journalist with South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper.  ""Malema had the charisma to get support, and Shivambu the brains to give it ideological direction,"" he told the BBC. ""With their break-up, the EFF will enter a period of turmoil. This will be felt across South Africa, from campuses to parliament as the EFF tries to prevent losing more support to MK.""  However, political analyst Moeletsi Mbeki said the break-up would actually ""strengthen"" Mr Malema's position in the EFF as he no longer faced a ""potential threat"" to his power.  ""The EFF is considered as more of a cult, run by Malema. In such a system, the leader is the leader. Full stop. Anyone who appears to be close to the leader eventually becomes a casualty,"" he told the BBC.  The first public sign of the relationship running into trouble came last year, when Mr Malema paid a glowing tribute to Mr Shivambu, describing him as a thinker, before warning him not to plot against him. ""I’m ruthless against people who do such things to me, so never try that with me,” Mr Malema was quoted as saying at a gala dinner.  With Mr Malema set to run for re-election as party leader at the EFF's conference in October, Mr Shivambu, 41, appeared to have decided that it was time to move on. MK has made him its national organiser - a demotion from his role in the EFF but still a senior post with the responsibility of growing the party. But, Mr Harper said, it was unclear how he would get along with Mr Zuma, given their previous fall-out and the fact that the former president was also a cult-like figure in MK who repeatedly appoints and sacks officials. In less than a year the party has had three secretary generals. ""But there is also the view that the party is still finding its feet, and will stabilise with its core leadership including Zuma, John Hlophe, the impeached judge who has been made his deputy, and Shivambu,"" Mr Harper said.  Another reason which could have pushed Mr Shivambu to defect is that he and Mr Malema - despite their public personae of being socialists and African nationalists - were at the centre of a major corruption scandal, he added. They have been accused of receiving about 16m rand ($900,000; £700,000) in ""gratification"" - bribes, in simple language - from the boss of a now-liquidated bank after meeting him at a penthouse in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg in 2017. The allegation was made in a recently leaked witness statement by the bank's disgraced boss, Tshifhiwa Matodzi, after he pleaded guilty to 33 counts of corruption, theft, fraud, money laundering and racketeering for being involved in what investigators described as a ""bank heist"". Both Mr Shivambu and Mr Malema have denied any wrongdoing, but with a police investigation under way -  and their political rivals likely to keep up the pressure - the scandal will not go away anytime soon.  ""It is the biggest corruption scandal to hit the EFF, and if the party had to turn anyone into a sacrificial lamb it would have been Shivambu - certainly not Malema,"" Mr Harper said. ""So, his move to MK makes sense as it offers him more protection. It is a bigger party full of people accused of corruption - including Mr Zuma himself."" The former president has denied any wrongdoing. MK was also a natural political home for Mr Shivambu as its economic policy is similar to the EFF's - both advocating the expropriation of white-owned land and the state ownership of mines and banks - policies that were adopted by many African states after their independence but which were abandoned around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union more than 20 years ago.  ""MK and EFF represent the old nationalist politics of Africa. They are totally out of touch,"" Mr Mbeki said. ""State-owned companies in South Africa are huge, but they are collapsing because of mismanagement. For the working class, it means a loss of jobs,"" he added.  Expressing a similar view, Prof Gumede said the EFF had failed to gain a foothold in South Africa's trade union movement despite being in existence for more than 10 years.  ""Whether working class or middle class, older voters see the EFF as standing for chaos and confrontation. They want parties to co-operate to solve South Africa's problems because we have an electricity and water crisis, and high unemployment and crime,"" Prof Gumede said.  This was the clear message from the election, he added, but both the EFF and MK had made a ""strategic mistake"" by failing to join the government of national unity that President Cyril Ramaphosa formed after the election. Mr Harper said that since the general election, MK had done badly in by-elections held in Mr Zuma's political backyard of KwaZulu-Natal.  ""It is not in government, and all it has been doing is oppose the coalition government in the province. That is not what voters want. They want delivery of basic services,"" he said. ""As for the EFF, the ANC is currently in the process of dumping it as its coalition partner in cities such as Johannesburg. So it, too, is out in the cold.  ""Logically, the EFF and MP should be strengthening relations to offer voters a viable alternative, rather than competing against each other for members and voters,"" Mr Harper added.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl21j2py8xo,Democrats are riding high but victory is far from certain,"After a jubilant party convention capped a month of momentum, polls still suggest a close election.",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris strode out onto the Democratic convention stage on Thursday night and told Americans they had a “precious, fleeting opportunity” in front of them – to back her candidacy and consign the extraordinary period since Donald Trump entered the political arena nine years ago to history. Her 40-minute speech was not exactly the soaring oratory that the Obamas delivered earlier in the week, but the euphoria and confidence in the arena was palpable. With high-power celebrity endorsements and a widespread sense among Democrats that they are embarking on a new chapter, the party faithful have not been this excited since Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008. The jubilant atmosphere among delegates in Chicago is down to both relief that they don’t have to go into this election with Joe Biden, a candidate whose advanced age was a major liability, and delight at how seamlessly Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have assumed their places at the top of the ticket. But behind the scenes, party strategists are worried about Democratic voters and activists – who will need to turn out, knock on doors and convince their friends and family to head to a ballot box on 5 November – getting carried away. Opinion polls have moved in their direction in the weeks since President Biden stepped aside but this is still a very tight race. It will be won, too, in a handful of states – Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. In nearly all of those places, it seems either candidate could feasibly win. And if the past six weeks are any guide, the political dynamics could change quickly again in the 70 or so days left. Jim Messina, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, told the BBC’s Americast podcast that any certainty Democrats are on course for victory is misplaced. “Kamala Harris has, since she got in this race, had the best 30 days in American politics I’ve seen in a very long time,"" he said. ""But she is still tied [in the polls]. The Democrats have clawed up from five points down to tied. So it's still a tight race with 75 days left. “ The mood here may have hit fever pitch last night, but a toss-up race shows that Democrats still have a lot of work to do if they are to be sure of winning the White House. Trump appears to be struggling to work out how to campaign against Harris. He doesn’t seem to know what line of attack to take, and hasn’t even settled on one of his customary nicknames. One prominent Democratic strategist told me he believes Trump will soon work out how to define Ms Harris in a way that best serves his campaign, as that is his great political skill. And when he does this election will get much harder for Harris. For all the buoyancy and optimism that’s been radiating from the convention stage, there have been warnings too. In her speech on Tuesday night, Michelle Obama cautioned the election would be extremely tight. “We need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt,” she told the crowd. “We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us”. Her husband Barack Obama followed up with a similar exhortation, in what amounted to a one-two punch designed to motivate the thousands in the arena to hit the streets when they return to their hometowns across the country. “It’s up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in,” the former president said. “And make no mistake, it will be a fight.” Candidates standing for election in key swing states that will decide the outcome of this election know all too well how much work there is to do. “I’ve been telling Democrats everywhere I go this week: ‘Don’t get high on your own supply and think everyone is as energetic as you are’,” Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin, who is in a tight Senate race in Michigan, told Politico. On the convention floor, delegates clearly buoyed by the events of this week appeared to have taken the Obamas’ message to heart. Cameron Landin, a 21-year-old from Georgia, a key southern battleground state won by the Democrats in the last election for the first time in 28 years, said he knew victory could not be taken for granted. ""I really do believe Kamala Harris is going to win,"" he said, a few hours before Harris took to the stage. ""That doesn't mean I'm not nervous."" The regional organiser from the city of Savannah said people like him would focus on one thing: boosting turnout. ""That means people doing 60-plus-hour weeks and seven days a week of organising. It means volunteers getting out there – phone-banking, calling on voters, canvassing.” ""That's what's going to win this,"" he said, pointing at the crowd of delegates waving posters for Harris and Walz. ""People on the ground."" Nevada Democratic Representative Susie Lee, who represents a district that includes part of Las Vegas – said she was under no illusions the election would be extremely competitive, particularly in her swing state. ""It's not at all in the bag,"" she said. Some precincts in Nevada, she explained, could be decided by as little as 50 to 100 votes. “Clearly, we have to get people engaged and out to the polls. ""But I'll tell you - I do think people are exhausted with Donald Trump,"" the congresswoman said. ""There's a clear choice between Harris and Trump. I think people see it."" Millions of voters watched the political festival the Democrats put on in Chicago – more than 20m viewers tuned in for each of the first three nights. The Harris-Walz team will almost certainly get a further bump in the opinion polls after this week. But that’s to be expected following any party convention. The question will be whether the momentum they have been riding will last, especially as the country learns more about Harris, who has so far avoided tough media interviews and released little in the way of policy detail. Trump has a grip on nearly half of the country. And they know him well after three successive presidential campaigns. The Democrats could certainly win this election, but they will have their work cut out. Additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5ekxlwzgo,Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends campaign and backs Trump,"Trump praises RFK Jr as ""phenomenal"" at a rally, but members of the Kennedy clan accuse him of ""betrayal"".",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Independent White House candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has joined the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, on stage at a rally in Arizona after dropping out of the race and endorsing the former US president. Mr Kennedy, 70, a Democrat for most of his life and the scion of the Kennedy dynasty, said the principles that had led him to leave the party had now compelled him ""to throw my support to President Trump"". He said in a press conference in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday that he would seek to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states.   Before welcoming RFK Jr to the stage on Friday, Trump promised, if elected, to release all remaining documents relating to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy. Trump praised Mr Kennedy as ""phenomenal"" and ""brilliant"" at the rally later in Glendale. Democratic rival Kamala Harris said she would try to ""earn"" the support of Kennedy voters. With November's election looming, Mr Kennedy's polling has slumped from a high of double figures as funds and national coverage dried up. The son of US Senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of President John F Kennedy, he is from the most famed family in Democratic politics.  Mr Kennedy's decision to back a Republican for the White House has outraged his relatives, who previously condemned his invocation of the family name in a Super Bowl ad back in February. Kerry Kennedy, his sister, said his support for Trump was a ""betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.""  “This decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends,” Mr Kennedy said on Friday. “But I have the certainty that this is what I’m meant to do. And that certainty gives me internal peace, even in storms.” He is married to Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm. She posted on X, formerly Twitter, that she deeply respected her husband’s decision to suspend his campaign. She did not comment on his endorsement of Trump. Mr Kennedy told reporters on Friday that Trump's insistence he could end the war in Ukraine by negotiating with Russia ""alone would justify my support for his campaign"". ""There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences. But we are aligned on other key issues."" He said he would remove his name from 10 states where his presence would be a ""spoiler"" to Trump's effort. He has already withdrawn from the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania. But it is too late for him to pull out from the swing states of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, election officials told AP news agency. Mr Kennedy said he had launched his campaign in April 2023 ""as a Democrat, the party of my father, my uncle... the champions of the Constitution"". But he left because ""it had become the party of war, censorship, corruption, big pharma, big tech, big money"".  He blamed his decision to suspend his campaign on ""media control"" and his former party's efforts to thwart his run, adding: ""In my heart I no longer believe I have a realistic path to victory in the face of relentless and systematic censorship."" Mr Kennedy hovered around 14% - 16% in polls at his most popular. However, his ratings have slumped to single digits since Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee.  He said in his press conference that he had offered to work with Ms Harris and her bid for the White House. Democrats sounded unfazed by his announcement.  ""Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,"" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement. Mr Kennedy's campaign became synonymous with the anti-vaccine movement as he frequently touted his leadership of the Children's Health Defense organisation, formerly known as the World Mercury Project. In recent weeks, Mr Kennedy recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub that had been hit by a car in New York's Central Park in 2014 as a joke.  Earlier in his campaign, it was revealed that he had suffered from a brain parasite over a decade ago which caused severe memory loss and brain fog. His announcement capped days of rumour that Mr Kennedy offered to endorse Trump to secure a role in his next administration.  Trump told CNN earlier this week he would ""certainly be open"" to Mr Kennedy playing a role, while Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, said he would be suited to ""blow up"" a federal department.  Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, told the BBC that Mr Kennedy's decision highlighted the two-party system in the US and ""how difficult it is to get new ideas and fresh people into the process"".  Mike Wendling also contributed to this report.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9dj4vdx2jo,'Coach Walz' rallies Democrats with personal pitch to middle America,"The running mate of Kamala Harris told the Democratic convention that voters should back ""the right team"" and ""turn the page on Donald Trump"".",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Tim Walz is running for vice-president, but for a while on Wednesday night, it felt like he was campaigning to be the nation’s high school football coach. Before he spoke, roughly a dozen of the players on the team he helped coach to a Minnesota state championship decades ago ran on stage, some wearing their old high-school jerseys, bouncing to the blasting horns of a marching band. Once Mr Walz did appear, delegates in the packed arena waved signs that read “Coach Walz” – and the crowd chanted “coach, coach, coach!” As this was Mr Walz's first significant opportunity to introduce himself to the nation, his speech was heavy on his personal story – his time as a football coach, of course, but also his upbringing, his enlistment in the Army National Guard, his work as a high-school teacher, and his service as a congressman and governor. During parts of his speech his daughter Hope, 23, and son Gus, 17, were seen in  tears in the front row of the arena. ""That's my dad!"" Gus mouthed as the television camera focused on him. In the folksy style that the Democratic campaign believes connects with moderate voters in the crucial states of the Midwest, he told the crowd that he was ""ready to turn the page on these guys"", referring to Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance. ""So say it with me: 'We are not going back.'"" He followed a diverse range of speakers and entertainers who took to the stage on the third night of the convention in Chicago, with Oprah Winfrey receiving the most raucous response after a surprise appearance in her hometown.  The four-day party extravaganza will culminate on Thursday evening when Vice-President Kamala Harris formally accepts the Democratic nomination, a little over a month after President Joe Biden stepped out of the race. But on Wednesday night, everything built up to Tim Walz, a man virtually unknown to most Americans just weeks ago. He drew from the first speech he gave in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, earlier this month after being chosen as Kamala Harris's running mate, repurposing some of the same zingers. “In Minnesota, we respect our neighbours and the personal choices they make,” he said. “And even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a Golden Rule - mind your own damn business!”  Personal freedom has become a common refrain among Democrats at this convention and in pivoting to it, Mr Walz described ""the hell of infertility"". IVF fertility treatment has become entangled in America's debate over abortion rights and the Minnesota governor has repeatedly alluded to the process on the campaign trail when talking about his family's story. His wife, Gwen, recently clarified that they went through a different procedure, drawing Republican criticism that Mr Walz had been misleading. On the convention stage, he said he wanted to talk about their struggle having children because this election was about ""freedom"".  “When we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean your freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people you love,"" he said. “The freedom to make your own health care decisions. And, yeah, your kids’ freedom to go to school without worrying they’ll be shot dead in the halls.”  He also touted the Democratic priorities he has enacted while serving as Minnesota governor – including free school lunches, paid family and medical leave, middle-class tax cuts and lower prescription drug prices. “While other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours,” he said to cheers. But it was the coaching theme he returned to again and again. When going on the attack against Donald Trump and JD Vance, he pointed to a frequent Democratic target – Project 2025, a think-tank policy blueprint designed in part by former Trump administration officials. The former president has disavowed its contents, but Mr Walz had a rejoinder. “I coached high school football long enough, I promise you this - when somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they’re going to use it,” he said. And in closing, he poured on the football metaphors, promising a pep-talk as the crowd again chanted “coach”.  “It’s the fourth quarter,” he said. “We’re down a field goal. But we’re on offence. We’re driving down the field. And, boy, do we have the right team to win this.” Earlier in the evening, Ms Harris – if she were watching – had a chance to see a few of rumoured finalists in her vice-presidential selection process on stage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke of the positive effect government had opening the door way for him to start a family as a gay man. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also hit on the personal freedom theme – focusing heavily on education, reproductive rights and fair elections. “Kamala and Tim’s names may be on the ballot,” he said, “but it’s our rights and our freedoms on the line.” Ms Harris opted for Mr Walz, however – and his particular talents were on display Wednesday night. He didn’t have Mr Shapiro’s soaring rhetoric or Mr Buttigieg’s eloquence, but Democrats hope his flat midwestern accent, his somewhat rotund physique and his thinning hair – combined with the small-town coach speak – will appeal to the kind of voters who have abandoned the Democratic Party when Trump is on the ballot. Many Republicans said they were relieved at Mr Walz’s selection, as they feared the appeal Mr Shapiro would have in key battleground Pennsylvania.  And they’ve already been on the attack against the Minnesota governor – criticising what they view as too-liberal policies as governor and contending that he not only misrepresented the nature of his family's fertility treatments but also his rank in the Minnesota National Guard. They haven’t yet found a way to dent his coaching record, however. And if Wednesday night in Chicago was any indication, that – as much as anything – is going to be a central focus of the Walz’s pitch to the public. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y58l08082o,Kamala Harris pledges 'new way forward' in historic convention speech,The Democrat formally becomes the first black and Asian-American woman to lead a major presidential ticket.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris pledged a ""new way forward"" for all Americans as she formally accepted the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday night, delivering a message of unity and urging voters to reject Donald Trump. November's election is a chance to ""move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past"", she said, bringing her party's convention in Chicago to a close as balloons rained down and supporters cheered. Ms Harris's speech capped off a four-day spectacle designed to highlight her backstory and shape the contours of what remains a vague policy agenda. She made history as the first black and Asian-American woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket. The 59-year-old officially became the Democratic nominee after a fast-moving few weeks that began with President Joe Biden stepping aside in the White House race. Polls suggest she is now in a tight race with Trump, who offered criticism of Ms Harris's appearance as it unfolded. Ms Harris used her nearly 45-minute address, the most important speech of her political career, to reintroduce herself to the nation. She shared personal anecdotes about growing up in a ""beautiful working-class neighbourhood"" as the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants. And she argued that her background as a prosecutor - a detail she avoided emphasising during her 2020 run - made her uniquely qualified to defeat Trump and serve in the Oval Office, as did her record as vice-president under Mr Biden.  Ms Harris also dedicated several minutes of her speech to how her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, shaped her life and political career. ""She taught us to never complain about injustice, but (instead) to do something about it,"" Ms Harris recalled. Her sister Maya, 57, also spoke on Thursday night, saying their mother had been a ""trailblazer"", having set ""great expectations of us"".  ""She raised us to believe that we could be or do anything,"" she said, to loud applause. ""It's a distinctly American story."" Ms Harris made a pitch to aspirational families across America, saying she would create an ""opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed"". She said she would ""end America's housing shortage"" and help entrepreneurs. However, did not describe any specific changes in policy from the administration in which she currently serves. Trump reacted to his rival's speech on his social media platform Truth Social, and called into Fox News after the event concluded to criticise her remarks.  He questioned her record during four years in the White House as vice-president. “Why didn’t she do something about the things of which she complains?” the Republican wrote. Five weeks ago, Democrats thought their party extravaganza would be centred on President Joe Biden, as he ran for another term despite widespread anxiety about his age and whether he could defeat Trump.  But a plot twist came in late July, when Mr Biden, bowing to party pressure after a poor debate performance, announced he would step aside and throw his support behind Ms Harris.  Within days, party leaders, delegates and potential challengers coalesced behind Ms Harris's candidacy. And in Chicago, the vice-president's speech was well received by the delegates who had given her their official backing for the top job.  ""I think she set the tone for the enthusiasm Democrats are going to have from now until November,"" Georgia delegate Edward Bohannan told the BBC. ""There wasn't much excitement about the election before. But now people are getting engaged.""  Among the other figures who energised the convention's thousands of attendees over the previous days were Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, and even Republican defectors. It was Mr Biden, 81, who delivered the keynote speech on the first night, in a symbolic passing of the torch. While on holiday in California, he also called Ms Harris to wish her luck with her own speech.  The DNC's fourth night also featured speakers emphasisng the toll of gun violence, an issue Ms Harris focused on as California's top prosecutor and one she has pursued during her vice-presidency. Mr Biden last year created an office dedicated to combating gun violence and named Ms Harris to lead it.  Gabby Giffords, a leading gun safety advocate and former US congresswoman who was shot in the head 2011 in Arizona, appeared alongside her husband, Senator Mark Kelly, who was a leading contender to be Ms Harris's running mate. Georgia Congresswoman Lucy MacBath, who has pushed for gun restrictions and was elected after her son was shot and killed, also delivered remarks. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democratic rising star who also was  floated as a potential vice-presidential pick for Ms Harris, described the Democratic candidate as ""tough, tested, and a total badass"".   Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman who now backs the Democrats, used his moment in the spotlight to attack Trump. ""It’s in standing up for our constitution and our democracy that that is the soul of being a conservative,"" said Mr Kinzinger. ""It used to be the soul of being a Republican, but Donald Trump has suffocated the soul of the Republican Party."" ""Democrats are just as patriotic as we are,"" he added as the crowd broke out in chants of ""USA"".  But DNC organisers rejected protesters' demands to allow a Palestinian to speak, following days of protests in Chicago against the war in Gaza and White House policy. Ms Harris did not directly address the protesters, though she did touch on Gaza. She said she would always defend Israel's right to security, while calling for Palestinians to live with ""dignity"" and ""freedom"". A packed arena featured delegates and supporters brandishing American flags and placards bearing Ms Harris's name. Many donned white clothing in honour of the women's suffrage movement. And there was no shortage of star power on Thursday - following a packed programme of celebrity appearances on the previous nights, which was also witnessed at last month's Republican convention.  Steph Curry - a basketball star who is part of Ms Harris's hometown NBA team the Golden State Warriors, and who recently led Team USA to Olympic gold - delivered a video message. There were performances from Pink and The Chicks (formerly the Dixie Chicks).  But those hoping for a showing from Beyoncé were left disappointed, after rumours throughout the evening of a ""surprise guest"" led to some hope that the star would perform her hit Freedom, which Ms Harris has used as a campaign song. By the time 100,000 red, white and blue balloons dropped from the ceiling, hope of a rockstar ending quickly deflated.  ""After all that, no Beyoncé,"" one man joked as he left, popping balloons with his foot.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy49xlx54vo,Four takeaways from Kamala Harris's convention speech,The vice-president hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but her vision for the future lacked detail.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, delivering a speech which hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but had only rare moments of soaring rhetoric and broke little new ground. The ground-breaking was in the nature of the nominee herself - the first woman of colour to become a major party's presidential nominee. “Never let anyone tell you who you are,” Ms Harris said. “You show them who you are.” But for roughly 45 minutes on Thursday, she tried to tell Americans who she is - and what she would do if she wins the White House.  Here are four takeaways from her convention-closing remarks.  Many Americans know who Ms Harris is, but not many know what she believes in or details of her background. First and foremost, her convention speech set out to change that. She recounted her mother’s journey as an immigrant from India. She spoke about how her parents met – and how they ultimately divorced. She talked about her childhood upbringing in a working-class neighbourhood in Oakland, California. “The middle class is where I come from,” she said. “My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us.” Ms Harris also spoke of why she chose to become a lawyer – and a prosecutor. She drew a line from her early days in the courtroom to her public services as a politician. “My entire career, I have only had one client,” she said. “The people.” Ms Harris’s speech included calls for unity and a pathway beyond the “bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles” of modern American politics. She said that the US had a “precious, fleeting” opportunity to “chart a new path forward”. But that chart had few details. Vague calls for unity and a path beyond partisanship are rhetoric many presidential hopefuls have used in the past.  When Ms Harris did turn to policy details, she spoke in generalities.  She said she will be focused on lowering the costs of “everyday needs” – including healthcare, housing and groceries. She specifically called out abortion rights – and framed it as a means of preserving freedom, which has been a recurring theme at this Democratic convention. “America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially about matters of heart and home,” she said. Ms Harris, in her speech, styled herself as a centre-left moderate, putting little daylight between her policies and those of her boss, the man she hopes to replace, Joe Biden. “Everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation ready to move forward,” she said. “Ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America.” The exact details of that step, however, are to be determined. As pro-Palestinian protesters marched outside the convention, Ms Harris devoted particular attention in the foreign-policy section of her speech to the Gaza war. Here, yet again, there was little difference between her rhetoric and views and those of Mr Biden – and she linked herself to the president several times. “President Biden and I are working around the clock,” she said, “because now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire done.” She also pledged to ensure that Israel always has the ability to defend itself and took particular note of the brutality of the 7 October Hamas attack. For a moment, it sounded like some in the crowd would jeer, but Ms Harris quickly moved on to the plight of Palestinians, saying that the scale of their suffering was “heartbreaking”. That will hardly be enough to satisfy the protesters outside, however, and they could return to their homes – some in key battleground states like Michigan – convinced that a Harris presidency would be a continuation of the Biden Gaza War policies. Two days ago, Michelle and Barack Obama formed a tag-team that belittled former president Donald Trump for what they charaterised as his small obsessions and petty personality. Ms Harris also took swipes at her Republican opponent, but they were pretty standard fare for Democrats – including Mr Biden - over the past few months. “In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man,” she said. “But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.” She brought up the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, and mentioned his criminal convictions. She also hit what has become a favourite Democratic punching bag, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a Republican presidency. Although the former president has disavowed the plan, she noted that it was written by his advisers and it sought to “pull our country back into the past”. The future vs the past contrast has been a central theme of the Harris campaign so far, as it was in her nomination acceptance speech.  It’s one of the ways the vice-president has been able to draw a distinction not only from her current Republican opponent, but from the unpopular aspects of her boss, Joe Biden, who just a few weeks ago was the presumptive Democratic nominee.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cged20l3nq8o,Kamala Harris campaign is light on policy - but that's helped her transform the race,"The campaign is light on policy, writes Anthony Zurcher - so can energy alone beat Donald Trump?",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The month since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign has been a largely unprecedented spell in American politics: never has a modern general election campaign gone from a standstill to a full sprint so quickly.  In that time Democrats pulled together a well-scripted national convention with slickly produced promotional videos, political set-pieces and musical interludes, all done to boost the new nominee. It was a remarkable test of skill by party operatives under extreme pressure. Over the course of four days in Chicago – and in the packed campaign rallies Ms Harris has held over the past few weeks – the outlines of her campaign strategy have begun to take shape.  And it’s not exactly what one would expect from a sitting vice-president who has occupied an office in the White House for three-and-a-half-years. Ms Harris is pushing hard to be viewed as the candidate of change in this race. One who, as she said in her convention speech on Thursday, can ""chart a new way forward"". This strategy is in part born out of necessity. Across the globe democracies have been roiled by voter unrest. As economies struggle to recover from the Covid pandemic, regional conflicts churn and tensions over immigration flare up, political incumbents have faced deeply unhappy electorates in Canada, the UK, Germany and India among others. Polling indicated that President Joe Biden, before he abandoned his re-election campaign last month, was set to confront similar challenges. The vice-president has turned this situation on its head. Her background and personal story is a sharp contrast with both the current president and her Republican opponent. It also helps that Ms Harris is running against a former president who, while also styling himself as a change candidate, has his own sometimes controversial, sometimes unpopular White House record to defend. “This election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for the future,” Ms Harris said at a rally in North Carolina last week.  “Ours focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.” For the most part, Ms Harris has shied away from describing in detail what her presidency would look like.  There’s talk of unity and a way beyond America’s divisive partisanship; a focus on strengthening the economy and reducing consumer prices; and a heavy emphasis on reproductive rights and abortion – an area of particular strength for Democrats. But it is vague. And this vagueness may suit the Harris campaign just fine.  By largely being an empty policy vessel, Ms Harris has allowed various constituencies within the Democratic Party to project their hopes and priorities onto her.  If she can keep all those pieces together for the next few months, she might just win. Labour leaders expressed optimism that she would focus on union protections and bread-and-butter economic issues.  Climate activists touted the Biden administration’s clean energy legislation and expected the candidate to expand that effort.  Civil rights leaders predicted the first woman of colour to win a major party nomination would advance racial equality. “The fundamental question people ask is, are you fighting for me, or are you fighting for someone else?” said Tom Perez, who served as secretary of labour in the Obama administration and has been an adviser to the Biden White House.  ""I think people have a pretty clear sense that she's a fighter for everyone, not just certain people in certain zip codes or certain tax brackets, not just people of certain races or ethnicities, but everyone."" In other words, the vice-president’s policy vagueness has allowed her to cast as broad an appeal as possible in what is shaping up to be an election where every undecided voter counts.  It has been labelled by some as a ""vibe"" campaign - based at least in part on feeling and general impressions. On Wednesday, former television host, author and international celebrity Oprah Winfrey, who identified herself as a political independent, said Ms Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were the candidates who would deliver “decency and respect”. “I’m calling on all you independents and all you undecideds,” she said. “Values and character matter most of all, in leadership and in life.” Throughout the week, a parade of Republicans – including former officeholders and Donald Trump supporters – also took the stage at the convention to pitch Harris as the best option in November. “Harris will want to be centre-left, not far-left,” said Chris Shays, a former Republican congressman from Connecticut who attended the Democratic Convention this year. According to Mr Shays, the vice-president will be pulled to the American political middle because that is where the nation is. Ms Harris’s strategy is not without risk, however.  Just as Democratic groups are projecting their ideas onto the vice-president’s campaign, so are her Republican opponents. And they are using Ms Harris’s past, more liberal – and sometimes controversial – positions and statements as evidence that the lack of specificity is merely a cover for a left-wing agenda. “Her speech was the perfect example of what happens when you have no solutions to offer for the problems you've delivered to Americans' doorsteps, so you gaslight and deflect,” the Trump campaign said in a statement responding to the vice-president’s convention address. Ms Harris has also avoided sweeping press conferences and more pointed interviews with mainstream media outlets so far – interviews that could hold her to account for past positions and press her for further policy details. Her speech last week addressing the economy was one of the few instances where the vice-president unveiled concrete new proposals. But over the past four days some nuggets of how she would govern have emerged. She has proposed a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She pledged to use the power of government to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and punish price-gouging for groceries. She backed bipartisan immigration legislation that was blocked in the Senate earlier this year. Ms Harris also pledged to push for a federal law that would guarantee a basic right to abortion across the entire US, pre-empting conservative state bans. For some Democrats the details so far aren’t enough. “We need to hear some actual policy things,” said Lewanna Tucker, chair of the Democratic Party in Fulton County, Georgia. “She needs to be letting us a little bit more behind the curtain and talk about structural things that are going to be done.” Perhaps more concrete policy details aren't necessary. At a time when American politics is viewed by much of the American public as divisive and toxic, there may be benefit to building a political campaign not around policy specifics, but rather one that appeals to emotion.  In 2008, Barack Obama successfully campaigned on hope and change – which is not exactly the makings of a four-point plan. “It's a return to a level of hope that I don't think that we have collectively experienced since 2008,” said Yasmin Radjy, who runs the liberal grassroots organising group Swing Left. She said there had been an exhaustion among volunteers on the left for the past eight years, but the switch to Ms Harris was “like a weight had lifted off their shoulders"". The willingness by Democrats to savage the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 – a sometimes controversial blueprint for a new Republican administration that Trump and his campaign have repeatedly disavowed – also shows the risks of being even tangentially associated with the nuts and bolts of governing. In her Thursday night address, Ms Harris pledged to move beyond partisan divisions and find shared common ground. ""I promise to be a president for all Americans,"" she said. ""You can always trust me to put country above party and self."" Those promises aren’t unfamiliar in American politics, of course. Similar assurances have been made over the last few decades. But something has been different about this Democratic nominee and Democratic convention. The wattage of star power this week – with appearances by Pink, Stevie Wonder and Lil Jon, among others – and the campaign’s heavy reliance on pop culture connections, like Charlie XCX, suggest it is trying to position itself as a cultural movement rather than a political one. It remains to be seen whether this will be an effective strategy. But at least for now, it has pulled the Democratic Party out of the doldrums and despair of early July and into a dead heat with Trump and the Republicans heading into the crucial final months of this campaign."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n1v4k4rzo,Barack and Michelle Obama electrify Democrats but warn of tight race,"The couple lauded Kamala Harris but urged their party members to ""get to work"" if they wanted to defeat Donald Trump.",21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Michelle and Barack Obama gave resounding endorsements of Kamala Harris on Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, exhorting party supporters across the US to turn out and vote to defeat Donald Trump in November. ""Hope is making a comeback,"" Mrs Obama told the crowd at the DNC in Chicago, echoing her husband's campaign promise of ""hope and change"". In their back-to-back speeches, the Democratic Party's most popular figures praised Ms Harris, while excoriating Trump - whose presidency was characterised by ""bluster and chaos"", in the words of Mr Obama. But the couple also warned their party not to lose sight of what remains an extremely tight race amid the enthusiasm for Ms Harris's campaign. They stressed the election would be decided in a handful of key swing states.  ""Make no mistake, it will be a fight,” said the 63-year-old former president Mr Obama.  Michelle Obama, 60, stressed the point further. ""We need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt,"" she said. ""We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us."" Mr Obama emphasised America's preparedness for a ""new chapter"", adding: ""We are ready for a President Kamala Harris. And Kamala Harris is ready for the job."" The Obamas' appeal to Democrats to turn out in November exposed a deeper party anxiety about the narrow race between Ms Harris and Trump, who retains a tight hold on his loyal base of supporters across the country. Ms Harris has a slender lead in national polling averages but pollsters caution that the race remains a virtual tie in the handful of battleground states that will ultimately decide who wins under America's electoral college system. Though Ms Harris is technically the incumbent candidate, she has described herself and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as the underdogs in the race. The Obamas also acknowledged the renewed sense of excitement within the party since Ms Harris replaced President Joe Biden following his exit from the race - making a tacit reference to the enthusiasm and message of hope that powered Mr Obama to victory in his 2008 presidential run against Republican John McCain.  Mr Obama also went on to serve a second term, before Trump won the White House in 2016. Mrs Obama, whose most memorable line from her last convention speech in 2016 was, ""when they go low, we go high"", did little to lower the temperature of the heated political rhetoric that has divided the country over the last decade. She attacked Trump for assailing her family and continuing to push ""ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people's lives better"".  In a broadside that generated some of the loudest cheers of the night, she mocked Trump for his use of the term ""black jobs"" on the campaign trail. ""Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs?"" she said, referring to her husband's presidency. Mrs Obama also used her platform to remember her late mother, Chicago-raised Marian Robinson, who died earlier this year aged 86.  ""I wasn't even sure if I could be steady enough to stand before you tonight, but my heart compelled me to,"" she told the audience. Trump and running mate JD Vance have been holding rallies and events in swing states while the Democrats gather in Chicago. On Tuesday afternoon, Mr Vance used a news conference in neighbouring Wisconsin to attack Ms Harris over the ""failures"" of her vice-presidency. He zeroed in on crime and public safety, and the economy - two areas where the Republicans see a vulnerability. Referring to protests in the city of Kenosha after the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake in 2020, he said: ""Wisconsin has suffered when you don't have good, smart, pro-public safety and leadership, and that’s what Donald Trump and I want to bring back to the White House.”  Having travelled to Wisconsin, Ms Harris was not present at day two of the convention in Chicago. But the event did feature a jubilant and star-studded roll call, with delegates from each state - as well as US territories - symbolically casting a vote for Ms Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in the arena. Though the vice-president formally clinched her party’s nomination earlier this month, the symbolic gesture quickly turned into a dance party.  Lil Jon performed Turn Down For What before Georgia’s announced its vote. Actor Sean Astin spoke during Indiana’s turn, a nod to his role in the cult classic American football film Rudy, which is set in the state. An on-stage DJ spun songs for each state as delegates, on their feet and wearing bracelets that flashed red and white, delivered short speeches about why they were supporting Ms Harris and Mr Walz. The vice-president then virtually addressed the crowd from her rally in Milwaukee - 90 miles away - at the same venue where Trump accepted his party's nomination four weeks ago.  ""We are so honoured to be your nominees,"" she said of herself and Mr Walz. ""I'll see you in two days, Chicago."" Before the Obamas gave their speeches, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Ms Harris's husband, made his own appearance to share personal stories about the vice-president - including how they were set up on a blind date by one of his clients in 2013. He spoke about their ""big, beautiful, blended family"", referring to his son, Cole, and daughter, Ella, from his first marriage. He described Ms Harris as a ""joyful warrior"" and a supportive parent who put their family first despite the demands of her job. Ms Harris, who was flying back from her rally during her husband's speech, kept Air Force Two in the air so she could watch his speech live, the White House said.  Mr Emhoff said the two would celebrate their 10th anniversary on Thursday night, when Ms Harris formally accepts the party's nomination in a primetime speech.  ""Kamala was exactly the right person for me at an important moment in my life,"" he said. ""And at this moment in our nation's history, she is exactly the right president.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyw1l4lgnlo,Kamala Harris convention speech fact-checked,BBC Verify has looked into some of the claims made by Kamala Harris at the DNC in Chicago.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has given her acceptance speech at the party's national convention in Chicago. She spoke about her upbringing, her career and made a number of claims about Donald Trump's record and what he would do if he won the election. BBC Verify has looked into some of these. CLAIM:  Trump would ""enact a nationwide abortion ban”. VERDICT: This is misleading. Trump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban and that he believes the issue should be left to individual states. While president, Trump appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Roe v Wade was a ruling that protected the federal constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years until it was overturned in June 2022. Subsequently, 22 states banned abortion or restricted the procedure to earlier in a pregnancy than had been set by Roe v Wade. In 14 of these states, abortion is banned in almost all circumstances, with 10 not making an exception for rape or incest. CLAIM: “As a part of his [Trump’s] agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control.” VERDICT: This is misleading. Trump has not said he would do this. Ms Harris appears to be referring to Project 2025, a document published by a right-wing research group, the Heritage Foundation.   It outlines policies it would like Trump to implement, including limiting access to some contraceptive pills and ending taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood.  The former president responded on his social media platform Truth Social, saying: “I do not limit access to birth control - that is a lie.” Ms Harris has repeatedly tried to link Project 2025 to Trump but he has distanced himself from it, saying: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.” However, according to an investigation by CNN, at least 140 former Trump administration officials have been involved in the project.  CLAIM: “Trump tax… would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year."" VERDICT: This is based on one estimate of how much Trump's plan to impose tariffs - or taxes - on imported goods might cost US households. Other estimates are smaller.  The ""almost $4,000"" figure comes from analysis by the left-of-centre think tank the Centre for American Progress of Trump’s pledge to increase tariffs on all imported goods to 10-20% and all goods imported from China to 60%. They took the amount the US buys in goods from abroad annually, figured out how much the new taxes on these goods would be and divided this by the number of households in the US. It works out at $4,600 per household, but when you look at “middle income” families you get a figure of $3,900 a year. Other estimates are lower. The Peterson Institute reckons the impact would be closer to $1,700 a year. Trump insists the cost of his tariffs would be felt by foreign countries instead. It is difficult to assess the exact impact of these taxes but studies, on previous tariffs, have suggested that some of the cost was passed on to American businesses and consumers.  CLAIM: ""Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal."" VERDICT: Trump did publicly call for Republicans to vote against the Biden administration's immigration bill and took credit when it failed. The immigration bill aimed to tighten asylum standards, increase spending on Border Patrol, and allow for the automatic closure of the southern border to illegal crossings if a certain daily threshold was reached. The majority of lawmakers in the US Senate opposed the proposed measures. Trump did not have a vote, but he did call for his Republican lawmakers to oppose it. Trump said the bill was “horrendous” as he thought it was not tough enough on immigration. At a Fox News event in February 2024, he said he was against the deal as passing it would have “made it much better for the opposing side”. The bill was blocked in the Senate for a second time in May. CLAIM: “Trump … threatened to abandon Nato.” VERDICT: This is true. Trump did threaten to leave the alliance. He has also said the US will remain a member as long as European allies increase their defence spending. As president, Trump recalled saying “yes, I will leave you” when asked whether the US would quit Nato if other members didn’t commit to more defence spending. In an interview with GB News earlier this year, he said that the US under his watch would be “100%” committed to Nato as long as European members paid their ""fair share"" of defence costs. During his time in office, Trump did put “tough demands” on Nato members to meet their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, according to Rose Gottemoeller, who was Nato deputy secretary general during Trump’s presidency. In 2016, the year Trump was elected, five countries were spending 2% or more of their GDP on defence. That increased to nine by 2020, the year Biden was elected. And it has now gone up to 23 countries, according to Nato’s 2024 estimates. Additional reporting by Joseph Cassidy & Gerry Georgieva. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4738kvyvmo,Democrats try to turn tables on one of their biggest weaknesses,Democrats used the convention to try to flip the script on Republican criticism of their immigration policies.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"During a week designed to celebrate the party's successes, Democrats on Wednesday sought to confront one of their biggest political weaknesses.  Speakers at the Democratic National Convention tried to flip the script on Republican criticism of their immigration record, praising the Biden administration's efforts and calling Kamala Harris ""tough as nails"" on the issue. Donald Trump and his Republican allies have made the border a focal point of their criticism Ms Harris, calling her a ""failed border czar"". While record numbers of migrants were detained at the border during the Biden administration, the number of unlawful crossings has now fallen for five consecutive months.  Democrats have credited the decrease to recent actions by the administration to curb illegal immigration, including an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in June that allows US immigration officials to deport migrants without processing their asylum claims.  A recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, found that 48% of likely voters believe crossings will go up if Ms Harris wins. A vast majority - 72% - said they believe they will decrease under Trump.  The issue came to the forefront of the DNC on Wednesday, with several speakers defending Ms Harris' record and slamming the former president for standing in the way of a bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in Congress earlier this year. “Let’s be clear, the border is broken,” said New York Congressman Tom Suozzi, who has called for tougher border security and asylum laws.  In echoing a line frequently used by Republicans to attack Mr Biden's immigration policies, Mr Suozzi and other Democrats sought to show the party's shift toward a tougher immigration message on an issue considered to be one of their biggest political vulnerabilities. Mr Suozzi added Ms Harris ""joyfully accepts the challenge to work across party lines, to secure our border, to treat people like human beings"".  The Trump campaign has targeted Ms Harris for her role in the administration's immigration policy, attacking her as a failed ""border czar"". As vice-president, one of Ms Harris's early diplomatic assignments was to address the economic conditions driving a surge of migrants from Central America to the US-Mexico border.  Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, the lead Democratic negotiator who helped broker the measure that failed in Congress in February,  said Ms Harris has been ""tough as nails"" on illegal immigration, pushing back on Republican accusations that she ""opened the border"" to unchecked migration.  ""Kamala Harris knows we can be a nation of immigrants and immigration laws,"" he added. ""That's why, when she's president, she will bring that border bill back, and she'll pass it.""  The senator pointedly blamed Trump for the country's immigration problems. ""Trump killed that bill because he knew if we fixed the border, he'd lose his ability to divide us, his ability to fan the flames of fear about people who come from different places,"" Mr Murphy said.  Mr Murphy's comments were echoed by California Representative Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.  According to Mr Aguilar, voters need not ""choose between a secure border and building an America for all"".  ""Under President Harris, we can and will do both,"" he added.  Later, Democrats played a video highlighting the stricter border policies outlined in the bill, which would have funded new border agents and technologies to combat fetanyl trafficking. On the floor of the DNC, some delegates suggested that immigration will be a secondary electoral issue for many voters more preoccupied with daily concerns - despite polling consistently showing it's a top concern for many. ""Immigration is certainly an important issue,"" said Julie Johnson, a Texas delegate, state representative and candidate for the House of Representatives in Washington.  ""But other people's immigration does not affect whether they can go see a doctor, afford a home or whether they have a good paying job.""  Others were more cautious.  Illinois Democratic Representative Jonathan Jackson - the son of famed civil rights activist Jesse Jackson - told the BBC that work remains to be done, and that he hoped Ms Harris would do more to immediately address the issue if she wins.  ""We're going to have to deal with these migrant issues,"" said Mr Jackson, who argued that economically depressed communities of colour bear the brunt of any migrant influx. ""People don't like to leave their dwellings without clothes or water or cash. But if the conditions are unbearable, they have to leave."" ""I think she has to deal with (it on) day one,"" he added.  On the streets of Chicago - a blue city which saw tens of thousands of migrant arrivals over the last two years - many residents said they were sympathetic to the migrants, even if some were concerned they were a strain on local resources.  ""They [the government] provided food, they provided housing, provided clothing,"" said Naaman Martin, an elderly Chicago resident who plans to vote for Harris. ""But for the homeless, they claim they can't do nothing"". ""It is what it is,"" he added. ""It is not a voting issue for me.""  Alexandra Willis, a 29-year-old store owner and Harris supporter, said she has a ""lot of empathy"" for migrants and wishes they had legal pathways to the country.  “They made it all the way here from another country,"" she said. ""They’re very talented. I’d hire them but legally I can’t.” Immigrants have expressed frustration that their difficult journeys to the US have become a political lightning rod. As the DNC unfolded this week, several dozen, predominantly Venezuelan migrants gathered at a shelter just a few miles away, waiting for volunteers to distribute donated snacks as politicians nearby discussed policies that could eventually determine their fate. While the migrants currently housed there are only vaguely aware of the ongoing convention, they are very familiar with immigration, the border and conceptions of ""migrant crime"" playing a prominent role in the US political debate. Yelitza, a Venezuelan mother of four who fled her country after another son of hers was killed while participating in a protest march, said she feels that migrants are unfairly demonised by politicians, who don't understand the reasons that many left their countries to undertake an extremely perilous journey to the US.  ""The trip was extremely hard. The jungle. Criminals in Mexico. Cartel members wanted to rape my niece. I did the trip with four little kids,"" she said.  ""We're not here because we like it, or because I want to. Everyone needs to understand that,"" she added. ""My country is in a disastrous situation. We only came here to give our children a future."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl2xjxlz3xo,Trump and Harris battle over election’s biggest issue,Both US presidential candidates are trying to win voters over on their plans for the economy.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"After almost a year off the platform, Donald Trump returned to X this week and asked his 89 million followers: “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” It was a clear echo of the famous quote from Ronald Reagan during his victorious 1980 presidential campaign, when he asked: “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” This messaging isn’t surprising. It seems like an obvious strategy for Trump to focus on the economy. That’s because polls consistently suggest it’s the issue American voters care about the most. One such poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov in recent days listed “inflation/prices” and “jobs and the economy” among voters’ top concerns.  Perhaps more importantly, polls also indicate voters are deeply unhappy with the current state of affairs. That seems like a perfect situation for any presidential challenger. But in an election that’s been transformed by Kamala Harris taking over from Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, Trump seems to be struggling to land his simple message on the economy. It is less than a month since he was on stage at the Republican National Convention looking unbeatable, having survived an assassination attempt and riding high in the opinion polls. Now, he has lost that lead and seems to have lost his way. Meanwhile, in the opposition corner, Ms Harris is riding a wave of excitement and enthusiasm that he is finding difficult to counter. The easiest way to burst her bubble would be to remind voters how unhappy they are about high prices and blame her for the inflation that has pushed up the cost of living during the time she has been beside President Biden in the White House. One of the reasons Trump is failing to land that message is the Harris campaign’s strategy of putting proposals to try to lower the cost of living at the heart of her pitch. In a speech in North Carolina on Friday, Ms Harris promised to expand child tax credits, help people to purchase their first homes, and to encourage the building of more affordable housing. She also said she hoped to tackle the persistently high price of food and groceries by banning “price gouging” or excessive corporate profiteering.  ""By any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world,” she said. “Many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives."" Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ought to be able to boast about some very good economic indicators. There is strong growth, record levels of job creation, and this week the inflation rate fell below 3% for the first time during Mr Biden’s presidency. But because prices are still high, voters don’t feel any better off. Voters don’t care about the rate of inflation – they care about the level of prices. “A central banker wants inflation to get back to target. A shopper wants his or her old price back,"" Jared Bernstein, the chair of President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a July speech. When it comes to the economy, “the vibes are off”. “Vibes matter,” Mr Bernstein said. So will the bad economic vibes hurt the Harris campaign? That is what I asked voters over lunch at a crab shack on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Jeff Tester, who works in a nearby marina, said high prices are really hurting him.  “I get paid by the hour. I get up to go to work every day. I think you have to do that to get the American dream,” he said. “But I just know it's getting harder.” And he is very clear about who he sees as responsible. “I blame the Democrats. I believe their policies are hurting the working man,” he said. Every diner I met complained about inflation, but not everyone held Mr Biden or Ms Harris responsible. Dan Nardo, a retired boat broker, said he believed the pandemic, oil prices, foreign wars and supply chain issues have more to do with price rises than the US president. His friend Randy Turk, a retired lawyer, told me that he felt a new administration is likely to follow a similar path to try to reduce inflation, regardless of who wins.  “It's not like a different president can really make that much of a difference,” he said. Ms Harris struggled for prominence and media coverage during most of her time as vice-president. Previously that was seen as a weakness. But if it means she can emerge untainted by “Bidenomics”, it could be one of her greatest strengths. Ruth Igielnik, polling editor at the New York Times, says the latest data she has collected suggests “voters very much tied their negative feelings about the economy to Joe Biden”. Talking to me on the BBC’s Americast podcast,  she explained that in her polling Trump is still favoured on the economy, but where he once had an 18-point lead over Mr Biden he now leads Ms Harris by only about 8 points. “That makes me think voters aren’t necessarily attaching their feelings about the economy to her,” she said. A separate poll this week conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business indicated Ms Harris holds a narrow lead over Trump on who Americans trust to handle the economy. No wonder Republicans are publicly begging Trump to focus on the issues, the economy in particular, and stop launching personal attacks against Ms Harris. In a speech this week, Trump told supporters he was going to talk about the economy but struggled to stay on topic. “They say it’s the most important subject,” he said, ""they"" referring to his advisers and strategists who believe this is his strongest line of attack. “I’m not sure it is. But they say it’s the most important,” he added, before going on to list immigration, crime and the way Ms Harris laughs as top issues. You could practically hear his campaign managers pulling their hair out. “Voters don’t care about personalities or who is drawing larger crowd sizes,” said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “Independent, undecided, swing voters in key states care about the economy and inflation so just focus on those core issues,” he said.  “Stay focused on talking about how you are going to make the lives of Americans better over the next four years.” It was back in 1992 that the Democrat Jim Carville coined the slogan “It’s the economy, stupid” while he was working on Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign. It’s advice that every campaign since has clung to. But Trump, this time around, seems to be finding it uncommonly difficult to stick with. It ought to be a winner for him. After all, according to the Financial Times poll, in answer to his question “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” only 19% of voters say they are."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86ljyv38vxo,"What to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries","The vote will have major global implications, meaning many nations have an incentive to interfere.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America.  And the nature of America’s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. “Our adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. “We are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it"". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China. “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,” US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July.  The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House.  He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.  On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza. “Russia remains the predominant threat to US elections,” according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence.  But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls ""active measures"" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War.  And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked. Russian hackers – likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU – are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts.  Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic. China is the wildcard in terms of interference.  It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it ""probably does not plan to influence the outcome"" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China’s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything.  Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration’s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.  Beijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations. Back in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data.  And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not.  However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared.  But America’s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2g4dy4zr0o,Convention spotlight shines on Biden – with speech he never wanted to give,"The president lauded Kamala Harris and said he gave his ""heart and soul to this nation”.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It was not the speech Joe Biden wanted to give. At least, not this year, under these circumstances. But if anyone knows how quickly fortunes can change, it’s this president – whose personal and professional life has been scarred by tragedy and adversity. Speaking to a packed arena in Chicago on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Mr Biden offered a full-throated defence of his presidency – touching on many of the themes that he campaigned on in 2020 and again this year before abandoning his re-election bid in mid-July, a few weeks after a catastrophic debate performance. ""Like many of you, I gave my heart and soul to this nation,” he said, towards the end of a nearly hour-long address punctuated by raucous shouts of ""Thank you, Joe"". Mr Biden had walked out onto the stage after being introduced by his daughter Ashley and wife, Jill, who told the audience she ""saw him dig deep into his soul"" when he decided to exit the presidential race. After hugging Ashley, he put a tissue to his eyes to dab away the tears. The president touched his heart, and stood a little straighter at the lectern, flashing a toothy smile as the crowd continued to cheer. His speech had a keen eye on his place in history but he spent time singing the praises of his vice-president - the woman he hopes will succeed him in the White House. “Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee and it's the best decision I made my whole career,” he said. “She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity.” Unlike his Oval Office address four weeks ago, Mr Biden did not speak directly of passing the torch to a new generation - but the message was clear enough. After the president concluded his remarks, Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff came out to embrace Mr Biden and his wife, Jill. “I love you,” the vice-president mouthed to Mr Biden after their hug. While Mr Biden spent much of the end of his speech focusing on Ms Harris – a tacit acknowledgment that how she fares against Donald Trump in November's vote could make or break how history, and his party, remembers him - many of the evening’s earlier speakers directed their tributes to the current White House resident. It started with a planned – but unannounced – appearance by Ms Harris herself, who took the stage to thunderous applause. “Joe, thank you for your historic leadership and for your lifetime of service to our nation and for all you continue to do,” she said. “We are forever grateful to you.”  Later, Delaware Senator Chris Coons – one of Mr Biden’s closest allies – took his turn singing the president’s praises. “I’ve never known a more compassionate man than Joe Biden,” he said. “I’ve never known a man who has taken from his own loss and his own faith and delivered so much for the future of so many others.” Hillary Clinton offered her own tribute when she appeared on stage earlier in the evening, telling the crowd that Mr Biden had ""brought dignity, decency and competence back to the White House"". The 2016 Democratic nominee received an extended ovation, and she noted that while she did not break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” by becoming the first woman president, “on the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office”. The reception Mr Biden received from the packed Democratic convention hall was equally electric. The Democrats here in Chicago have been jubilant all day. But the cheers for the president could be as much a sign of gratitude for his grudging decision to step aside as it was a tribute to a storied political career that began in 1972 when he was first elected to Congress at the age of 29. Tomorrow, Barack Obama will address the convention crowd. On Wednesday, Bill Clinton will have his turn. Both are former presidents who stood for – and won – re-election. Mr Biden will not have that opportunity. Instead, he was left to define and defend his legacy as a one-term president in a speech that, barring a major national event in the next five months, will be his final address to a massive American television audience. Toward the end of the speech, he quoted a line from a song, American Anthem. “Let me know in my heart when my days are through, that America, America, I gave my best to you,” he said. The crowd erupted in another round of applause. Eight years ago, Mr Biden passed up a presidential bid in favour of Mrs Clinton – under some not so subtle pressure from Mr Obama. Four years ago, he won the nomination, but the Covid pandemic denied him an opportunity to bask in adulation of a packed Democratic convention hall and the celebratory post-speech balloon drop. This, then, was as close to a Democratic convention moment in the spotlight Mr Biden will get. After his speech concluded – past midnight on the US east coast - the president left the arena and headed to Air Force One for a flight to California for a holiday. His time in Chicago, at this Democratic National Convention, was measured in hours, not days. And despite his desires just a few months ago, his remaining time as president will be measured in months, not years.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrgp30j6z1o,Trump lashes out as DNC attacks throw him off message,The biggest concern for aides is keeping him focused on the issues and off controversial personal attacks.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump isn't in Chicago but his presence hangs over everything and he is clearly following events here. Ahead of Kamala Harris's speech on Thursday, a couple of Trump aides told me, a little implausibly, that the former president is not tuning into the Democratic National Convention because he has no interest in watching a Democratic Party ""infomercial"".  But one senior campaign official confirms, anonymously, that Trump is watching and is irritated by the attacks against him. In the view of one ally who speaks to the former president every week, Trump wins in November if he sticks to talking about the economy, the border and crime. At the start of this week, that looked possible. Trump scheduled a string of rallies, in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona - each was themed to focus on exactly those political and economic topics. But with night after night of anti-Trump speeches here in Chicago, staying on message has gone out the window. And it's not what his supporters tell him they want anyway. The North Carolina event on Wednesday was vintage Trump - and it became a referendum on his own team's strategy. ""They always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy, don't get personal'... and yet [the Democrats are] getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?"" Trump asked. Then he polled the crowd: more policy or go personal? His fans roared, they wanted the Trump show, not a list of boring economic proposals. ""My advisers are fired!"" he joked. Then he said he'd stick to policy but couldn't let the attacks go unanswered. So the campaign strategy now seems to be at the whim of the candidate and the feedback of his crowds. That makes life difficult for his campaign advisers who repeatedly tell me their single biggest concern in this election campaign is whether they can keep Trump focused on issues and off the controversial personal attacks. There have been a couple of those this week already. Late on Wednesday night, Trump took to social media to criticise the Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who had given a rousing speech earlier in the evening. Trump clearly didn’t like what he heard. ""The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech,"" Trump wrote.  ""I have done more for Israel than any President…Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will."" The fact that he singled out Mr Shapiro as Jewish has not gone unnoticed. It was picked up on the US morning shows as an example of a racial dog whistle. After the Obamas criticised Trump at the DNC on Tuesday night, he responded during his rally in North Carolina, and, again, there was a similar racial innuendo. ""Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night,"" Trump said. ""He was taking shots at your president. And so was Michelle."" It's true that they did take pretty personal shots at him, but the use of Mr Obama's middle name has long been used to stoke racial animosity towards him. The problem for the Trump team is that their candidate thrives on controversy which then dominates headlines, and this distracts from their attempts to point out weaknesses in his opponent's policy positions. ""It doesn't matter what he talks about for 45 minutes,"" one adviser told me on the condition of anonymity. ""One comment or answer to a question gives the left all they need to change the subject.""

Trump and his running-mate JD Vance said they would support Mr Kennedy ending his campaign to align with their Republican ticket against Democratic nominees Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Mr Kennedy is due to ""address the nation"" from Phoenix in Arizona at 14:00 ET (19:00 BST) on Friday, a day after he filed to withdraw his candidacy in the state.   Trump is due to hold a rally in nearby Glendale hours later. His campaign said it would include a ""special guest"", and Trump told Fox News it was ""possible"" the pair would meet.   The ABC and NBC networks reported on Wednesday that Mr Kennedy would use his address on Friday to endorse Trump. CBS, the BBC's news partner in the US, quoted two sources as saying that he was ""considering ending his presidential candidacy"". Mr Kennedy's withdrawal from Arizona follows comments on Tuesday from his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, that he was considering joining forces with Trump. Mr Kennedy said soon after on X/Twitter that  ""as always, I am willing to talk with leaders of any political party to further the goals I have served for 40 years in my career and in this campaign."" Trump indicated he was open to the idea of joining forces with Mr Kennedy, telling CNN: ""If he is thinking about getting out, certainly I'd be open to it. He's a brilliant guy. He's a very smart guy."" Mr Vance said on Wednesday that it would be ""good"" if Mr Kennedy dropped out and joined forces with the former president. He clarified on Fox & Friends that he has not spoken to Mr Kennedy about the potential move.  Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, meanwhile told conservative radio host Glenn Beck that he would ""love the idea"" of Mr Kennedy joining a future Trump administration.  ""I love the idea of giving him some sort of role in some sort of major three-letter entity or whatever it may be and let him blow it up,"" he said. Mr Kennedy, 70, has faced a number of hurdles in his longshot campaign, from legal challenges over getting his name on state ballots to funding his run. Media reports over the last few months have indicated that he has offered to endorse Trump in exchange for a role in his next administration. A leaked phone call in July between the two candidates had Trump saying he would ""love"" Mr Kennedy ""to do something"" to support him. Ms Shanahan's comments to the Impact Theory podcast on Tuesday began the latest round of speculation. She said he was considering two options to combat the ""risk"" of a Harris presidency - dropping out and joining Trump, or staying in and forming a third party. She claimed the Democrats had ""planted insiders"" in their campaign, ""manipulated polls"" and ""sued us in every possible state"". ""There's two options that we're looking at and one is staying in, forming that new party, but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and [Tim] Walz presidency because we draw votes from Trump, or we draw somehow more votes from Trump,"" Ms Shanahan, 38, said. ""Or we walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump and you know, we walk away from that and we explain to our base why we’re making this decision."" She said it was ""not an easy decision"" but added that she trusted Trump more than Ms Harris with the future of the country. On the podcast, she rejected recent reports that the Kennedy campaign had been in talks with the Harris team about a potential endorsement or cabinet position. The Harris campaign chairwoman, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told Politico that she was not worried if Mr Kennedy endorsed Trump. ""We are very confident that [Ms Harris] is going to win whether she's running against one candidate or multiple candidates. I don't think it's really going to interfere with the race too much,"" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd73yed3p7no,Tim Walz’s wife clarifies their fertility treatment was not IVF,Tim Walz has made his story about IVF and his family's fertility woes a hallmark of Democratic campaign rallies.,21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The wife of US vice presidential candidate Tim Walz has clarified that she and her husband did not go through in vitro fertilization (IVF) after he repeatedly alluded to the fertility treatments on the campaign trail.  In an interview with Glamour, Gwen Walz said they went through intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatments to conceive their daughter, Hope.  Mr Walz has repeatedly brought up the personal story of the the couple's fertility woes on the campaign trail, while warning that Republicans want to restrict access to IVF and other reproductive rights for women.  During his first rally with presidential candidate Kamala Harris - which served as his introduction to many voters across the country - he talked about healthcare and the choice he believes each person has. ""That includes IVF"" he said, ""and this gets personal for me and my family"".  Ms Walz shared more about their journey to becoming parents with Glamour and said a neighbour, who was a nurse, helped administer ""the shots I needed as part of the IUI process"".  ""Our fertility journey was an incredibly personal and difficult experience,” she said. “Like so many who have experienced these challenges, we kept it largely to ourselves at the time.” She noted that their family decided to open up about the experience after seeing the attacks on fertility and reproductive rights, particularly in Alabama - where the state's Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos were legally considered children and led to fertility clinics across the state shutting. In turn, the state's legislature passed a measure protecting doctors from the legal ramifications of destroying unused embryos.  The line has become a point of contention with Republicans now accusing Mr Walz of lying.  Conservatives have also been attacking Mr Walz over his military record, claiming he was both overstating his service and retired before his unit was deployed overseas.  ""Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF,"" Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Who lies about something like that?"" Mr Walz has made the personal story a hallmark of the Democratic presidential campaign rallies, sharing the years he and his wife went through fertility treatments, waiting for good news from a doctor and eventually naming their daughter Hope. During one recent rally, the crowd started chanting his daughter's name, which made the Minnesota governor get emotional.  Mia Ehrenberg, a campaign spokeswoman, denied Mr Walz had been misleading. “Governor Walz talks how normal people talk,” she said. “He was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.” IUI consists of placing sperm directly into a woman's uterus and is known more commonly as artificial insemination.  It is sometimes tried as an alternative before the IVF process because it's less expensive, invasive and controversial.  IVF consists of additional steps and includes hormones being injected to force more egg production, which are retrieved and then combined with sperm to create embryos.  IVF has faced political scrutiny due to questions about unused embryos and their destruction, which some conservatives believe is the same as killing an unborn child. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w65xg7vy4o,Democrats reject Gaza protesters' demand to give speaking slot to Palestinian,The activists staged a sit-in outside the convention as Democrats ignored their requests.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democrats have rejected demands from demonstrators to allow a Palestinian to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Uncommitted delegates - who oppose US support of Israel's war in Gaza - began a sit-in protest just outside of the arena doors on Wednesday night.  But by 18:00 local time on Thursday - the deadline protesters had set to hear from Kamala Harris's campaign - activists said they had not received a response to their requests for a Palestinian to be allowed to take the stage. The sit-in protest on the final night of the convention came as thousands of demonstrators outside the perimeter continued to rally against the war in Gaza and White House policy. The demonstrations this week have been largely peaceful, except for a smaller, unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli consulate that led to 56 arrests.  ""This has been a disastrous decision by the Democratic leadership to deny a bare-minimum ask that we requested weeks ago, prior to the convention,"" said Layla Elabed, a co-leader of the uncommitted national movement. The Harris campaign told the BBC that campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez had met leaders from the uncommitted movement in recent days. ""There have been a number of speakers who have spoken about the war in Gaza and the need to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. You will continue to hear that message,"" a spokesperson said.  Uncommitted delegates were selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year. President Joe Biden won an overwhelming share of primary voters, but pro-Palestinian activists urged people to vote ""uncommitted"" and similar options in a number of states. Enough Democratic voters did so to send 30 delegates to the convention in Chicago, out of a total of more than 2,400 delegates. Israel's war in Gaza has divided the Democratic Party, but has largely been avoided as a topic of discussion during the DNC this week.  The uncommitted protesters said they had given the Harris campaign a list of several potential Palestinians who could speak at the conference.  The activists said the Harris campaign sent aides and lawmakers to the sit-in protest outside the arena on Wednesday night to try to resolve the conflict, but they refused to offer a speaking slot. Uncommitted activists said they were told that the focus of the convention was on the vice-president, as she prepared to give a speech that would be the ""biggest of her life"".  The delegates said they had been asking to have a Palestinian speaker address the crowd at the convention for two months.  ""We're going to have to have a lot of difficult conversations with the vice-president and her team after this,"" said Abbas Alawieh, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan. ""We're going to have to take stock of what happened.""  Despite the large protests outside the arena doors, the war in Gaza has been mentioned by only a handful of speakers throughout the four-day programme.  Mr Alawieh said the goal of having a Palestinian speaker at the convention was about ""forcing"" the Democratic Party to ""create space for talking about Palestinian human rights"".  Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, an outspoken critic of US support of Israel, told the BBC she was not surprised the topic has not been featured much during the convention. “Interestingly, foreign policy never really is a huge topic that’s talked about,” she said. “But I’ve always thought of foreign policy as domestic policy."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r9eqpynko,Oprah tells voters to 'choose truth' in surprise convention speech,"The TV star's unannounced speech hit back at Republican jibes at ""childless cat ladies"".",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Television icon Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in her hometown of Chicago, where she urged Democrats and independent voters to ""choose common sense over nonsense"". “Let us choose truth, let us choose honour, let us choose joy,” Winfrey told a cheering crowd on Wednesday. “Because that is the best of America.” Winfrey, who has avoided the political spotlight in recent years, lent some of her star power to Vice-President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz on the third night of the four-day convention. The 70-year-old's comments came before Mr Walz's primetime speech to accept formally the party's nomination for vice-president. Her endorsement of the pair helped to further energise the DNC - which has this week already hosted other famous faces such as rapper Lil Jon. In keeping with the tradition of party conventions, the Republicans, too, filled their own gathering last month with stardust. Musician Kid Rock and wrestler Hulk Hogan both made appearances.  As well as voicing a message of unity, former talk-show host Winfrey tacitly criticised the Republican challengers, former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance.  ""Despite what some would have you think, we are not so different from our neighbours,"" Winfrey said. ""When a house is on fire, we don't ask about the homeowner's race or religion, we don't wonder who their partner is or how they voted. No. We just try to do the best we can to save them."" In a slight directed at Mr Vance, she added: ""And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out, too."" The comments referred to a 2021 interview in which Mr Vance referred to Democratic politicians as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too"". The remarks, which went viral after Trump announced the Ohio senator as his running mate, were roundly criticised. Oprah does not have any children. The billionaire media mogul has shied away from politics in recent years. In 2007, she endorsed then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama's longshot bid for president. Winfrey, who considered Mr Obama a friend as the two overlapped in Chicago's political orbit, hosted fundraisers and volunteered for his campaign in Iowa.  But on Wednesday night, Winfrey cast herself as Independent, urging other like-minded voters to back Democrats in November.  ""You're looking at a registered Independent who's proud to vote again and again and again, because I'm an American, and that's what Americans do,"" she said. Tracy Prince and Kathy Sykes jumped out of their seats when they saw Oprah, who was born in their home state of Mississippi, take to the stage. “We love Oprah so much,” Mrs Sykes told BBC News. “Everyone in Mississippi is so proud that she claims us.” She said Oprah’s speech was a “powerful message” to independent voters in particular to vote for Ms Harris. “She gave very good reasons why - to choose common sense over nonsense,” Mrs Sykes said from the convention hall. Wednesday night also included several other celebrity cameos including Stevie Wonder, Mindy Kaling and Kenan Thompson. The Democratic Party is calling upon its famous supporters to help draw attention to their convention, hoping their presence will get voters to pay attention - and maybe cast a vote for Ms Harris in November. Previous research on celebrity endorsements has suggested that big-name figures are capable of generating publicity for a party, but it is less clear whether this translates into votes.  Studies have suggested that friends and family may have more influence on which way a person casts a ballot - and that in some circumstances, celebrities may even put off voters.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkmzr22y14o,Three things the Democrats have avoided so far at the DNC,"What they have tried to avoid says as much about their weaknesses as what they choose to highlight, writes Anthony Zurcher.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Modern political conventions tend to be slickly produced, carefully stage-managed events. And despite its struggles with staying on schedule and the unusual way its presidential nominee was chosen, this year’s Democratic gathering in Chicago has been no different. The Democrats on the convention stage have tried to put their best foot forward by talking about Kamala Harris’s qualifications and character, her plan for the economy and issues on which the party has broad public support, like abortion rights and healthcare. But what they don’t talk about – the issues and areas they have largely tried to avoid, at least so far – says as much about their electoral strategies and weakness as what they choose to highlight. Here are three notable omissions halfway through the party extravaganza. Four years ago, amidst the mass protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, the Democratic Party – and the nation as a whole – engaged in a sometimes animated debate about institutional racism and how American history is presented. While many mainstream Democrats avoided the aggressive calls to “defund the police”, most engaged in the discussion of how America could take steps to address what they viewed as the corrosive legacy of slavery in the nation’s businesses, classrooms and government, including by promoting DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion More recently, the issue of transgender rights has been an animating force among segments of the Democratic coalition – particularly in the face of Republican efforts to limit or prohibit the ability of children to receive gender care. Neither topic has received much attention in the Democratic convention arena so far. There was an emotional tribute to the civil rights movement early on Monday that culminated in a wheelchair-bound Jesse Jackson – who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s – taking the stage. But DEI and other remedies have received short shrift. “DEI has become a dog-whistle code” used to undermine minorities in powerful positions, said Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president of the National Council of Negro Women, which is organising voter outreach efforts in presidential battleground states. “Our country was founded on opportunities for all men and all women, but we're not hearing that now, because a lot of people don't want to alienate a certain base of folk that are afraid of this.” At this convention, alienating the fewest number of potential voters has been the name of the game. And while abortion rights have been a daily focus at the convention, transgender issues – the other hot-button social topic currently - have been largely ignored in the programming that makes national television. Ms Arline-Bradley warns that by not talking about questions of equity and inclusion, the problems will linger. “We should talk about them, because this party is the most inclusive and diverse party,” she said. “Show it, activate it and live by those values.” The last Democratic convention in 2020 was largely virtual – conducted in empty halls and television studios - due to the Covid pandemic. In 2016, when thousands of Democrats gathered in Philadelphia, the rifts within the party were on full display. Supporters of Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, who finished second behind Hillary Clinton for that year’s nomination, repeatedly disrupted the proceedings and organised protests around the convention hall. The party was divided on topics like universal healthcare, free college tuition and, more broadly, whether Democrats should rely on support from deep-pocketed donors, big business and what Mr Sanders labelled the “corporate oligarchy”. Those divisions still exist. Mr Sanders gave a speech Tuesday night railing against the corrupting influence of money in politics. But his speech was immediately followed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who bragged about being a billionaire, and venture capitalist and former American Express chief executive Ken Chenault. The big tent, at least for now, covered obvious differences of policy and opinion. Another current area of sharp divide within the party is US military support for Israel amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. Thousands of protesters have demonstrated outside the convention’s security perimeter, but the intense disagreements have received little attention inside the convention hall. Mr Sanders received applause when he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and Joe Biden turned some heads when he said in his speech on Monday that protesters “have a point” when they say there have been too many civilian deaths. But all this is a far cry from 2016, when some antiwar convention attendees booed former four-star General John Allen and former Secretary of Defence and CIA Director Leon Panetta during their speeches. Ever since undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border surged early in the Biden presidency, the subject of immigration has been a liability for Democrats. Republicans have blamed the administration’s policies for encouraging the historic rise in border incursions, and the flood of new arrivals – many of whom have been transported by conservative governors to populous Democratic cities – has strained public services. The Harris campaign appears to recognise her vulnerability on the issue. One of its first television adverts blamed Donald Trump for sinking bipartisan border-security legislation earlier this year and touted Ms Harris’s record prosecuting “transnational gangs, the drug cartels and the human traffickers” while she was California’s attorney general. But immigration appears to be an issue the Harris team would rather talk about in 50-second television adverts than from the stage in Chicago. The topic has got a few lines here and there, but compared to the 2020 convention – when Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration was a primary focus of attack – the silence has been conspicuous. Reports suggest this could change on Wednesday night, with some speakers due to address the issue."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74lwnxxxzjo,Riots show how the UK's far right has changed,"No single group owned or organised the recent riots - they were bigger than that, says Daniel De Simone.",21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Three weeks on from the start of the riots, many of us are still trying to make sense of their impact. Will the disorder come to be seen as a one-off outburst quickly faced down by the public and police, or as a display of power by a newly dangerous far right? The murders in Southport of Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice da Silva Aguiar and Bebe King were seized upon by extremists, who exploited the tragedy to promote their own hatreds and agendas. Online lies and misinformation inflamed the situation and some key instigators used social media and messaging apps to spread hatred and call for protests at fixed times and places. The result was a series of violent flash mobs, spanning over several days, with racial and religious hatred the central animating motive. Mobs attacked hotels housing migrants, tried to set the buildings alight and pulled people from their cars. The riots have been characterised as “far right” by public figures from the prime minister downwards. For many people, this description suggests the disorder was somehow organised by named, specific, formal groups or political parties; and the far right’s history of protest and violence by organisations like the National Front reinforces this idea. As someone who has spent years investigating right-wing extremism, I keep being asked who organised the chaos, as if there is one simple answer. But the recent disorder is more complex and has laid bare the anarchy of modern right-wing extremism, as well as the extent of its reach. The truth is that no one organisation owned or organised the riots: they were bigger than that. This lack of cohesion makes the situation more unpredictable and dangerous. For the authorities, there are so many potential rioters and potential targets, and a lack of obvious national organisations to disrupt. By contrast, counter-demonstrations by anti-racism campaigners have been far more cohesive and organised. Right-wing extremism itself can be thought of as a spectrum, rather than a coherent whole. It includes genocidal neo-Nazis treated as terrorists by the state, who hide behind online aliases, scorn campaigning, want to destroy society and venerate Adolf Hitler. But the term is also used to describe people who stand in democratic elections, engage in public campaigns and put forward policy platforms. I tend to use “extreme right” for the first type and “far right” for the latter.  In key respects, right-wing extremism in the UK today has moved beyond being driven mainly by organisations and parties to instead being composed of looser networks of people, typically coalescing online. There is no neo-fascist political party achieving electoral success in the way the British National Party (BNP) did in the recent past. Today, there are no prominent political leaders as we’d traditionally understand them, either. The anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is probably the best-known public figure - but the convicted criminal oversees a personality cult rather than a coherent movement, with the endless spectacle of his online diatribes and legal issues providing a living soap opera. Groups like the BNP and National Front still exist, but they are ghosts of their former selves, populated by older fascists and lacking appeal to younger people. Newer, more extreme organisations have been created by younger people in the UK but the key examples - including the neo-Nazi groups National Action and Sonnenkrieg Division – have been outlawed by the government as terrorist organisations and disrupted by anti-fascists, journalists and the police. Some right-wing extremists have moved away from setting up formal groups that draw attention from the police and have instead sought to create looser networks, particularly online, where anyone can follow extremist channels or influencers. For instance, some have formed in small groups like Patriotic Alternative (PA) and a network of fighting clubs in which white men meet to engage in violent training. These have adopted less overtly extreme rhetoric than organisations that have been banned, but contain similar people, and some PA members have been convicted of terrorism and racial hatred offences. When violence occurs, it does not always come from the neo-Nazi end of the spectrum, nor are those responsible necessarily long-term extremists. Most of those who took part in the disorder had no known links to the extreme or far right. There were a range of people involved, from people in their late 60s to children, with a range of different motivations. Some were opportunistic criminals who took part in looting and stealing. Others were drunk and joined in after the chaos had started. However, some of those at the riots did have links to the extreme right. These include John Honey, who had attended PA events in the past and was jailed for his part in what Judge John Thackray described as ""12 hours of racist, hate-fuelled mob violence"" in Hull.  Present at the Southport riot was Matthew Hankinson, who had been released from prison only months earlier after being jailed for membership of the banned terrorist group National Action. While the violence in the wake of the Southport tragedy has largely died down, its impact is still being felt. Now, after the riots, people from across the spectrum of right-wing extremism have seen they can help cause a national crisis and are likely to try to seize on any future tragedy in a similar way. Those involved in extremist movements may conclude there is a broader audience for their beliefs than is suggested by their groups’ membership numbers. The main targets for rioters – Muslims and services used by migrants – have been demonised for years by some public figures as well as by fringe activists. This summer’s disorder was not the first outbreak of violence. There had already been a series of plots and attacks by lone individuals, classed as terrorism by police, before the riots: at an immigration solicitors’ office in London, a hotel believed to be used by migrants in Worcestershire and a migrant processing centre in Dover. Darren Osborne, who killed Makram Ali during the 2017 Finsbury Park van attack, had been swiftly radicalised online by far-right anti-Islam beliefs, including those espoused by Tommy Robinson. Osborne didn’t belong to any group and was unknown to the security services. The incident was formally declared a terrorist attack by the judge, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb. She told Osborne that being on Twitter had “exposed you to a great deal of extreme racist and anti-Islamic ideology” and that “you allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claim to be leaders”.  Seven years on, the riots have reinforced the same point: you do not have to be a neo-Nazi, or in a group, to be exposed to far-right ideas and conspiracy theories - you just have to be online. So far, no-one involved in the riots has been charged with a terrorism offence, nor have prosecutors argued that any of the many charges of violent disorder have a terrorist motive. The Crown Prosecution Service, however, says the possibility remains under consideration. The former head of counter-terror policing, Neil Basu, has said he thinks some of the actions did cross the “line into terrorism”.  Prosecutors and police can formally link violent disorder to terrorism. In the past week, when several activists from Palestine Action were charged with violent disorder after an alleged attack on a factory in Gloucestershire owned by an Israeli arms company, the CPS alleged there was a “terrorist connection” to the incident. The hundreds of arrests and charges linked to the riots have shown the legal consequences of taking part. That is likely to make some people think again before joining a riot in future. In that sense, therefore, right-wing extremism has been put on the back foot. However, its supporters also view the state’s response as evidence of one of their central theses: that far-right activists are disproportionally targeted compared to people with different backgrounds and ideologies. This narrative is taking hold in many places, including on X – formerly Twitter – where billionaire owner Elon Musk has promoted it himself. One possible conclusion to be drawn from the burst of violence this summer is that far-right narratives are now more mainstream than many would like to think. Is there now a far-right culture that is more prevalent in society and which transcends the need to organise in political groups? If so, activists may feel emboldened by what’s happened over these past weeks and the risk of violence potentially could be even greater. When reflecting this week, I thought back to a cold day in Preston in early January 2018. I was in court watching a defendant called Jack Renshaw, who was giving evidence in a trial that saw him convicted of stirring up racial hatred in antisemitic speeches. By the end of that year – and two further trials – he was also convicted of sexually grooming young boys and planning to kill his local MP with a machete in a neo-Nazi terror attack. I checked my notes and, yes, my memory had been correct. Renshaw, an admitted neo-Nazi and former member of the BNP and National Action, was asked why he engaged in racist activism. In response, he said it helped change politics for everyone. “It makes mainstream politics more right wing,” he told the court. The reaction of the public, police and courts to the riots has shown how most people do not share the violent hatreds and fantasies of the far and extreme right. But many others will feel a UK of far-right flash mobs is more scary, unpredictable and racist than they believed and wonder what the future holds. This remains a dangerous moment.

She flew into O'Hare airport on Air Force Two after a day of campaigning in the swing state of Pennsylvania with her running mate, Tim Walz. Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, held a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Ms Harris is expected to join President Biden on stage when he addresses the convention on Monday.  Pennsylvania has been a crucial battleground in recent presidential races, with Donald Trump winning the state in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. A new CBS News poll shows Mr Trump and Ms Harris are neck and neck in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In a speech on Sunday, Ms Harris indirectly criticised her opponent, suggesting he was a ""coward"" whose politics focused on putting down rivals. ""What we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,"" she told a crowd of supporters.  ""Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward."" A day earlier in the same state, Mr Trump called his Democratic rival a ""lunatic"" and bragged that he was ""much better looking"" than her.  Ms Harris arrived in Chicago on Sunday ahead of the Democratic National Convention, where delegates will recognise her as the nominee for the 5 November election. The convention will culminate on Thursday with Ms Harris giving a primetime speech after she formally accepts the party's nomination. Security around the venue is tight ahead of the four-day event, with tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters expected to rally in Chicago. "

John Kent, a Labour councillor, spoke out after Thurrock Council served legal papers on a Dubai-based businessman in an attempt to recover £150m of taxpayers cash.  The authority faces debts of around £1.2bn following a series of failed investments and is having to be supported by government funding.  Mr Kent said: ""We need to see an independent inquiry. I think there are members of Thurrock Council who have a lot of questions to answer."" A High Court lawsuit was served by the council on businessman Liam Kavanagh and investment company Rockfire Capital Ltd this week, after they tracked him down in Dubai. The council said it was ""deliberately misled"" by Mr Kavanagh over the value of investments and that millions of pounds funded his ""lavish lifestyle"" and paid for a private jet, a yacht and a country estate in Hampshire. The issue of debt began for the council in 2016, when it started to invest money in renewable energy schemes, including a £24m solar farm in Swindon. Mr Kent added: ""We will leave no stone unturned as we pursue these claims as vigorously as possible. We are looking forward to our day in court."" Residents have been left to pick up the bill, as council tax was raised by 8% and non-essential services cut.  Mr Kent, who took over as council leader after Labour won in the local elections in May, added: ""The situation is awful. The people of Thurrock are going to be paying the price of council tax being higher than it needs to be and services being poorer then they should be. ""But I am absolutely committed to righting the ship and getting the finances under control once and for all."" The BBC has been unable to reach Mr Kavanagh for comment.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj08mn24jplo,Key moments when Harris and Obama's political paths crossed,"Two decades after they first met, he will use his convention speech to try to propel her to the White House.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former President Barack Obama will return to the Democratic National Convention stage in his hometown of Chicago to deliver the keynote address on Tuesday, 20 years after his convention debut thrust him into the national spotlight. It’s a tricky moment for one of the party’s most popular figures. He will use his speech to touch on the historic nature of Kamala Harris’s candidacy – the first female of colour to lead the ticket – as a continuation of his legacy. But he must also pay tribute to his own vice-president and the man responsible for her rise – President Joe Biden. Mr Obama, 63, and Ms Harris, 59, have moved in overlapping political orbits as early as his days as an Illinois state senator running for the US Senate. The two, both on the rise in their nascent political careers, met at a California fundraiser in 2004.  As an early supporter, Ms Harris would later volunteer for his presidential campaign and help power his first victory in 2008. Buoyed by party enthusiasm for Ms Harris’s campaign, Mr Obama - and his popular wife Michelle Obama - will try to return the favour and help propel her to the Oval Office. “I think he can excite people about her and about the stakes [of the election] and I think that’s what he intends to do today,” David Plouffe, Mr Obama’s 2008 campaign manager and a now Harris campaign adviser, told Axios. Here’s a look at key moments in their two-decade relationship. Ms Harris, then a San Francisco district attorney, was in the crowd of more than 15,000 people as then-junior senator announced his longshot bid for the White House on the steps of the Old State Capitol in the Illinois capital city of Springfield in February 2007. She would go on to knock on doors and raise money for Mr Obama ahead of the Iowa caucuses in 2008, later serving as his California campaign co-chair. Mr Obama lent her some of his national star power two years later when she mounted a statewide bid for attorney general against Republican Steve Cooley, a popular Los Angeles district attorney. She had been affectionately referred to as “the female Barack Obama” by longtime PBS News anchor Gwen Ifill, but remained locked in a tight contest. Mr Obama, who would endure widespread congressional losses in that election year, made time to appear at a Los Angeles rally in October 2010 in which he referred to Ms Harris as “dear, dear friend of mine”. “I want everybody to do right by her,” he told the crowd. Ms Harris eked out a victory by less than a percentage point, setting her on a path toward higher office. Mr Obama gave Ms Harris a coveted speaking role at the 2012 Democratic National Convention for his re-election. She had already made a name for herself in California in barrier-breaking roles as the first person of colour or woman to serve as San Francisco's district attorney. She was also the first African American and South Asian American elected as the state's top lawyer. But as attorney general, she had made headlines for standing firm in negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and the banks responsible for the foreclosure crisis, securing more than $25 billion on behalf of homeowners. She spoke of her accomplishment, weaving in her personal story, praising Mr Obama for standing up for Americans during the housing crisis and attacking his Republican challenger Mitt Romney as an ally of Wall Street. ""We need to move forward."" she said in her speech, a phrase she has reprised in her 2024 campaign. ""President Obama will fight for working families. He will fight to level the economic playing field and fight to give every American the same fair shot my family had."" Her high-profile remarks came just before former President Bill Clinton, landing a spot that was guaranteed to catch the attention of national Democrats, powerbrokers and key donors.  Though Mr Obama quietly supported Ms Harris as she rose through California politics, he raised eyebrows in 2013 when he referred to her as ""the best looking attorney general in the country"". “You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you’d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,” the president said at a San Francisco fundraiser. “She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country.” He phoned Ms Harris hours later to apologise for the comment.  ""They are old friends and good friends and he did not want in any way to diminish"" her accomplishments, White House spokesman Jay Carney later told reporters. At the height of his Democratic power in 2016, finishing his second term as president, Mr Obama waded into the contentious California Senate race to endorse Ms Harris, who launched a bid to replace retiring Senator Barbara Boxer. In July of that year, he and Vice-President Joe Biden formally announced their support for Ms Harris, who was running against fellow Democrat and US Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez. In California's primary system, the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party.  ""Kamala is a lifelong courtroom prosecutor with only one client: the people of the State of California. That’s the approach she’ll take to the United States Senate,"" Mr Obama said in a statement released by the Harris campaign.  Mr Biden said he had known her through his son Beau Biden, who forged a friendship with Ms Harris as Delaware's attorney general during their mortgage settlement negotiations.  Ms Harris handily won the election, and became only the second black female to serve in the US Senate. Ms Harris' 2020 presidential primary bid began as a spectacle, launched in her hometown of Oakland, California, before a crowd of 20,000 people in 2019. Like others in the crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, she met with Mr Obama to lay out her case for her candidacy.  But Mr Obama, whose own vice-president was mounting an election bid, wanted to stay out of the political fray and wait until the party selected its nominee before offering his coveted endorsement.  Ms Harris's campaign collapsed in less than a year, and Joe Biden would offer her a political reprieve as his running mate. Mr Obama reportedly supported Mr Biden's selection of Ms Harris, despite their early debate clash over the former vice-president's record on school desegregation. Mr Obama said his former vice-president ""nailed this decision"" in selecting Ms Harris.  ""Choosing a vice-president is the first important decision a president makes. When you're in the Oval Office, weighing the toughest issues, and the choice you make will affect the lives and livelihoods of the entire country — you need someone with you who's got the judgement and the character to make the right call,"" Mr Obama said in a statement at the time.  Since 2020, Mr Obama has been in regular touch with Ms Harris, providing counsel and serving as a sounding board whenever she's asked.  The Obamas waited several days to endorse Ms Harris until it was clear that there were no challengers and she was the party's choice. The couple released a video of them calling her to formally announce their support for her campaign. “We’ve known each other for 20 years. I’ve watched how you have excelled in every position you’ve been in,” Mr Obama told her in the phone call. “Just to see all that hard work be recognised is something that we couldn’t be more thrilled about. And so the main thing we wanted to do was just let you know and let Doug [Emhoff] know, our soon-to-be first gentleman, that we are gonna do everything we can to help propel you into the presidency.” Over the last few months, the two have been in close contact as Mr Obama has sought to offer support for her campaign, including policy or strategic advice, fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. Ms Harris has also relied on many of Mr Obama’s old hands to help run her campaign. Eric Holder, who served as Mr Obama’s attorney general, led efforts to vet Ms Harris’s shortlist for vice-president, while Mr Plouffe is now serving as one of her most senior advisers.  The Harris campaign has also enlisted other Obama aides including Jennifer O’Malley Dillion, her campaign chairwoman, and senior adviser Stephanie Cutter. Former Obama communications director Jennifer Palmieri is also helping Ms Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c785n2n9334o,Six Kamala Harris claims fact-checked,"BBC Verify examined claims made by Harris, about her record and Trump's on the economy, abortion and immigration.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris has been holding rallies across the US as she campaigns against Donald Trump, and will appear in Milwaukee on Tuesday ahead of her headline speech at the Democratic National Convention later in the week. She has made a series of claims contrasting their records on the economy, healthcare, abortion and immigration. BBC Verify has been examining them.  CLAIM: “Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.” VERDICT: This is misleading. In this campaign, Trump has said repeatedly he would not do this, although he has suggested he would in the past. Social Security provides a source of income when you retire or if you cannot work due to a disability. Medicare is a US government programme which provides healthcare coverage for millions of Americans who are retired or disabled. “I will not cut 1 cent from Social Security or Medicare,” Trump said at a rally on 5 August. And in his 20 point policy platform, one of the pledges is: “Fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts.” However, during his time as president Trump proposed several budgets which would have cut elements of Medicare, such as eliminating the programme advising recipients how to sign up for benefits. None of these budget proposals was enacted. He also has made comments about cutting Social Security in the past. In an interview in March this year, on entitlement programs such as Social Security Trump said: ""There’s a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting."" However, he later clarified the comments, saying: “I will never do anything that will hurt or jeopardise Social Security or Medicare.” CLAIM: “Inflation is down under 3%.” VERDICT: That figure is correct but some context is needed here.  Inflation, which is the increase in the price of something over time, is down from a peak of 9.1% under the Biden administration and it is higher than when Mr Trump left office.  When President Biden took office in January 2021, inflation was 1.4% but it rose significantly during the first two years of his administration. This trend is comparable with many Western countries which saw high inflation in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues as a consequence of Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. While the Biden administration had limited control over these external factors, some economists say that their 2021 American Rescue Plan, worth $1.9tn (£1.5tn), also contributed to rising prices.  CLAIM: “We have created 16 million new jobs.” VERDICT: That is roughly correct. 15.8 million jobs have been added under the Biden administration, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, when the Biden government entered the White House in January 2021, the US was recovering from the Covid pandemic, which crippled the economy and during which more than 20 million jobs were lost. “Many of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,” says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. Since President Biden came into office, job growth has been strong, surpassing the pre-pandemic levels seen under Trump. However, weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they have since stabilised. CLAIM: “He froze in the face of the COVID crisis. He drove our economy into the ground.” VERDICT: The US economy did take a big hit during the pandemic, like most countries, but it also bounced back under Trump. You can see from the graph above that there was a dramatic collapse in economic growth in the US during the Covid pandemic. However following the pandemic, the US economy bounced back under Trump. He implemented a series of measures to help it recover, including financial assistance for small businesses. During Trump’s four years in office (Jan 2017- Jan 2021), the average annual growth rate of the US economy was 2.3%. Under the Biden administration, this figure has been 2.2% - so almost the same.  CLAIM: ""We had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades but Donald Trump tanked the deal."" VERDICT: Trump was publicly against the Biden administration's immigration bill, but voting on it was up to Congress. The immigration bill aimed to tighten asylum standards, increase spending on Border Patrol, and allow for the automatic closure of the southern border to illegal crossings if a certain daily threshold was reached. It failed to pass a vote in February with the majority of lawmakers in the US Senate opposing it. Trump did not have a vote as he was not an elected official at the time, but he did call for his Republican allies to oppose it. Trump also took credit when the bill failed, saying it was “horrendous” as he thought it was not tough enough on immigration. At a Fox News event in February 2024, he said he was against the deal as passing it would have “made it much better for the opposing side”. The bill was blocked in the Senate for a second time in May. CLAIM: “In more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest... be sure if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban"" VERDICT: Bans were enacted by states after Trump left office but, as president, he appointed three justices to the Supreme Court who voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Trump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban.  Roe v. Wade protected the federal Constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years until it was overturned in June 2022. As a result, 22 states currently ban abortion or restrict the procedure to earlier in pregnancy than was set by Roe v. Wade. In 14 of those states, abortion is banned in almost all circumstances with 10 not even making an exception for rape or incest. During his campaign, he has declined to back a national abortion ban and said he believes the issue should be left to individual states. Additional reporting by Gerry Georgieva.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4xwkl2lewo,"Night three at the DNC: Oprah, 'cat ladies' and coach Walz","The Democratic National Convention's third night in Chicago featured a folksy 'coach' Tim Walz, Oprah Winfrey and a host of other big names.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Tim Walz was formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for vice-president at the party's convention in Chicago on Wednesday night - where delegates also delighted in a surprise speech about freedom from Oprah Winfrey. Minnesota Democrats were the last to leave the United Center after their state governor worked the room with a folksy ""pep talk"" inspired by his love of American football. His proud son Gus could also be seen giving a tearful reaction. The night also played host to Democratic grandees such as former President Bill Clinton and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as rising party stars including Josh Shapiro, the governor of the key swing state of  Pennsylvania.  In case you missed the convention's third night, here are some of the highlights. Governor Walz gave a brief speech to formally accept the nomination as his party's vice-presidential candidate - and tapped into his favourite sport. ""I haven't given a lot of big speeches like this, but I have given a lot of pep talks,"" he told a cheering crowd. The former high-school American football coach went on to use pitchside metaphors to try to stir the passions of Democrats and moderates alike. He portrayed his side as the underdogs in the presidential match: ""It's the fourth quarter, we're down a field goal, but we're on offence and we've got the ball. We're driving down the field, and boy do we have the right team."" Members of Mr Walz's old team brought the metaphor to life by donning their old jerseys and rushing to join him on stage, as the horns and drums of a marching band played in the background.  Mr Walz's remarks were a folksy pitch to middle America. He also spoke about his experience as a teacher, his lifelong love of hunting and his family's fertility struggles.  He relied on phrases that have become hits with Democratic devotees. One of them - ""when we fight, we win"" - was chanted by the room like a sports crowd. Wednesday night was another family affair at the DNC - with scenes reminiscent of an appearance by Donald Trump and JD Vance with their wives and relatives at the equivalent Republican gathering last month. Mr Walz described his wife Gwen and children Hope and Gus as his ""entire world"" - a remark that got Gus on his feet, shouting through tears: ""That's my dad."" Ahead of the convention, Mr and Mrs Walz spoke to People magazine about their ""brilliant"" 17-year-old son, saying he had a learning disorder, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and an anxiety disorder - saying these conditions gave him a ""super power"". Ms Harris's family also had a prominent role. Tony West, her brother-in-law, spoke about how they met in law school, and how Ms Harris had gone on to fight for her family - saying this she would do this for voters if they elected her president. It was a message echoed by Harris's niece and two nephews - Alexander Hudlin, Jasper Empoff and Arden Emhoff, who appears on stage to say ""auntie"" would be a president for ""all of us"". Hudlin said Ms Harris calmed his fears as a nine-year-old when Trump won the presidency in 2016. She told him: ""You know what superheroes do? They fight back."" The crowd erupted when media mogul Oprah Winfrey stepped in front of the DNC podium, making a surprise appearance dressed in a purple pantsuit.  Invoking the words of civil rights leader John Lewis and the lyrics of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land, the long-time TV host told the audience that ""America is an ongoing project"" requiring ""hard work and heart work"". Winfrey spoke on the abortion bans in Republican states as an example of a loss of freedom. She said to loud applause: ""If you cannot control when and how you choose to bring your children into this world and how they are raised and supported, there is no American dream."" While speaking about the principles of unity and neighbourly values, she provided the metaphor of a house on fire - saying the right thing to do was to save its inhabitants, even if one of them was a ""childless cat lady"". The comments referred to a 2021 interview in which Mr Vance disparaged Democratic politicians as “a bunch of childless cat ladies"". She was not the only celebrity who lent their support to the Democratic cause on Wednesday. Soul legend Stevie Wonder took to the podium and then the piano - and was followed on the keys by John Legend who sang a rendition of Prince's Let's Go Crazy.  There were also some moments of levity unrelated to politics. Comedian Mindy Kaling somehow shoehorned in a joke about Ben Affleck's divorce from Jennifer Lopez. Former President Bill Clinton delivered his 12th straight convention speech – a tradition that dates back to 1980 and spans the period he won two White House terms in the 1990s. He received a warm welcome from the Democratic faithful, even if it was not at the levels seen for another former president, Barack Obama, on Tuesday night. ""In 2024, we have a clear choice: 'We The People' versus 'Me, myself, and I,’"" the 78-year-old said, alluding to Trump. ""I know which one I like better for our country.” Clinton, who was famously born in the small Arkansas town of Hope and later became that state’s governor, echoed a warning made by the Obamas last night - saying that Democrats should not be “overconfident”. ""One of the reasons that President-to-be Harris is doing so well is that we're all so happy,"" he added. ""But you should never underestimate your opponent."" Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has earned credit for helping to convince President Joe Biden to leave the 2024 White House race - as well as some heat. But the crowd at the United Center did not appear to meet her with animosity. The senior Democrat began her speech with gratitude for Mr Biden.  “Thank you, Joe,” the 84-year-old said, after listing the president's legislative accomplishments. Despite reports of bad blood between Mr Biden and Mrs Pelosi, the president used his own DNC speech earlier this week to deny that he was upset with those who called on him to step aside in this year's election. Mrs Pelosi did not wade any further into the controversy, and spent much of her remaining remarks singing the praises of Ms Harris and remarking on Trump's role in stirring in the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y87l6rx5wo,Trump falsely implies Taylor Swift endorses him,"Taylor Swift has yet to weigh in on the 2024 election, but endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump appears to have falsely implied he has Taylor Swift's endorsement, posting fake images on social media of the singer and her fans supporting him. The Republican presidential candidate posted the message ""I accept!"" alongside the images, which were taken from other social media accounts. Many appear to have been created using artificial intelligence.  The post sparked a backlash among Swift's fans, known as Swifties, who accused Trump of spreading misinformation. The singer has not endorsed a candidate in the 2024 election but backed the Democrats in 2020 and criticised Trump while he was president. One of the photos shared by Trump depicted Swift fans wearing t-shirts that read: ""Swifties for Trump"".  The post appeared to have a label of ""satire"" with a headline that read: ""Swifties turning to Trump after ISIS foiled Taylor Swift concert"".  Swift recently cancelled three concerts in Vienna following a possible security threat. Police arrested two people on suspicion of planning attacks inspired by the Islamic State group. Another re-posted photo mimicked a World War One US army recruiting poster, which replaced Uncle Sam's face with Swift's and read: ""Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump"".  NBC News reported two of the images Trump re-posted feature real women who are Trump supporters.  Swift supported the Democratic Party in the 2020 election, and criticised Trump during the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd. ""After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?,"" she posted on Twitter/X. ""We will vote you out in November."" Earlier this year, the BBC discovered dozens of deepfakes portraying black people supporting Trump. There was no evidence linking the images to Trump's campaign.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8xqy0jv24o,New homes and end to price-gouging: Harris sets economic goals,Vice-president Kamala Harris targets housing costs and price gouging in newly-released economic plans.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris has called for millions of new-build homes and first-time buyer help, tax breaks for families and a ban on grocery ""price-gouging"" in her first speech focused on economic policy. The Democratic presidential nominee's plans build on ideas from the Biden administration and aim at addressing voter concerns after a surge in prices since 2021.  Many of the proposals would require action from Congress, where similar ideas have stalled in the past.  Donald Trump said the vice-president had already had more than three years with the administration to deliver her promises, which his campaign called ""dangerously liberal"".  ""Where has she been and why hasn't she done it?"" he asked.  Ms Harris hit back in a speech on Friday in North Carolina, stating: ""I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look at who they fight for. ""Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations. I will fight to give money back to working and middle class Americans."" The campaign's proposals include a ""first-ever"" tax credit for builders of homes sold to first-time buyers, as well as up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance for ""eligible"" first time buyers, a move that her campaign estimated could reach four million households over four years.  She has also called for capping the monthly price of diabetes-drug insulin at $35 for everyone, finding ways to cancel medical debt, and giving families a $6,000 tax credit the year they have a new child.  She is supporting a federal law banning firms from charging excessive prices on groceries and urged action on a bill in Congress that would bar property owners from using services that ""coordinate"" rents. Democrats and their allies are hoping Ms Harris will prove a more forceful and trusted messenger than President Joe Biden on economic pain. Robert Weissman, the co-president of the consumer watchdog Public Citizen, characterised Ms Harris's plans as a ""pro-consumer, anti-corporate abuse agenda"". ""The [Biden] administration did talk about it but they did not promote proposed measures anywhere near as aggressive as Harris is doing,"" he said. But pollster Micah Roberts, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies, said inflation was likely to remain a challenge for Democrats, noting that voters have a long history of trusting Trump - and Republicans - more on economic issues. ""Trump's been holding the advantage on this stuff for like a year plus,"" said Mr Roberts, the Republican half of a bipartisan team that recently conducted a survey on economic issues for CNBC, which found that Trump still held a big lead over Ms Harris on the topic. Without a huge change, he said it would be ""hard for me to believe"" that the margin had suddenly closed. Though analysts say some of Harris's proposals, such as the ban on price-gouging, are likely to be popular, they have also sparked criticism from some economists. Bans on price-gouging already exist in many states, applied during emergencies such as hurricanes. But economists say the term is difficult to define and widening such rules could end up backfiring, by discouraging firms from making more at times of short supply.  Michael Salinger, a professor of markets, public policy and law at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, said a similar ban was discussed when he served as the lead economist at the Federal Trade Commission during the administration of George W Bush.  ""I thought then that it was a bad idea and I think now that it's a bad idea,"" he said. ""To impose controls on competitive markets will lead to shortages - that's always been our experience."" He said the Harris campaign's other plans would also face questions, given their cost.   For example, the proposal to increase the tax credit for children to as much as $3,600, which Congress did temporarily during the pandemic and opted against extending, would cost more than $1tn, according to some estimates.  With populism ascendant in both parties, that cost has not dissuaded Trump's choice for vice president, JD Vance, from backing an even bigger tax credit expansion.  Prof Salinger said Trump's other economic plans would be unlikely to tackle inflation concerns. Economists predict that increased drilling would have limited impact given the global nature of energy markets and have warned that Trump's pledge to impose a tax of 10% or more on imports would drive up prices.  As it stands, price increases have been subsiding, as the shocks from pandemic-era supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine fade. Inflation, which tracks the pace of price increases, was 2.9% in July, the smallest annual increase since March 2021, the Labor Department said this week.  That is getting closer to the 2% pace considered normal, though prices are up roughly 20% since January 2021. ""The problem that people object to is that even if inflation is down, the prices are still higher and that's true but they're higher because of the natural working of market forces,"" Prof Salinger said. ""Trying to stand in the way of the working of market forces is a lot like trying to stop the tides,"" he added. ""You just can't do it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dp6veej7do,Five takeaways from the Democratic Convention's first night,"President Biden, Hillary Clinton, and the next generation of Democratic leaders took the stage in Chicago to make the case for Kamala Harris.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Democratic National Convention’s first night featured an unusual send off, as it came just a month after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his former running mate - Kamala Harris. Ms Harris broke with tradition and spoke at the start of the convention to voice her gratitude for her boss. ""I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden,"" she said. The evening showcased a range of speakers, from Olympic gold medal-winning basketball coach Steve Kerr to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But Mr Biden gave the prime-time address. He praised Ms Harris's leadership and promising that America's best days were ""before us.""  Here is a look back at the night's most memorable moments. Only four weeks ago, President Biden had every intention of closing the Democratic convention and watching a slate of speakers spend this week praising his administration.  But after a wild month for US politics, Biden instead spoke as a surrogate for his former running mate - a job he fulfilled at Chicago's United Center on the opening night of the convention.  Despite the change of fortune, Mr Biden was greeted by minutes of uninterrupted applause from a crowd of thousands. They chanted “Thank you Joe!” for his time in office and for his decision to pass the torch to Ms Harris. The loud and lasting cheers brought tears to Mr Biden’s eyes, after he hugged daughter Ashley Biden, who introduced him to the convention. He then gave a 50-minute speech, touting his administration's accomplishments and speaking about the threat that Republican nominee Donald Trump poses.  This speech could be one of the last the president gives in front of a crowd that size and with cheers that thunderous. The loudest applause line came near the end when he told the audience: ""America, America, I gave my best to you."" While the first night of the DNC featured some of the Democratic Party’s most seasoned leaders, including Mr Biden and Ms Clinton, much of the programme was dedicated to ushering in a new generation of Democrats. Several of the party’s rising stars were featured throughout the evening, including Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Monday appeared to serve as a means to pass the political torch from one generation to another and heal any perceived wounds that occurred over a difficult month for Democrats.  Several of the lawmakers who took the stage on Monday - including Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Delaware Senator Chris Coons - had advocated for Mr Biden to stay in the race just a few weeks ago.  But each one spoke about being all in for Ms Harris.  “Kamala Harris is for the middle class because she is from the middle class,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez told the convention in her first major party convention speech. Others who worked to push out Mr Biden from the presidential race - such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - cheered him on during his speech.  Thousands of demonstrators gathered in Chicago on Monday to protest the Biden administration’s support of Israel’s war in Gaza, but the issue received little mention during the first night of speeches at the DNC. While pro-Palestinian organisers saw smaller numbers than the “tens of thousands” they orginially expected, the demonstration outside the United Center proved to be energetic enough to break through a security barricade - leading to 13 arrests.  The demonstrators received one brief acknowledgement from Mr Biden during his speech on Monday night. He said that the Chicago protestors “have a point”, though he added that many innocent people were killed “on both sides”. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israel’s war in Gaza has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, while about 1,200 Israelis have been killed, according to their government. There are additional protests planned for the rest of the week at the DNC. Asked whether any Palestinians would be able to voice their concerns on the convention stage, a Harris campaign spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday that they did not have any scheduling updates. Labour was a prominent theme on Monday night - even Mr Biden labelled himself the most pro-labour president in American history.  But perhaps one of the most memorable lines of the night came from United Automobile Workers President Shawn Fain, who took the podium and called Trump a “scab” - someone who undermines organised workers. The insult - which was also featured on Mr Fain’s shirt - was met with an eruption of applause from the audience. Mr Fain was just one of several labour leaders to pledge support for Ms Harris at the DNC on Monday. Others included AFL-CIO President Elizabeth Shuler - a major union leader - and Brent Booker, the president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. Missing from the stage was Teamsters President Sean O'Brien, who gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. After much backlash, the Teamsters president requested a speaking slot at the DNC - but he did not obtain one.  In a speech that echoed remarks she gave at her own DNC nomination just eight years ago, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the crowd Ms Harris would be the first to break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US. Ms Clinton made her own unsuccessful run to become America’s first female president in 2016, losing to Trump in an election that shocked many. But, taking the stage once again at the DNC on Monday night, the longtime Democratic politician stressed her belief that Ms Harris would have a better outcome.  “On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th President of the United States.” Ms Clinton - who is reportedly a close adviser of Ms Harris - said her defeat in 2016 inspired millions of women to march, run for office and keep “our eyes on the future of America”. To loud applauses from the crowd, she repeated a line from her 2016 speech almost word for word: “When a barrier falls for one of us, it clears the way for all of us."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylqv3g4rwo,The 'blended' family behind Kamala Harris,"Take a look at the husband, step-children and others supporting Kamala Harris in her White House bid.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has had to quickly re-introduce herself to US voters, who are now having to size her up as a potential commander-in-chief, instead of Joe Biden's deputy. And during the biggest moment of Ms Harris's career so far - the Democratic convention in Chicago - they have gotten to know her family as well. Here are the members of the big and blended family who have helped her get here. Ms Harris met her now-husband, Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff in 2013, while she was serving as California’s attorney general. They were married the following year. Since then Mr Emhoff, 59, has stuck close to his wife’s side as she has risen in the ranks of US politics. In 2020, when Ms Harris made history as the first black and South Asian woman to become vice-president, Mr Emhoff made history too as the first husband of an American president or vice-president, as well as the first Jewish spouse of a vice-president.  He left his law firm that year to focus full-time on his role as ""second gentleman"", a position that has pulled him out of relative obscurity. He is now known as an enthusiastic champion for Democratic party causes and Ms Harris’s most loyal surrogate on the campaign trail. And in a prime-time slot on the second night of the convention, a beaming Mr Emhoff one again was his wife's biggest booster. ""She’s always been there for our children,” Mr Emhoff said. “and I know she’ll always be there for yours too.” The vice-president’s marriage made her a step-mother to Cole and Ella, the two children Mr Emhoff shares with his first wife, Kerstin Emhoff. Ms Harris has said often that of all her many titles, being ""Momala"" - the term coined by Cole and Ella - is the most important. That affection seems to go both ways - Cole and Ella, now 30 and 25, respectively, have been vocal supporters of Ms Harris.  ""The world’s greatest step-mother"", was Ella’s introduction during the 2020 Democratic convention. ""You’re a rock, not just for our dad, but for three generations of our big, blended family."" Cole, who graduated from Colorado College in 2017, has followed his father into the entertainment industry, with jobs at talent agency WME and, later, Brad Pitt’s production company Plan B. Ella, who graduated from Parsons School of Design in New York City, signed with IMG Models in 2021 and walked in shows for high-fashion brands like Balenciaga and Proenza Schouler. She’s also an artist and a prolific knitter, who launched the knitwear brand and club Soft Hands in 2021. Each night of the DNC Cole and Ella have been been staples in the Harris-Walz family box, cheering on their family and proudly donning campaign merchandise.  Cole and Ella’s mom, Kerstin, has - perhaps unexpectedly - gone out of her way to speak warmly and positively of Ms Harris. Recently, Kerstin came to Ms Harris’s defence when JD Vance’s ""childless cat lady"" comments resurfaced. ""For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,"" Kerstin said in a statement to CNN. ""She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it."" Kerstin, the founder and CEO of production company Prettybird, even provided her creative expertise and connections to the 2020 campaign. ""They were like, 'The ex-wife wants to do what?'"" Kerstin said to Marie Claire in 2020. Kamala Harris is known to be very close to her only sibling and younger sister, Maya Harris. After their parents’ divorce, the two girls were primarily raised by their mother, Shyamala Gopalan, in Berkeley, California. Like her older sister, Maya pursued a career in law, graduating from Stanford University law school in 1992. She worked as a litigator and taught law classes before joining the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California, where she became executive director in 2006. Maya, 57, eventually shifted to politics, serving as a senior policy advisor to Hillary Clinton on her 2016 presidential campaign. She then served as campaign chair to her sister’s failed 2020 bid for Democratic nominee, before becoming a surrogate for the Biden-Harris ticket. Maya’s only child, Meena, followed the Harris family tradition by graduating from law school. Meena advised her ""Aunty"" Kamala through the early stages of her political career, as she moved through positions at elite Silicon Valley companies like Uber, Facebook and Slack. Beginning in 2017, the mother of two launched Phenomenal, a media and merchandising company that focuses on projects led by women and other underrepresented groups. But Meena’s career is still linked in some ways to her aunt’s. In June 2020, she published a children’s book about her aunt and mother called ""Kamala and Maya’s Big Idea"". And after Mr Biden selected Ms Harris as his running mate, Phenomenal began selling “Vice President Aunty” sweatshirts. Husband to Maya, step-father to Meena, Tony West is another accomplished member of the Harris clan, and another lawyer.  A graduate of Stanford law (where he met Maya and her then-toddler daughter), Mr West has worked at high levels of the private and public sector. He was associate attorney general under President Barack Obama and worked as general counsel of PepsiCo.  Mr West is now the chief legal officer of Uber, but he's also emerged as a key adviser to his sister-in-law's campaign.  Uber said this month he would take a leave of absence to devote himself to Team Harris.  ""I have always believed family comes first,"" Mr West said in a statement. ""So I’ve decided to dedicate myself full-time to supporting my family and my sister-in-law on the campaign trail.""    Although Dr Shyamala Gopalan died before she could see her daughter run for president, Kamala and Maya Harris say their scientist mother inspired both of their careers. ""My mother was the first person to tell me that my thoughts and experiences mattered,"" Ms Harris wrote on Facebook in 2022. “My mother would often say to me: 'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things. Make sure you are not the last.'"" Ms Gopalan, who died in 2009, moved to the US from India at age 19 to study science, going on to work as a breast cancer researcher. Her activism in the civil rights movement led her to her future husband: economist and Jamaican immigrant Donald Harris. Ms Harris has credited her mother with raising both her and Maya and her current relationship with her father is unclear."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jlpel2818o,"Obamas, dancing delegates and other takeaways from DNC day two",The former president and first lady aim jokes at Donald Trump - and rapper Lil Jon gets delegates on their feet.,21 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris's White House run received a boost from the Obama double-act at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday evening, when attendees also saw party members break into dance and heard speeches from Republican defectors. Rapper Lil Jon added some extra celebrity firepower to the roll call as Democratic delegates went through the formal process of giving Ms Harris their backing. Monday night included an emotional send-off from President Joe Biden, who reflected on the decades he had spent at the top of US politics before he stepped aside for Kamala Harris to take on the Democratic presidential candidacy. But the next evening, the Obamas were eager to imbue the convention with positive messaging about the future - and to land a few gags at Donald Trump's expense. Here is a look back at some of the night's memorable moments. During back-to-back speeches, Barack and Michelle Obama mixed gags with serious exhortations to Democrats to get out and vote in November - pointing out that Ms Harris was in a close race with Donald Trump.  Mr Obama characterised the Republican presidential candidate as being selfish and dangerous, quipping that he was obsessed with crowd sizes. And Mrs Obama mocked Trump for his use of the term ""black jobs"" on the campaign trail. She suggested that Trump might himself be seeking one of those jobs - in a reference to her husband's previous tenure of the White House. By contrast, Ms Harris represented ""hope"", Ms Obama said, echoing her husband's campaign messaging from 2008. One of the night's speakers was none other than Trump's former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who resigned in the wake of the attack on the US Capitol by Trump's supporters on 6 January 2021. Ms Grisham said she would vote for Ms Harris in November, and explained her defection by saying: ""I couldn't be part of the insanity any longer.""  She launched her own broadside at Trump, accusing him of having ""no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth"". Other Republicans who had crossed the political aisle made speeches, too - including Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona. Whether their interventions will sway Republicans is far from certain, given the tight grip that Trump and his wing have on their party.  The ex-president's allies made sure to launch fresh barbs of their own. Trump's presidential running mate JD Vance used a news conference to attack Harris over the ""failures"" of her vice-presidency, focusing on crime and public safety. America's Second Gentleman had his own moment in the spotlight. Ms Harris's husband Doug Emhoff was introduced to the stage by his son Cole, who said their ""blended family"" had adjusted to their high-profile life in Washington. ""It felt like Doug was a bit out of place on Capitol Hill,"" said Cole, the stepson of Ms Harris. ""I thought, 'What is my goofy dad doing here?' But he embraced it."" Mr Emhoff went on to laud his wife as the ""right person"" for him and for the US alike. Meanwhile, a plane carrying Ms Harris herself - who had left a rally in Wisconsin - is reported to have circled for about 10 minutes in the air so that she could finish watch her husband's speech before landing. Adding some extra stardust to the political event were filmmaker Spike Lee and actress Eva Longoria, among other famous faces.  Lil Jon showed up, too, performing a ceremonial duty for his home state during a rap that got Democrats dancing in the stands. When asked which person Georgia was giving its 123 votes, he endorsed Ms Harris and sang bars of his hit Turn Down For What. Convention attendees also saw the moves of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who boogied his way to the stage to giggles in the room.  Bernie Sanders gave his own speech on Tuesday night - but the energy in the arena was minimal. A murmur of people talking could be heard at the same time.  That is in contrast to the hero's welcome that the veteran senator received in 2016, the year he challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Then, his supporters streamed into the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Eight years later, Mr Sanders could still be witnessed railing against oligarchs and corporate interests, but the atmosphere was very different. One explanation was that the building was filled with delegates who originally supported Joe Biden – rather than the Sanders faithful. But it could also signal that the senator has no clear successor to lead the Democratic progressive left."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ey324neeo,Harris speech to provide finale to Democratic convention on day four,The vice-president's' speech will share the story of her upbringing and contrast her vision for America to the one offered by Trump.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democrats will gather in Chicago on Thursday night where Vice-President Kamala Harris will make the biggest speech of her life, as she readies herself for the sprint before November's presidential election. On the final day of the Democratic National Convention, Ms Harris will formally accept her party's nomination - following a ceremonial roll call earlier in the week during which state delegates confirmed their support. Her running mate Tim Walz spoke on Wednesday night, making a personal pitch to middle America by giving a ""pep talk"" in the vein of an American football coach. US political conventions, which happen every four years before a presidential election, date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered to nominate him for a second term. Here’s what to know about the 2024 DNC, which has been attended by thousands of people. The convention has all been building up to Thursday night. When she takes the stage, Vice-President Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination, and give a speech looking ahead to November. It will be the most significant address of her political career. Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden stepped aside and gave her his backing, following weeks of pressure from party members. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who both represent swing states, are also expected to speak on Thursday - as is high-profile Republican Adam Kinzinger. Wednesday night was Mr Walz's first significant opportunity to introduce himself to the nation - and specifically to connect with middle America.  His speech was heavy on his personal story, including the importance of his family, his teaching career and time spent coaching a high-school football team, his stint in Army National Guard, and his service as a congressman and Minnesota governor. Long-time TV host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance, receiving a raucous response and urging Americans to ""choose truth"" in the upcoming vote. Other prominent Democrats who featured on the same night included grandees Bill Clinton, the former president, and Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.  There were also appearances by rising stars such as Josh Shapiro, the governor of the swing state of Pennsylvania. Earlier in the week, the convention heard from President Joe Biden, who stepped aside last month for Ms Harris to contest the presidency. On Monday, he gave an emotional defence of his time in the White House: ""America, I gave my best to you."" The same evening, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, took the stage and voiced her hope that Ms Harris could finally break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US by becoming the first female president.  During back-to-back speeches on Tuesday, Barack and Michelle Obama mixed gags with serious exhortations to Democrats to get out and vote in November. ""Hope is making a comeback,"" said Mrs Obama. This was a contrast with the ""chaos"" of Donald Trump's time in the White House, Mr Obama added. And Trump's former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham gave a speech of her own criticising her ex-boss. America's Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff was introduced to the stage on the same night by his son Cole, who called him a ""goofy dad"".  Mr Emhoff went on to laud his wife, Ms Harris, as the ""right person"" for him and the presidency alike. Because Ms Harris and Mr Walz were already nominated ahead of the event, and the roll call was a formality, this year's convention has been focused on speeches and the adoption of the party’s policy platform. Delegates have been working in the daytimes to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence.  In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it. Members of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there is plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself has been offering live-streams on social media platforms.

About 50,000 people are thought to have travelled to the event in Chicago. They include thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties, as well as party grandees and some members of the Democratic National Committee. As with the equivalent Republican event last month, which featured famous faces as well, the DNC has been a star-studded affair. Winfrey and Lil Jon have been joined by musicians Stevie Wonder, John Legend and Lil Jon, and comedian Mindy Kaling. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will make appearances themselves, but neither has confirmed anything. Demonstrations have been taking place outside the convention centre, focusing on opposition to US support of Israel’s war in Gaza. A further demonstration is planned on Thursday.  On Wednesday, a group of delegates who were denied the chance to speak at the convention began a sit-in outside the arena. The delegates, selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year, have pledged themselves ""uncommitted"" to any presidential candidate as part of an internal protest over Gaza. Earlier in the week, a protest on Tuesday near Chicago's Israeli consulate culminated in scuffles between demonstrators and police and led to several arrests. And thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest on Monday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. Several were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence. In that night's address, Mr Biden acknowledged that the activists ""have a point"", going on to say that ""a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89wygq2k7zo,Kiribati’s pro-China leader faces an election test,The Pacific nation votes amid concerns around the cost of living and stronger ties with China.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The remote Pacific Island nation of Kiribati headed to the polls on Wednesday in a general election that could hold profound implications for the South Pacific region. The archipelago, which has a population of about 116,000, is viewed as strategically valuable to both China and the United States due to its relatively close proximity to Hawaii and its relatively vast claim of oceanic territory, according to experts. In recent years its government has also forged strong relations with Beijing, after current long-time President Taneti Maamau shifted the country’s ties from Taiwan to China in 2019. Now, as President Maamau seeks to extend his near decade in power, outside observers are watching and waiting to see where Kiribati’s geopolitical allegiances will fall. “In the space of five years we've seen a very rapid escalation of China’s political access, economic influence, and increasingly security access into Kiribati and the territory that it controls – a hugely significant change brought on by the incumbent president,” Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, told BBC News. “That's the issue that’s at stake: this rapid escalation in ties between Kiribati and China.” On the ground, Mr Sora said, the I-Kirabiti people will likely have voted based on issues affecting them day-to-day, such as the cost of living, the economy, and the “poor state of government services”. “But internationally, of course, people will be interested in what foreign policy posture would a new government take,” he added.  While US efforts to establish an embassy in Kiribati stall, China’s presence in the country has become increasingly tangible. In February, Reuters reported that Chinese police had begun working alongside local authorities on the ground in Kiribati. Last month, China donated riot control gear to the Kiribati police force, saying it was willing to “elevate China-Kiribati relations to a new level”, according to a post on Kiribati Police Service’s Facebook. From China’s perspective, Kiribati has become increasingly strategically valuable as  geopolitical rivalries in the South Pacific grow, according to Mr Sora.  It is for this same reason that warming ties between the two nations have stoked anxieties in the West. “Ultimately the scenario that the US and allies will be looking to avoid is the establishment of infrastructure that has you seeing Chinese vessels on rotation in Kiribati, for example, or the placement of personnel,” Mr Sora said. “The implication of the incumbent retaining power is that this trajectory continues and China increases and consolidates its strategic access to Kiribati.  ""And that changes regional security dynamics. It adds a security overhead to the Pacific Islands region that we haven't seen for a long time."" Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said from Kiribati’s perspective, China is likely seen as a valuable development partner that can provide support against economic and climatic concerns. “Obviously a lot of these [South Pacific] countries are quite small, they're facing large climate and environmental threats, and so they need access to a range of partners to really keep building on their development. And that includes China,” Mr Johnson told BBC Newsday. As people on the ground in Kiribati cast their votes, he added, they might have been questioning whether their government’s relationship with China is truly improving their quality of life, or negatively impacting it. “Geopolitics always come second to the everyday needs of the people,” Mr Johnson said. Mr Sora added that in many ways global geopolitical concerns have distracted from these more pressing, everyday issues. “You have this competition for access and influence playing out in various ways… but one of the criticisms is that it’s distracted from development partner support to traditional sectors like health and education,” he said. “It’s quite easy to demonstrate how geopolitics has distracted from key development issues.” Voting is not compulsory in Kiribati, and Wednesday's ballot is the first of two rounds in which citizens will select the country’s members of parliament. These will be followed by the vote for president. The country’s last election was in 2020."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce315d6vvn3o,Michelle Obama belittles Trump in starry convention turn,"The Obamas opted to use jokes, not dark and ominous warnings, in their takedown of the Republican candidate, writes North America editor Sarah Smith.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Last month, when Joe Biden’s candidacy was in tatters and speculation was swirling about whether he would stand aside, a poll suggested only one Democrat could beat Donald Trump. That candidate, the Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated, was Michelle Obama. The former first lady consistently polls as the most popular Democrat in America. And despite Mrs Obama repeatedly making clear she has no political ambitions, there have long been reports from within Trumpworld of concern about her fulfilling the fantasies of many Democrats and deciding to run. And after her performance in Chicago last night, it is easy to understand why they may have been worried. Mrs Obama lit up the second night of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday with what some commentators declared the best political speech they had ever heard. Speaking at the same event eight years ago, Mrs Obama famously said “when they go low, we go high”. But last night, she and her husband took a different tack. They painted Trump as a grievance obsessed grumbler whose act had gone stale. There was no mistake who Mrs Obama was referring to when she said that for most  Americans: “If things don’t go our way, we don’t have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead… we don’t get to change the rules so we always win.” Mrs Obama said she knew from experience that Trump is likely to resort to “ugly, misogynistic, racist lies” about Kamala Harris. And she got a huge laugh when, referring to Trump’s comment in June that illegal immigrants are taking “black jobs”, she said: “Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs? Laughing at the former president is a new approach for Democrats, but it may be a very effective one. The change in approach is often credited to Ms Harris’s vice-presidential pick Tim Walz who has repeatedly branded Trump “weird”, a label that other Democrats have used in recent weeks. Joe Biden often issued dark warnings that Trump poses a dangerous threat to democracy. That built up the former president as a sinister but significant figure. Both Michelle and Barack Obama opted for the new approach by using jokes to cut him down. Their jokes were designed to cast Trump as ego-driven and petty.  In their telling, he is not so much an evil menace but a self-obsessed irritation. Like “the neighbour who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day”, as Barack Obama put it. When Mr Obama, during his speech, poked fun at Trump’s comments on crowd sizes, his hand gestures made clear he was also referring to a certain part of the male anatomy – and the crowd roared with laughter. At the same time Ms Harris was holding a campaign rally 80 miles away in Milwaukee. In exactly the same arena in which Trump accepted his party’s presidential nomination last month. And in case anyone wanted to compare crowd sizes, the auditorium was packed out, a fact the Harris campaign pointed out to journalists. Joe Biden declared on Monday night that November’s election was “a battle for the very soul of America”. But the Obamas offered a less ominous - and perhaps less divisive - view. Mr Obama called on Democrats to listen to the concerns of people who do not yet support Ms Harris, and warned against demonising Trump supporters. “If a parent or grandparent occasionally says something that makes us cringe, we don’t automatically assume they’re bad people,” he said. “We recognise the world is moving fast, and that they need time and maybe a little encouragement to catch up.” By criticising Trump but not his supporters, and by poking fun at him rather than provoking fear about him, the Obamas may have hit on a more effective way to campaign against a candidate who, just weeks ago at the Republican convention, appeared almost unassailable."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xy10qn22o,Walz's 2006 campaign made misleading claims on drink-driving arrest,Recent backlash Mr Walz faces stems from how former aides described the incident years after his arrest.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Tim Walz is facing backlash after reports revealed his 2006 congressional campaign made false claims about a drink-driving arrest when he was a high school teacher.  A police officer in 1995 stopped Mr Walz, who was 31 at the time, in Nebraska for going 96mph (154km/h) in a 55mph zone.  He pleaded guilty in March 1996 to a reduced charge of reckless driving. He lost his license for 90 days and was fined $200 (£154), the Associated Press reported.  But in 2006, his campaign manager at the time told media that Mr Walz was not drunk when he was pulled over, falsely suggesting it was a misunderstanding. Mr Walz failed field sobriety and breath tests after the trooper smelled alcohol on his breath, court documents show.  He was then transported to the hospital for a blood test where his blood alcohol level was 0.128% compared to the legal limit of 0.10%, according to court documents.  Mr Walz told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper that he was watching college football with friends before his arrest. He was booked into the Dawes County jail.  Then a high school teacher, he reported the incident to his principal and resigned from his football coaching responsibilities at the school. He offered to quit his teaching job, but the principal talked him into staying, the Star Tribune reported.  He said he quit drinking after the incident and described it as a ""gut-check moment"" in a 2018 interview. The recent backlash Mr Walz faces stems from how his former campaign aides from his 2006 congressional run described the incident to local media.  His campaign manager at the time suggested Mr Walz was not drunk, saying he could not understand the trooper because of hearing loss from his time serving in the National Guard.  The campaign manager also falsely claimed to the Rochester Post Bulletin that the judge who dismissed the case had criticized the arresting officer for not understanding that Walz had hearing loss.  Walz had ear surgery in 2005 to fix his hearing loss, the Associated Press reported. But court records do not mention that Mr Walz struggled to hear the officer at the time of the arrest. His campaign at the time also claimed that Mr Walz was allowed to drive himself to jail on the night of the arrest, which was untrue.  Mr Walz reportedly acknowledged that he was drunk at the time of the arrest.  ""It's just a dangerous situation,"" Mr Walz said in a 1996 court transcript of the hearing. ""Not just to myself, but to the others who aren't even involved with it.""  The BBC has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r412qeydo,Royce White: A candidate's controversial path from NBA to Maga,The former basketball star who has expressed fringe and conspiratorial beliefs won the Republican senate primary in Minnesota.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A Republican senate candidate in Minnesota has taken a meandering path from sport into politics, where he has earned support from the far-right fringes.  Now he faces a difficult battle to enter Congress. Royce White, a former standout basketball player, won the GOP primary on Tuesday, capturing 38.5% of the vote in a crowded eight-candidate field. He was seen as an underdog before he won the endorsement of the state party delegates in May. But his fringe views and tough competition in the form of incumbent Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar mean that he is a longshot to win the general election.  Mr White, a Minnesota native, was a star high school player on two state championship teams before taking the court at Iowa State University. He was drafted by the Houston Rockets in 2012 even though his severe fear of flying hampered his ability to travel. Ultimately he saw little action in the league, playing in just three games, and later tried his hand at mixed martial arts and Big3, the 3-on-3 basketball league co-founded by rapper Ice Cube. Meanwhile, his openness about his struggles with mental health issues, including anxiety, gave him a wide public platform.  After the murder of George Floyd in his home state in 2020, Mr White, who is black, organised and led protests, although he says on his web site these were separate from the larger Black Lives Matter demonstrations that swept through the country. Since then, Mr White’s politics have taken an increasingly rightward and conspiratorial turn.  A frequent guest on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast, he has occasionally slid into the hosting chair while Bannon – former chief strategist to Donald Trump – serves time in prison for contempt of Congress. In 2022, Mr White tried to challenge progressive Democrat Ilhan Omar for her US House seat in Minneapolis, but he failed to make the first step, losing the Republican primary. Along the way Mr White has racked up a list of controversies.  While playing in Big3 games, he’s written political slogans on his bald scalp including “United States of the Federal Reserve”, “Deep state” and “Alex Jones was right” – his campaign website currently includes an endorsement from the conspiracy theorist. A watchdog group has alleged in a complaint to the Federal Elections Commission that his House campaign spent more than $150,000 (£117,000) on White’s personal expenses including gym fees, clothing and bills at a strip club. He has repeated conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic and about “Jewish elites"", and also made public statements that have raised the ire of people in his party and out, such as saying that “women have become too mouthy”. The Republican Jewish Coalition labelled him anti-Semitic and opposed him in the primary election after he made comments about Jewish people and supporting Kanye West. Mr White has accused his critics of being in a “white liberal ivory tower” and argued that he is being attacked for holding conservative values. His campaign – which the BBC reached out to for comment – has posted a long rebuttal of criticisms against him. Among them, Mr White says that he has accounted for most of his campaign funds and rejects charges of anti-Semitism.  Earlier this year, Mr White was seen as highly unlikely to capture the Republican Senate nomination against his main opponent, Joe Fraser, a military veteran and businessman. However, his association with Bannon and his controversial statements “created an explosion of enthusiasm and support for him at the Republican convention among the anti-establishment far-right,"" said Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota. Mr White won the endorsement of the state party at that meeting in May.  Mr Fraser briefly considered dropping out of the race but continued on to Tuesday’s primary with the endorsements of a number of prominent Minnesota Republicans. The establishment support wasn’t enough, and he garnered a little less than 30% of the vote. Celebrating his underdog victory, Mr White posted on X: “I am committed to growing the base, bringing disenfranchised Democrats into the tent, and unifying all conservatives in Minnesota.” But now he faces a major challenge in trying to unseat Ms Klobuchar, a popular Democrat  who won her last re-election  with more than 60% of the vote. The state Democratic Party called him ""a far-right extremist.  And Mr Jacobs, the politics professor, gives Mr White “no chance” of winning in November. “Amy Klobuchar is popular even among Republicans, she has $6m in the bank, and I doubt that Royce White is going to raise very much money at all,” he says. “There’s not one aspect of this race that favours Royce White.” The race, he says, is yet another indication of how the Republican Party is now dominated by Donald Trump and the Maga movement. “Sometimes Trump has been able to get behind candidates who prevail,” Mr Jacobs said, citing JD Vance's victory in the Ohio senate race in 2022. “But you also get a lot of candidates who are very weak, and taking advantage of this moment of right-wing chaos.” "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nv5384rmo,Trump made $300k from selling bibles - but owes $100m,"The Republican lists over 150 pages of assets, but he also owes more than $100m (£91m) from lawsuits.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former US President Donald Trump is making money from branded bibles and cryptocurrency holdings.  But he also owes more than $100m (£91m) in liabilities from three lawsuits he has lost, according to new financial disclosure forms released on Thursday.  Federal candidates are required to file disclosures each year detailing their income, investments, assets and liabilities.   While the former president lists over 150 pages of assets, his liabilities add up to tens of millions owed for the legal troubles he's faced this year.  Trump has made $300,000 (£273,000) from branded bibles, listed on the financial disclosure form as ""The Greenwood Bible"".  The former president started selling the books earlier this year after partnering with country music singer Lee Greenwood.  Mr Greenwood is known for his song God Bless the USA, which inspired the name of the bible: God Bless the USA Bible.  They are for sale on Mr Greenwood's website for $59.99. Trump also earned income from sales of several of his own books. He earned $4.5m in royalties from Letters to Trump - which features letters between Trump and celebrities - and $500,000 from A MAGA Journey.  The form also lists Trump holding between $1m and $5m in cryptocurrency, which the former president once called ""a scam"".  He has since reversed his stance and recently embraced the digital currency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.  ""Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar,"" he said. ""The behaviour of the current US government is really threatening the dollar.""  Though his list of assets is longer, Trump's list of liabilities is costly. He lists three new ones on his financial disclosure form, all related to his court cases.  The liabilities are listed as ""litigation; stayed pending appeal; bonded"".  The first liability amounts to between $1m and $5m owed to writer and columnist E. Jean Carroll. The second, also listed as funds owed to Ms Carroll, is a much larger amount totaling more than $50m.  Ms Carroll filed a pair of defamation suits against the former president, alleging he sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a department store.  A judge ruled Trump had defamed Ms Carroll by calling her sexual assault accusation a lie.  A New York jury later found the former president liable of defaming Ms Carroll while he was president.  Trump vowed to appeal the ruling.  The third liability of over $50m covers a bond in a civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who alleged Trump fraudulently inflated property values.  A judge ruled Trump must pay more than $350m in damages in the civil fraud case.  Trump denied the allegations and has appealed the judge's ruling.  "

Sosan and her husband came to London in 2023 and have been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK through the government's resettlement scheme, along with thousands of other Afghan nationals now living in the capital. ""I was in Afghanistan and I saw the Taliban shoot women and girls, just because they didn’t wear the hijab,"" she says. ""Women are all in danger I think in Afghanistan, doesn’t matter who she is,"" she adds.  Sosan says many of her family and friends were unable to escape when the Taliban took control, and have been unable to work or access education in the country ever since.  She says reports of her closest friend being punished by the Taliban for leaving the house without a hijab have haunted her. ""It was so hard for me to hear about her. The Taliban tortured her, and maybe they want to kill her,"" she tells the BBC.  Rafiq has been living and working in the capital for the past 13 years, but grew up in Afghanistan. ""We say every day they kill our young people in Afghanistan,"" he says. Showing a video he has been sent over WhatsApp only yesterday, Rafiq says it shows one of many civilian murders carried out by the Taliban. He also says that news from the region is often censored, to prevent the world outside from witnessing the scale and extent of Taliban brutality. Visibly upset and with tears in his eyes, Sosan translates for him: ""When he sees this kind of video he wants to cry, and when he sees the videos he shakes."" The Afghanistan and Central Asian Association centre (ACAA) in Feltham has supported people arriving in London ever since the evacuation began. ""Here in Feltham we’re surrounded by lots of bridging hotels around Heathrow Airport and people have been separated for three years,"" says the ACAA's Darius Nasimi, the first British-Afghan Conservative candidate in the 2022 local elections. ""There are lots of people who have arrived recently because of family reunification and there’s always an ever increasing need to support them because there’s lots of pressure on the local authorities,"" he says. Mr Nasimi adds: ""During the recent riots that were happening across the UK, there was a hotel that came under attack and the asylum seekers living inside, some of them were from Afghanistan, so they felt quite unsafe."" Dr Nooralhaq Nasimi, founder and director of the ACAA, says: ""The anxiety of the people gets worse day by day.  ""You see millions of people going to the streets in London to support the people of Palestine, but millions of people in the UK don’t know what’s going on in Afghanistan."" The government says 17,039 people have arrived in the UK from Afghanistan via the Afghan Resettlement Programme as of the end of March 2024, with 2,562 in London. Most came as part of Operation Pitting, the British military operation to evacuate British nationals and Afghans from Kabul, which began in August 2021, with some close family members being brought over afterwards.  The government told the BBC that long-term immigration had been granted to those who were identified for evacuation from Afghanistan.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqr48zld2o,"Long-doubted by Democrats, Kamala Harris faces her biggest political moment",She has generated huge voter enthusiasm since becoming the party’s presidential candidate - and it reflects years of deliberate preparation for a role many thought she wasn’t cut out for.,18 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"When Kamala Harris steps onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week as the party’s presidential nominee, she’ll do so knowing that many in the audience cheering her on once counted her out. Ms Harris, 59, has faced years of doubt from some within her party about her ability to run for America’s highest political office - including from President Joe Biden, the man whom she continues to serve as vice-president. Since replacing Mr Biden as Democratic nominee in mid-July, Ms Harris has seen a tidal wave of enthusiasm for her candidacy - reflected in polling, fundraising and the enormous crowds that have come out to see her at rallies across the country. But the political momentum and energy she has generated in recent weeks among Democrats was never a given. After failing in a short-lived presidential bid in 2019, she began her vice-presidency on a shaky footing, beset by stumbles in high-profile interviews, staff turnover and low approval ratings. And for the last three-and-a-half years in the White House she has struggled to break through to American voters. Advisers and allies say that in the years since those early struggles she has sharpened her political skills, created loyal coalitions within her party and built credibility on issues like abortion rights that energise the Democratic base. She has, in other words, been preparing for a moment exactly like this one. On Thursday, as she formally accepts the Democratic nomination, Ms Harris has an opportunity to reintroduce herself on the national stage with fewer than 80 days until an election that could see her become the nation’s first female president. At the same time, she’ll have to prove that she is capable of leading a party that never saw her as its natural leader and remains divided over the war in Israel and Gaza. But above all, she’ll need put to rest any lingering doubt among the Democratic faithful that she can meet the challenge of defeating former president Donald Trump in what remains a tight and unpredictable contest. Before Kamala Harris became a national figure, the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general had forged a reputation as a rising star in the party, landing the endorsement of President Barack Obama in her 2010 race to become the state’s top lawyer. But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state’s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. “Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden’s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling. She attacked Mr Biden for an earlier campaign moment in which he fondly recalled working with two segregationist senators, before accusing him of opposing the bussing of students between schools to help integrate them. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Ms Harris said. “And that little girl was me.” But campaign infighting and indecision on which issues to emphasise ultimately sank her presidential bid. The campaign was marked by “a lot of rookie mistakes”, said Kevin Madden, an adviser on Republican Mitt Romney’s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. “The substance that needed to be there to pass the commander-in-chief test and to really fill in some of the blanks for voters, it just wasn’t there and as a result her opponents filled it in for her.” Eight months later, Mr Biden put aside their primary rivalry and announced Ms Harris as his running mate. She became the first woman of colour to ever be nominated in that position - and in January 2021, the first female vice-president in US history. It was five months into her job as Mr Biden’s vice-president that Ms Harris endured her first public stumble during a foreign trip to Guatemala and Mexico. The trip was meant to showcase her role in pursuing economic initiatives to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the US southern border, a foreign policy assignment given to her by Mr Biden. But it was quickly overshadowed by an awkward exchange in an interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, in which she dismissed repeated questions about why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border. Later that day, during a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Ms Harris tried to recapture the narrative, delivering a stark message to migrants thinking of making their way to the US. “Do not come,” she told them. “Do not come.” While the NBC News interview fuelled Republican attacks that continue to this day, the latter comments drew the ire of progressives and were quickly panned on social media, even though other administration officials had echoed the same rhetoric. The vice-president’s allies blamed the White House for failing to adequately prepare her and assigning an unwinnable issue. They complained that as the first woman, African-American and Asian-American to serve as vice-president, outsized expectations had been imposed on her from the very start of her term, giving her little time to settle. “There was immense pressure in the beginning to own things,” said one former aide who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their time in the White House. In the months that followed, Ms Harris endured more scrutiny as she faced high staff turnover, a slew of negative headlines about her performance and underwhelming media appearances. Hemmed in by Covid restrictions, she was limited in her public engagements, fuelling the perception that she was invisible. When critics labelled her a prop for standing behind Mr Biden at bill-signing ceremonies – as her white male predecessors in the role regularly did – a decision was made to remove her from those events altogether, according to aides, triggering more criticism that she was absent. “People had an expectation to experience her as vice-president as if she was Michelle Obama, but she was in a job… built for Al Gore or Mike Pence,” said Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist who was brought in as her communications director during the second year. As her team sought to improve her poor public image, Ms Harris stepped into a bigger foreign policy role. She travelled to Poland in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, held bilateral meetings in Asia amid heightened tensions with China and stood in for Mr Biden at the Munich Security Conference that same year. But in May 2022, a political earthquake would reshape the trajectory of her vice-presidency. In a rare breach of the Supreme Court, a leaked draft opinion revealed plans to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade abortion ruling - which had protected American women’s federal right to abortion for nearly half a century. She seized on the opportunity to be the lead messenger on an issue that Mr Biden – a devout Irish Catholic who avoided even saying the term “abortion” – was reluctant to own. “How dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body?” she told the crowd at an event for a pro-choice group on the same day the bombshell leak was published, deciding to attack the nation’s top judges before their decision was officially released. The issue proved to be a driving force for voters in the midterm elections a few months later, helping Democrats to perform better than expected in congressional races and to hold the Senate. In seeking to become the administration’s leading voice on abortion, Ms Harris tackled the issue with “clarity of purpose”, said former longtime adviser Rachel Palermo. She convened state legislators, faith leaders, constitutional law experts, healthcare providers and advocates for roundtable discussions. It was a move panned by some activists as not meeting the seriousness of the moment but it was part of a strategy of coalition-building across local and state politics that also helped lay the groundwork for any future presidential run. Ms Harris, who spent most of her career navigating California’s tricky mix of liberal and traditional Democratic politics, knew every event mattered. Every meeting, photo opportunity or dinner - whether it was with black business leaders or Hispanic female CEOs – was tracked by her team in detailed spreadsheets that she could utilise when the time came to call on a deep political network for support. “She forced the operation to mobilise around how she views politics, which is coalitions,” a senior official said. Ms Harris always had her eye on a 2028 bid for the White House, as Joe Biden’s natural successor, assuming he won a second term in the 2024 contest. Yet as rumblings mounted about replacing Mr Biden on the ticket after his stumbling debate performance in late June against Donald Trump, some Democrats openly overlooked her. They, and many pundits, suggested popular governors like California’s Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro or Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer as better replacements who could motivate voters and take the fight to Trump. On 21 July, Mr Biden phoned Ms Harris to tell her of his plans to drop out of the race and endorse her as his successor. It was a decision that took many of his closest allies by surprise, but she sprang into action. Over the course of 10 hours that Sunday, she called more than 100 party officials, members of Congress, labour leaders and activists. Within days, any potential rivals, including the powerful governors, had fallen into line and it was clear that she would take the Democratic mantle with no serious challenge. As a candidate, the vice-president has yet to lay out a detailed policy agenda or sit down for a tough media interview. She released an economic blueprint on Friday, calling for tax cuts for families and a wider push on capping drug pricing, her most detailed vision for the country so far. Even as Republicans  accuse her of avoiding scrutiny, the team around her see no rush in cutting off the momentum she’s built over the last month. Political strategists say the campaign is right to capitalise on the “sugar high”. “What Kamala Harris is experiencing is a massive, pent-up demand for people to vote for anybody not named Biden or Trump,” said Mr Madden, the former Romney aide and Republican communications strategist. “But the test always comes with being exposed to interviews, the press, debates and the harsh glare of a campaign.” Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who helped organise a meeting of historians at Ms Harris’s official residence last year, said the fact that she has been a blank slate for voters is more of a benefit than a burden. “She may not have been able to be in full bloom under Biden but she never crossed wires with him,” he said. “So she was able to be positioned for this moment and she can take what’s good about the Biden years and shed the baggage of what she wants to, or slightly disagrees with.” Though her entrance has jolted an outpouring of support among Democrats, it’s unclear whether she can translate that into broad appeal. While Ms Harris has made some inroads with key demographic groups that had drifted from Mr Biden – black, Latino and young voters in particular – she lags in other constituencies that made up his winning 2020 coalition. Recent polling puts her ahead or tied with Trump in six of the seven battleground states, according to a Cook Political Report survey released on Wednesday. In May, when Mr Biden was still the Democratic candidate, Trump was ahead or tied in all seven states. Thursday night’s speech at the Democratic convention is the most consequential moment in Kamala Harris’s political career. While the Republican convention served as a coronation for Trump, who was nominated as his party’s candidate for the third consecutive time, Ms Harris’s sudden rise means her speech will be seen as a pivotal moment to define who she really is. While she’s stood on the stage before, a senior aide said the speech will have a heavier focus on her personal story than previous nominees. “This is the why part of the conversation. Why is she running for president? What is her vision for the country?” said Mr Simmons, her former communications director. “That will help tie together all of the strands of her policy and political life that will make sense for people.” But over the course of four days, Ms Harris will need to sharpen her messaging around crime, inflation, the economy and immigration – issues the Trump campaign will relentlessly target between now and election day. Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican strategist, said Ms Harris will also at some point have to clarify the left-leaning positions she took in 2019 during her failed presidential bid. ""Her greatest vulnerability is that there is plenty of evidence that she's a San Francisco liberal with a whole set of far left wing policy positions that are outside the mainstream of American thinking, and she hasn't had to answer for those yet,"" he said.  She will also be confronted with protests over Israel’s actions in Gaza, a polarising issue that has politically cleaved the party. Ms Harris has been more forceful in her calls for a ceasefire and condemnation of civilian deaths than President Biden, but she has not wavered from the administration’s steadfast support for Israel - a stance that risks alienating the party’s progressive wing. “How she positions [herself on Gaza] is going to be her hardest trick,” said Mr Brinkley, the presidential historian. Still, allies and advisers who have been preparing her over the last week contend she’s built the foundations for a presidential run over the last four – sometimes bumpy – years, even if few expected she would actually find herself in this position at this moment. “Opportunity is preparation meeting a little bit of luck and I wouldn’t characterise this as luck, because nobody wanted it to be this way, but certainly she was prepared to meet the moment of opportunity,” a senior political adviser said. Susie Tompkins Buell, a Democratic donor and co-founder of Esprit and The North Face who has known Ms Harris since the 1990s, said she wasn’t surprised by how Ms Harris had performed in the last few weeks. In the days after Mr Biden’s halting debate performance, she attended an event with the vice-president and said she could tell change was afoot. After telling Ms Harris to fasten her seatbelt, Ms Buell said the soon-to-be Democratic nominee quipped, “I was born with a seatbelt.” “I liked her response,” said Ms Tompkins Buell, who helped Ms Harris raise $12m at a San Francisco fundraiser earlier this month. “It was sudden and it was right on. She’s ready.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9lvr3yq3go,Foetuses can be called 'unborn humans' for Arizona abortion vote,"Pro-choice activists criticised the ruling, but the state's top court said the wording did not break impartiality rules.",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Judges in Arizona have allowed officials to call a foetus an ""unborn human being"" in public information leaflets ahead of a statewide vote on abortion in November. Pro-choice activists criticised the ruling, saying the phrase is ""biased"", but the state's top court said the wording did not break impartiality rules. America has been locked in a bitter debate over reproductive freedoms after the US Supreme Court rescinded the nationwide right to abortion two years ago. On 5 November, the issue will again be in the spotlight, when Arizona and other states vote on whether to add a woman's right to an abortion to their own constitutions. The group Arizona for Abortion Access said voters would be ""subjected to biased, politically-charged words developed not by experts but by anti-abortion special interests"". It added it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision of the state supreme court, which sided with state Republican lawmakers. One of those Republicans, House Speaker Ben Toma, hailed the ruling as ""correct"", the Associated Press reported, and said the move was designed to aid voters' understanding. The court - whose judges were appointed by Republicans - has promised to release a full opinion later, AP added. Women in Arizona are currently prevented from terminating a pregnancy after 15 weeks, with some exceptions, as a result of legislation brought by the Republicans in 2022. That law was passed after the US Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v Wade: a landmark ruling which rescinded the nationwide right to abortion and set in train a nationwide debate over reproductive rights.  In Arizona specifically, this reached a head earlier this year when state lawmakers battled over a 160-year law that would have almost totally banned abortions, without exceptions in instances of rape and incest.  The state supreme court ruled in April the legislation dating from 1864 could be enforced. The move was briefly hailed as an ""enormous victory"" by one anti-abortion group, before state Democrats forced through a repeal bill with the help of two Republicans in the senate.   At both state and national levels, Democrats have made the abortion issue key to their campaign ahead of 5 November. That is the date of the presidential election as well as the Democratic-supported abortion initiative of the kind seen in Arizona, which was confirmed to be going ahead earlier this week. Many of the states in which these ballots are taking place are key battlegrounds that could have a bearing on the presidential result. Many Republican politicians, meanwhile, have sided with religious conservatives who want abortion banned or limited in the US. In Arizona, the abortion ballot will determine whether or not to amend the state constitution to allow a woman to end a pregnancy up to the time at which a foetus could survive outside the womb. That tends to be about 23 or 24 weeks. The move would prevent future laws being introduced to restrict abortion access - something that opponents say would go too far. The decision of Arizona's top court to allow a foetus to be described an ""unborn human being"" is reminiscent of a decision by Alabama's own supreme court earlier this year. This ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children. Most Americans believe abortion should be legal in at least some situations, recent polling presented by the firm Gallup has indicated. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9854qgpp8zo,"Harris will be 'one hell of a president', says Biden","Joe Biden offered a glowing endorsement of Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump spoke in New Jersey.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden have appeared at an event together for the first time since the president ended his run for a second term and Ms Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee.  The event, held just outside Washington DC, came as Donald Trump spoke at a news conference in New Jersey - his second campaign event in the past two days. The Democratic event on Thursday celebrated the Biden administration's newly announced deal to cut the cost of 10 common prescription drugs for millions of Americans. It also offered a glimpse of the pair's dynamic, weeks into a realignment of the party ticket.  The White House said some 2,300 people attended Thursday's rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland - a Democratic stronghold. “I have an incredible partner in the progress we made,"" the president said. ""She going to make one hell of a president."" But more than the policy announcement, Mr Biden boosted his vice-president. He brought the crowd to their feet multiple times.  The warm feelings were mutual. ""There's a lot of love in this room for our president,"" Ms Harris said. ""Few leaders in our nation have done more, on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable healthcare, than Joe Biden.""  Thousands stood in line in the summer heat for the chance to see Mr Biden and Ms Harris speak. Social media video showed hundreds still in line as the venue reached capacity.  It's the latest in a series of events Ms Harris has hosted that have drawn large crowds of supporters, marking a noticeable shift in energy in the presidential race.  Ms Harris, however, has largely avoided media questions and has yet to sit down for an interview since becoming her party's candidate. Her supporters' enthusiasm is showing up in polling data, too. A recent survey from the Cook Political Report suggests Ms Harris is erasing former President Donald Trump's polling leads in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Vivian Strong waited three hours to get into Thursday's event. She hoped to be part of a historic moment, she told the BBC. ""I feel a sense of urgency to actually ensure she gets elected,"" she said. ""I would hate to have another administration of the other guy.""  Before the president and vice-president took the stage, some supporters led the crowd in chants from Howard University - the historically black university Ms Harris attended in Washington DC.  Many supporters of the vice-president donned pink and green, the colours of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority (AKA) to which Ms Harris belonged.  Linda Jones, a Howard alumna and a member of AKA, said their shared identity excites her. But she was also eager to see Mr Biden speak.  ""I'm happy for President Biden to get something accomplished that he's worked so hard for,"" Ms Jones told the BBC, referring to the prescription drug deal.  ""He's such a good man and I felt very bad he was leaving with a cloud, so now I feel [this policy] is one more boost for him.""  Meanwhile, Trump, who spoke from his golf resort in Bedminster, lashed out as Ms Harris over the course of his press conference - his second in as many weeks.  He argued that he was ""entitled to personal attacks"" against Ms Harris, and hit on his main campaign themes, attacking her record on inflation, crime and immigration. Trump, flanked by common grocery store items with signs showing cost increases in recent years for each, asked: ""How can a family afford that?"" Inflation in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, marking relief for consumers. Inflation has been a top financial concern for many Americans.  “You don’t have to imagine what a Kamala Harris presidency would be like, because you are living through that nightmare right now,” Trump said. ""I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence,"" he said, adding: ""People say, 'Oh be nice'. But they're not nice to me. They want to put me in prison."" Earlier on Thursday, US media reported that the Secret Service would begin using bulletproof glass to protect Trump whenever he is speaking on stage at outdoor campaign events. The measure it typically done for sitting presidents, but an exception is being made in the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump last month in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service declined to comment on the reports."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge4q4j98po,Senegal newspapers go dark amid press freedom warnings,Most national newspapers refuse to publish on Tuesday following tensions with the government.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Senegalese commuters hoping to browse the news on their way to work were left disappointed on Tuesday - most national newspapers refused to publish in protest against what they see as shrinking media freedom under the new government. The media is experiencing ""one of the darkest days of its history,"" the local Council of Press Distributors and Publishers (CDEPS) said. It accuses the government - led by former opposition politicians - of freezing the bank accounts  of media companies and seizing their equipment over alleged non-payment of taxes. Officials justify the crackdown by saying they were trying to end practices that lead to financial embezzlement and mismanagement in the media industry. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye came to power in March after defeating the ruling coalition's candidate in elections. His rise to power came after the opposition led huge protests to demand elections that then-President Macky Sall postponed in what his critics saw as a ploy to cling to power. As part of Tuesday's media blackout, newspapers were displayed on newsstands with no content inside. The editions solely consisted a black cover reading ""journée sans presse"" ( French for ""day without press"") and an image of three raised fists gripping a pencil. Not all papers participated in the protest - private outlet Wal Fadjri called the blackout an “ugly scar on the cheek of our beautiful democracy”.  While agreeing that the press was experiencing a ""crisis"", Wal Fadjri said a blackout should be the last resort as it would deprive readers of their right to information. Radio stations largely rejected the boycott, but two popular private stations opted to play music instead of airing the news.  Private television channels like TFM (owned by Grammy award-winning singer Youssou N’Dour), ITV, and 7 TV broadcast news while demonstrating their support for the protest by featuring its slogan and image. Concerns that the Mr Faye's government would try to restrict the media emerged a few months ago.  Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko was criticised by media professionals in June for warning that the government would no longer tolerate ""falsehood"" by journalists who he said were enjoying ""too much impunity"". Mr Sonko used to be the public face of the opposition, and was barred from running for the presidency. He then backed Mr Faye.  Both of them had been imprisoned under the former government, and pledged to tackle corruption and strengthen democracy in Senegal. From 2021 to 2024, Senegal slipped from 49th to 94th place on media watchdog Reporters Without Borders' world press freedom index. The rights group recently urged Senegal's new president to take action to promote press freedom after years of ""arrests and attacks on journalists, media closures and arbitrary Internet shutdowns"" under Mr Sall.

A jury found former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a Republican, guilty on seven out of 10 counts in the election interference case.  Peters has become well known among election deniers who falsely believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump.  Peters pleaded not guilty to all counts in 2022.  The case represents the first time a local election official has been prosecuted over a suspected security breach during the 2020 election.  ""Tina Peters willfully compromised her own election equipment trying to prove Trump's Big Lie,"" Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement. ""Today's verdict sends a clear message: we will not tolerate any effort to threaten the security of our gold standard elections,"" she added.  The jury deliberated for over four hours on Monday before returning the verdict. Four of the seven charges Peters was found guilty on are felonies.  The former county clerk was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state. Prosecutors say Peters engaged in ""a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people,"" according to the indictment.  Prosecutors said Peters helped breach the county's election computer systems and allowed an unauthorized individual to access voting equipment and election records. The person posted secure election equipment images online.  Peters became ""fixated"" on voting problems after the 2020 presidential election that some falsely believe was rigged against Trump, prosecutors said.  Investigators also issued a search warrant for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a proponant of election fraud claims, in connection to Peters' case, BBC's American partner CBS News reported.  Peters is set to be sentenced on 3 October. Her attorney could not be reached for comment. "

The Boeing 737 had departed from an airport in Milwaukee, where the Ohio senator was attending a campaign event with police officers, and had to turn back for repairs shortly after take-off. After being fixed, the plane continued on to Cincinnati, where Mr Vance lives. Last week, former President Donald Trump was forced to divert course and make an emergency landing as he flew to a rally in Montana. Mr Vance was travelling with his wife Usha, his dog Atlas, his campaign staff, and reporters when the emergency was declared on Friday afternoon. A spokeswoman for Mr Vance, Taylor VanKirk, issued a statement, saying: ""The pilot advised there was a malfunction with the door seal.""  ""After declaring an emergency, Trump Force Two returned to Milwaukee. As soon as the issue was resolved, the plane returned to its originally planned flight path back to Cincinnati.” According to the New York Times, the pilot made an announcement about four minutes into the flight asking passengers to fasten their seatbelts.  ""Secret Service agents aboard the plane reacted with confusion and laughter, and it was not immediately clear to some passengers that there was an emergency until after the plane had landed,"" the paper reported. The pilot reportedly came back over the intercom after landing to apologise for the “elevated heart rates”. Earlier this month, planes belonging to both Mr Vance and Vice-President Kamala Harris happened to coincidently be parked near each other in Wisconsin. Having a ""bit of fun"", Mr Vance strolled over to the aircraft used by each US vice-president and told reporters: ""I just wanted to check out my future plane."" In May, Trump's plane clipped a parked private corporate jet as it taxied on a Florida tarmac.  No injuries were reported and it was unclear whether Trump was on board the aircraft.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl2jqem0eo,Sniper shot Trump gunman's weapon and delayed him - report,"A police sniper potentially saved lives by shooting the rifle of the would-be assassin, a congressional report says.",18 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"A police sniper potentially saved lives by shooting the rifle of Donald Trump's would-be assassin and knocking him down, an investigation says. According to a report by Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins, the sniper's bullet damaged Thomas Matthew Crooks's gun and disrupted his aim after he took his first shots in Butler, Pennsylvania. Moments later, a Secret Service sniper killed him. The report comes as the Secret Service temporarily reassigns some bodyguards from President Joe Biden to Trump, according to US media.  Trump will also be given bulletproof glass protection to allow him to resume outdoor rallies. The former president did not have the protection during his 13 July rally in Butler when a bullet nearly hit him squarely in the head. Mr Higgins' report said a Butler SWAT operator was the first to fire at Trump's assassin - from 100 yards away.  The congressman said the sniper ""ran towards the threat, running to a clear shot position directly into the line of fire"". Then, in a single shot, he fired at the gunman and hit part of his rifle, the report said.  This knocked the gunman off his position temporarily, but, ""after just a few seconds"", he ""popped back up"" before he was fatally shot by a Secret Service sharpshooter.  Crooks killed one crowd member and critically injured two others in the attack.  Security levels around the former president have increased since then.  New records obtained by ABC News detail internal discussions by local authorities about security planned the day of the assassination attempt, with the Butler County sheriff noting the ""circus"" and large crowds the rally would bring. The records also include text messages showing frustration by local authorities after the shooting.  Local authorities discussed the Secret Service requesting a sniper and overwatch support, along with counterassault teams and a quick reaction force.  In an email obtained by ABC News to Butler County's district attorney, Sgt. Edward Lenz of the Adams Township Police Department details that they planned to provide two snipers, a quick reaction force and two mobile counterassault teams.  The counterassault teams ""would respond to and address an attack directed at the presidential candidate inside of the venue, whether it be a coordinated attack with multiple assailants, or a single attacker"", he wrote.  He said the quick reaction force would respond to any ""high-risk incidents occurring outside of the venue"".  The records came after the transfer of Secret Service agents amid threats against Trump, 78. The move was made possible due to the reduced travel schedule of Mr Biden after he dropped out of the election race, according to a report in The New York Times. The reassigned officers were responsible for either travelling with Mr Biden, or going in advance of him to set up security measures at an event, a source told the newspaper. Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, resigned on 23 July following a hearing at the US House of Representatives about the assassination attempt. Politicians on the House Oversight Committee criticised the lack of information in her answers to their questions regarding security planning and how officers responded to reports of the gunman’s suspicious behaviour prior to the shooting. Gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot and killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper team after he fired eight bullets in Mr Trump’s direction from a rooftop just outside the rally's security perimeter. The FBI is currently investigating the protection failure and political leaders in the US Congress have also started inquiries.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp79wjxo,A different kind of Trump goes on display,"While still saying he is ""entitled to personal attacks"", Donald Trump seeks to shift his campaign focus to policy.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The pork sausage was a sign that this was going to be different. Or at least, that it was meant to be. Like a grocery store employee in front of a concession stand, Donald Trump stood framed by the everyday items of an American shopping basket. Breakfast oats. Bread. Butter. The sausage. In a 45-minute-long pre-prepared speech at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey, his remarks appeared designed to signal a shift away from the usual personal attacks on his opponent. Reading off a piece of paper - itself something of departure from his normally freewheeling style - this was instead an attempt to focus on policy and, somewhat like the ground coffee beans that remained in shot throughout,  in granular detail too. The former president listed a barrage of what he said were price increases under the current administration. Flour up 38%, he said. Eggs, 46%. Sure, he questioned whether Kamala Harris loves her country, impugned her intelligence and accused her of being a ""communist"" multiple times. But, compared to what has come before, this was far less heavy on the insults and it will have been music to the ears of at least some senior Republican figures. The concerns in Republican circles about Trump's struggle to adjust to the challenge presented by Ms Harris have been mounting ever since she took over as the presumptive Democrat nominee. “The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see,” Kellyanne Conway, once his campaign manager and close advisor, recently told Fox News. “It’s fewer insults, more insights.” Others too have cringed as Trump has attacked Ms Harris over her racial identity or made bizarre claims that she was engaged in deep-fake fraud over the size of the crowds at her rallies. “So stupid,” Megyn Kelly, the conservative commentator and former Fox News host, said in response to the latter tactic on her radio show. “Just focus on the damn border!” That’s a piece of advice, it has to be said, he doesn’t have too much trouble following. Although his remarks began with a promise to focus on some “big facts and very substantial truths”, as so often they more than strained the definition of both. He claimed, once again, that some countries are emptying out their prisons and “insane asylums” to flood the US with illegal migrants, despite there being no data on the prison history of migrants crossing the border or their mental health status. And he repeated – without any evidence and contrary to government data - that 100% of new jobs have gone to migrants, while regurgitating false claims about having won the 2020 election. But for those Republicans who wanted to see a new approach to counter troubling polling data, meticulous accuracy was likely not high on their list of demands from their candidate. Even that headline list of increasing grocery costs – what Trump called “Kamala’s price hikes” – appeared to raise a number of questions. The Reuters news agency, for example, pointed out that bread and coffee prices have actually fallen over the last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Consumer Price Index. But that’s not really the point. Factual or not, this was Trump connecting to voters on the issues that matter, and many do still feel the effects of the high levels of inflation under President Biden. And with Harris yet to sit down for a formal media interview, he worked hard to land some blows against her on her record, in particular remarks she made in 2020 during widespread protests over police reform where she appeared sympathetic to calls to reduce spending on the police. He also claimed – with some merit – that she’d stolen his pledge to end tax on tips in the US service industry, complaining that it “would’ve been nice” if she’d seen fit to give him credit. The big question, of course, is whether Trump himself can stay on message and stick to these kinds of talking points. In large parts of the press conference he was very much his usual self, giving long-winded diatribes about the mechanics of electric trucks, a “drill baby drill” promise to increase oil extraction, and at one point declaring that “I’m a big fan of electricity.” But something was missing, somewhat akin to a man from the meat marketing board being forced to give a lecture about the health benefits of carrots. You couldn’t help feeling that none of this sat very naturally for a politician whose whole political strategy has so often been fuelled by invective. Opening the floor to questions from reporters he was asked whether he was indeed stepping back from the vitriolic character assassinations of his opponents. “They’re not nice to me,” he said. “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24p94pv6myo,Gaza protesters descend on Chicago for Democratic convention,The four-day convention is set to celebrate Kamala Harris - but party divisions over Gaza could lead to disruption.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Democratic National Convention begins on Monday in Chicago, in what is expected to be a celebration of Kamala Harris's nomination as presidential candidate following Joe Biden's exit. However protests over the war in Gaza, led by Democrats from the party's left, threaten to disrupt the unity message. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected near the convention site to show their opposition to President Biden's policies towards Israel and Gaza, from which Ms Harris, his vice-president, has not deviated. There will also be events organised by pro-Israel groups, including a ""hostage square"" to draw attention to the plight of those who remain in Hamas captivity. Relatives of hostages are also expected to attend the convention. The four-day Democrat spectacle will culminate on Thursday with Ms Harris giving a primetime speech that will be watched by millions of Americans, fewer than three months before election day. President Biden, the former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and a list of actors and entertainers will give speeches at the United Center in Chicago. It comes a little over a month after Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination in Milwaukee, just days after surviving an assassination attempt and as Democrats were in disarray over 81-year-old Mr Biden's weakness as a candidate. Since then the momentum of the race has shifted significantly, with Ms Harris's entry to the race and her running-mate choice of Tim Walz, Minnesota's governor,  jolting enthusiasm and pushing them slightly ahead of Trump and his running mate JD Vance in national polls. What remains unclear is how the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party will tackle policy towards Israel and the conflict in Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza intending to destroy Hamas after the group attacked southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 people have since been killed in the campaign in the strip. Ms Harris has not released a clear policy on Gaza and Israel. She has, however, called for a ceasefire and for the respectful treatment of protesters at her rallies.  She also recently said ""far too many"" civilians had been killed but did not back a weapons embargo on Israel as some progressives have called for.  The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Opposition to the Biden administration's handling of the conflict caused more than 750,000 people to vote ""uncommitted"" - rather than for any specific candidate - during the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year.  While the energy of that campaign has ebbed slightly, the presence of that vote in key swing states such as Michigan would still be felt at the convention. Only three dozen delegates will represent the ""uncommitted"" vote and they will be greatly outnumbers by the more than 4,500 backing Ms Harris. However, they speak for hundreds of thousands of unsatisfied voters. In interviews, they said that they intended to spend the convention pressing the Harris campaign and their party to act more forcefully on Gaza. ""We know that this is not a small endeavour. We are challenging a status quo US policy of the past 40 years, and it won't shift overnight,"" said Samuel Doten, a Democratic organiser and ""uncommitted"" delegate. Several of the delegates said they hoped to convince fellow Democrats to sign a letter demanding Ms Harris and the party support a ceasefire and arms embargo against Israel.  They said they were not trying to spoil the convention or the election, but were rather pushing the party to adopt a policy popular among Democratic voters. ""There are thousands of voters across the US who voted 'uncommitted', so it feels like a huge responsibility for us to present their wishes and to make sure that their voices are being heard and amplified in this party,"" said Adrita Rahman, who will attend the DNC for the first time as an ""uncommitted"" delegate. It remains to be seen how many people will protest in Chicago against the Gaza war. Organisers had suggested  there could be 100,000, but have since said ""many, many thousands"" on Monday and ""tens of thousands"" in total by the end of the week. Monday's protests will take place before President Biden delivers the night’s main speech.  Ms Harris had earned some goodwill from Gaza protesters as she was one of the first members of the Biden administration to call for a ceasefire, and express a sharper opinion of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's prime minister. But many protesters said the the vice-president’s honeymoon period is over and  they expected to see a policy position that was actionable. ""The people inside the DNC need to know that they have some very unpopular policies. We're here to tell them,"" said protester Irene Alikakos at a protest on Sunday of a few hundred people near Chicago's Trump Tower.  The DNC will also coincide with a consequential week for the US-mediated ceasefire talks, which the White House has described as being in their ""final"" stages.  This diplomatic reality could put Ms Harris in a tenuous position. As a current member of the US administration, it is difficult for her to stray from Mr Biden's position on Gaza under normal circumstances. It is even more difficult with negotiations potentially coming to a close.   Some close to her have said that, either way, there would be no significant policy shift.  Halie Soifer, who was Ms Harris's national security adviser in the Senate, said there was ""no daylight between"" Ms Harris's views and Mr Biden's.  ""Her policy, which is the policy of this White House, is not changing,"" said Ms Soifer, who now leads the Jewish Democratic Council of America. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd05erlzxy3o,Rwandan president sworn in after 99% election win,Rights groups say the margin of Paul Kagame's victory is proof of the lack of democracy in Rwanda.,11 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Paul Kagame has been sworn in for a fourth term as Rwanda's president after winning 99% of the vote in last month's election. While some hail Mr Kagame for bringing peace and stability to his country after the 1994 genocide, others accuse him of running a repressive regime in a country where ordinary people are afraid to openly criticise him. Rights groups say the margin of his electoral victory is proof of the lack of democracy in Rwanda. Only two candidates were allowed to stand against Mr Kagame in the 15 July election.  In his four presidential elections, he has always gained at least 93% of the vote. Several African heads of states were among the many thousands who attended the ceremony in the packed 45,000 capacity Amahoro National Stadium in the capital, Kigali. In his oath of office, Mr Kagame vowed to preserve peace and national sovereignty, and to consolidate national unity. He also pledged to ""never use the powers conferred upon me for personal interests"". ""Should I fail to honour this oath, may I be subjected to the rigours of the law,"" he said. Mr Kagame has been the real power in Rwanda since his then rebel forces came to power at the end of the genocide in which some 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered, ousting the genocidal regime. Since then, Rwanda has been relatively stable, with Mr Kagame seeking to turn the country into the ""Singapore of Africa"". The capital is one of Africa's cleanest cities and is home to the African Basketball League, which is a partnership with the NBA. It hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2022 and international stars like Kendrick Lamar have played concerts there. Mr Kagame often criticises the West, yet he has also sought to build alliances, for example with the UK over the now scrapped policy of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, agreed with the former Conservative government. While life has improved in Rwanda, Mr Kagame is accused of destabilising the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Just days before the July election, a UN report said there were some 4,000 Rwandan troops in DR Congo, where they are accused of backing the M23 rebel group, fuelling a bitter row between the two countries. Under Mr Kagame, Rwandan troops have twice invaded DR Congo, saying they were pursuing Hutu militias linked to the 1994 genocide. Congolese President FélixTshisekedi was not among the African leaders at the inauguration.    In his speech, Mr Kagame appeared to criticise Mr Tshisekedi for failing to help defeat Rwandan rebels based in DR Congo.   Unless that changes, he said mediation efforts wouldn't work.   He didn't sound like a man ready to give into any pressure and stop backing the M23 rebels.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xlq0rg4yzo,Trump touts economic plan in battleground state rally,"In North Carolina, Trump spoke about the economy and took jabs at Democrats as the race for the White House tightens.",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Former President Donald Trump held a battleground state rally to tout his economic plan and recalibrate his campaign amid a tightening race for the White House.  In a 90-minute speech in Asheville, North Carolina, Trump pledged to bring down consumer prices and increase wages through permanent tax cuts, energy policy reforms and eliminating environmental protections.  The stop on Wednesday was the second rally for Trump in two weeks, marking a slower pace for the former president's campaign. He often veered off topic, leaning into attacks on political rival Vice-President Kamala Harris and once stating he was ""not sure the economy is the most important topic"" of the election.  Trump's speech did not unveil any new proposals. He vowed to ""rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again"" in his second term. He argued that Biden-Harris administration has ""broken"" the US economy, asking the crowd: ""Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe?"" Inflation in the US rose at the slowest pace in more than three years last month, marking relief for consumers - and a possible boon for the Harris campaign.  Trump also promised to lower energy costs by opening up more land for drilling, and pledged to reverse renewable energy and infrastructure projects approved by President Joe Biden.  Towards the end of his remarks he said he would leave in place the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He had previously tried to eliminate it while in office. Trump frequently went off message, criticising Ms Harris over immigration, crime and other issues, as well as targeting her as “not smart” and having “the laugh of a crazy person”. The Harris campaign responded with a statement saying Trump chose to ignore ""inconvenient facts"" about the economy in his speech. ""He lied. He rambled. He yelled. He said the economy is not an important issue,"" it said. Trump has been on the defensive in recent days, after the Democratic ticket got a boost of energy when Ms Harris replaced Mr Biden as the nominee.  Reports suggest the Trump campaign is trying to get their candidate back on message after several events in which the former real estate mogul has been less focused on policy. A new survey from the Cook Political Report suggests Ms Harris is erasing Trump's polling leads in multiple swing states.  According to the publication, she polls ahead of the former president in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The pair are tied in Georgia. The race remains very competitive ahead of the November election, however, and surveys also suggest that voters trust Trump on economic matters more than Ms Harris.  Ms Harris is due to travel to North Carolina on Friday to deliver a speech laying out her own economic proposals. Outside the Asheville venue where Trump spoke, supporters described to BBC News why they back the former president. ""I love the fact that he stands for his beliefs and he stands for his country,"" said Lisa Ramsey, an Asheville resident. Zach Young, from nearby Hendersonville, said the Biden administration has overseen ""three and a half years of suffering"". ""We need to get back on the right page. The country needs to be run like a business,"" he said.  The economic speech comes after the United Autoworkers Union (UAW) filed Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board over comments made by Trump and Elon Musk. In a conversation on X/Twitter on Monday, Trump praised Mr Musk for firing workers who went on strike. Trump said that if workers strike, ""you say ‘that’s OK, you're all gone. You're all gone.' So everyone is gone"". But federal law says companies cannot fire striking employees.  On Wednesday, the union said it planned to mobilise its one million active and retired workers to vote for Ms Harris.  The move gives her campaign momentum in swing states such as Michigan, where UAW members accounted for 9.2% of the state's votes for Mr Biden in 2020, the union said.  ""When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Sean O'Brien echoed those sentiments. Mr O'Brien spoke at last month's Republican National Convention, calling Trump ""one tough SOB"".   Before his comments with Mr Musk, the Republican candidate had expressed some labour-friendly remarks. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump cast his ballot in Florida's primary election. His vote was submitted during the early voting window.  He has previously been a critic of early voting, claiming without evidence that it makes elections vulnerable to fraud."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn511dgnjo,Why Trump and Harris both say 'no tax on tips',"Under the current law, employees are required to disclose all tips over $20 per month to their employer.",12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In the hotly divided US presidential campaign, a rare area of agreement has emerged: Workers’ tips should not be taxed. Former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was first out of the gate with the proposal, announcing it at a rally in June.  Vice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic opponent, came out in favour of the plan this weekend, earning her the nickname “Copy Cat Kamala” from the Trump campaign.  It is a proposal intended to win attention for the candidates from Americans who work in service industries – restaurant workers, bartenders, hairdressers, manicurists, taxi drivers and others, who often receive a significant portion of their income in tips.  Both candidates announced their support for the idea in Nevada, a state seen as a toss-up in the election. Restaurants and hotels employ more than 20% of the workforce in the state, which is known for its Las Vegas casinos. Mr Trump said he started to champion the policy after a waitress complained to him about her taxes. Republicans, who have long favoured lower taxes, adopted it as part of their official party platform and several bills are now circulating in Congress, backed by restaurant lobby groups.  Some Democrats also have voiced support - including President Joe Biden, whose press secretary said that he backed the idea a day after Ms Harris endorsed the plan. The discussion comes as electronic payments make tips easier to trace, raising the risk of failing to report or under-reporting such income, an historically common problem. For all the buzz that ending taxes on tips has generated, however, it is a relatively niche issue. Nationally, an estimated 4 million workers regularly receive tips – less than 3% of the overall workforce, according to an analysis by Yale University's Budget Lab. What’s more, a significant share of those workers – about 37% - earn so little that they do not currently pay income taxes to the federal government at all, the analysis found. Under the current law, employees are required to disclose all tips over $20 per month to their employer. The federal government then collects a share via income and payroll taxes, which fund programmes such as Social Security. (States also have their own rules about income tax.) Americans reported $38bn in tip income to the federal government in fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which there is data.  On average, that amounted to just over $6,000 in income per taxpayer.  For some servers, however, tips can account for more than half of their hourly earnings, according to estimates from the National Employment Law Project. The financial impact is unclear: Some of the proposals in Congress focus exclusively on income tax; others would exempt tips from both income and payroll tax.  The candidates themselves have been vague.  The Tax Foundation estimates that any change would cost at least $107bn over a decade and other estimates are higher. But though eliminating taxes on tips might sound straight-forward politically, some analysts say that does not make it good policy. They argue that it would unfairly shift the tax burden to workers who do not receive tips. It also could encourage tipping to expand to new professions, which could lead to a much bigger financial impact than expected. Others argue that cutting taxes on tips would benefit employers more than workers by distracting from the real issue: that businesses do not have to pay minimum wage to staff who receive tips."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9z0lm48ngo,Could Trump really deport one million immigrants?,The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would face legal and practical challenges - and cost billions.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"If  he’s re-elected president, Donald Trump has promised the mass deportation of people who do not have legal permission to be in the United States. While his campaign has given various answers as to how many could be removed, his vice-presidential nominee JD Vance gave one figure during an interview to ABC News this week. ""Let's start with one million,” he said. “That's where Kamala Harris has failed. And then we can go from there.” But even as it has formed a key plank of the Trump platform – with signs at his rallies reading “Mass Deportations Now!” - experts say there are significant legal and practical challenges to expelling so many people. Immigration advocates have warned that the human cost of deportations would also be significant, with families torn apart and raids taking place in communities and workplaces across the US.  The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005. Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade. Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs. Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement. However, many of the country’s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice. The Trump campaign has pledged to take action against these “sanctuary cities”, but America’s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.  Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a ""critical"" aspect of any mass deportation programme.  ""It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,"" she said.  As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.  ""There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,"" she said. ""That makes it so much harder.""  Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.  A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.  If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.  During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.  Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.  Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.  ""To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,"" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.  For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.  Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.  After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an ""alternative to detention"" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.  Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.  ""In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,"" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.  Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.  Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.  Aside from the use of the military and ""using local law enforcement"", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.  In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would ""not rule out"" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from ""the liberal groups or the progressive groups"".  He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not ""won't partake in the riches"".  ""We have to do this,"" he said. ""This is not a sustainable problem for our country.""  The BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for additional comment.  Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement. ""That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,"" he said. ""That's what keeps people showing up.""  Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary. ""They're coming for jobs,"" he said. ""And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.""   Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (£327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people. Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.  The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.  Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.  ""Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,"" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. ""A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.""  Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border. Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that ""nightmarish images"" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.  ""Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,"" Mr Isacson said.  ""You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,"" he added. ""All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.""  Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.  The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.  During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the ""deporter-in-chief"".  The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people. That figure is disputed by historians, however.  The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.  Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.  ""Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,"" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.  ""Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,"" she added.  ""Those are not comparable situations."" "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jl0p4vklyo,Why this Democratic convention will not be like Chicago in 1968,There are parallels - a president exiting the race and anti-war protests - but the violence and chaos of that event is unlikely to be repeated when Democrats convene in the city this week.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"When 21-year-old Indiana University philosophy student Craig Sautter drove to Chicago for the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he had an ""inkling"" that he would be in for a ""wild day"". There had been a series of riots after the back-to-back assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy just months before, and he could tell that simmering tensions were ready to boil over when thousands of protesters, police, politicians and delegates gathered that August to pick who would be the next Democratic candidate for president. Yet the young anti-Vietnam War activist was still shocked by what he saw: National Guardsmen with bayonets, protesters ripped from cars or beaten with police batons, and thick clouds of tear gas wafting through crowds of thousands. ""We were mostly middle-class kids, or business people who were there in suits, protesting against the war,"" Mr Sautter recalled. ""We never thought that the police would attack an unarmed group of people who were just singing and shouting... we were in disbelief."" Ultimately, more than 600 protesters were arrested and over 100 treated for injuries, alongside 119 police officers. Scenes of the violent clashes in the streets and parks of Chicago soon flashed on TV screens across the country, and the world, leaving an unforgettable image of America in chaos. ""People were chanting that the whole world was watching,"" added Mr Sautter, now a professor at Chicago's DePaul University who researches presidential conventions. The return of the DNC to Chicago in 2024 has led many to look back at 1968 and draw parallels. Like back then, there will be anti-war protests - this time against the Biden administration's support for Israel during the war in Gaza.  And like back then, there has been a surprising change of guard amongst Democratic leadership. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election months before the convention, while this time, President Biden pulled out of the race with merely weeks to go. But experts and veterans of the 1960s protest movement believe the differences far outweigh the similarities. Nonetheless, some of those involved in planning the anti-Gaza war protests at the upcoming DNC say they draw inspiration from the activists who took to the streets of Chicago nearly 60 years ago.  ""This is the Vietnam War of our era,"" Hatem Abudayyah, a spokesman for the Coalition to March on the DNC, told the BBC. ""The attacks on our movement, our students and our organisations are similar to the attacks on the movement that was trying to stop 1968... I absolutely see those parallels."" The coalition includes over 200 organisations involved in the protests, and its spokespeople have said that ""tens of thousands"" of participants are expected.  The size of the protests has prompted Chicago's police department to warn that it won't tolerate ""violent actors"" or incidents of vandalism or criminality.  Mr Abudayyah says there has been ""no evidence of any violence"" during protests organised by the coalition or its member groups since the conflict in the Middle East began 10 months ago. Others have dismissed any real similarities to 1968. ""Other than the fact that they're in Chicago, there are none,"" long-time Democratic National Committee member and DNC delegate Elaine Kamarck told the BBC. ""This is not even close."" One key difference, according to Ms Kamarck, is that the Chicago police employed ""very, very thuggish tactics"" 56 years ago. A federally-mandated commission later accused the force of a ""police riot"" at the DNC.  Just months before, then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had also issued ""shoot to kill"" orders in the wake of riots after Martin Luther King's death.  ""All hell was breaking loose,"" said Ms Kamarck, who was 18 at the time. ""There's no such thing going on now.""  Ms Kamarck's assessment was echoed by Marsha Barrett, a professor of US political history at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.  ""Daley had very strong control over police, and an antagonistic relationship with protesters,"" she said. ""The city had set up a situation where there was likely to be a major conflict.""  ""We don't have that now,"" she added.  Chicago police have been in regular touch with DNC protest groups and have vowed to protect their rights to free speech, provided that the protests remain lawful.  ""The understanding of police activity at that time was that the would use whatever force was needed to overcome resistance,"" said Mr Sautter.  ""Now the police are better trained,"" he added. ""They're not going to provoke anything unless some kind of violence breaks out.""  Among those who witnessed the violence first-hand was Abe Peck, then editor of the Chicago Seed, an underground newspaper linked to the Youth International Movement, or Yippies, that planned events around the 1968 convention. ""We were in our office, which was in a dry cleaners', and all of a sudden our window fragmented,"" remembers Mr Peck, who was later credited with creating the ""whole world is watching"" chant. ""Two shots were fired through it. Fortunately nobody was hit."" When they ran outside to investigate, Mr Peck saw only one vehicle: a Chicago police cruiser.  The incident was one of several which marked his experiences of the DNC, which also included the police ""stomping out"" religious ministers tied to the counterculture movement. That violence, Mr Peck told the BBC, stands in stark contrast to today. Social media and the immediate spread of news could create a public relations disaster if police were seen to be too aggressive. ""Back then, there was a real delay in getting news out. Now, it's essentially instantaneous,"" Mr Peck said. ""That's a big difference.""  Don Rose, who in 1968 was a spokesman for the National Mobilization Committee to End the War, one of the main protest groups, told the BBC that an even more significant difference was the Vietnam War itself.  That war, unlike the Gaza war, saw tens of thousands of Americans drafted, many of whom were killed or wounded overseas.  ""The country was far more divided on the Vietnam War at that time. The protests expanded greatly because of the draft,"" said Mr Rose, now 93.  ""We were protesting at a convention that would nominate someone who could end the war with the stroke of a pen,"" he added.  The Democratic Party at the time was also deeply divided over the war, and when delegates arrived at the DNC of 1968, they had no idea who would be leaving with the nomination.   When then-vice president Hubert Humphrey was finally chosen as nominee over anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy, some in the audience even shouted “No!”. ""The convention was totally divided, and at war with itself,"" explained Mr Sautter. ""For [Kamala] Harris and Walz, it's totally unified."" Mr Peck, for his part, said that more recent versions of the DNC can no longer be called ""nominating conventions"". ""These are just confirmation conventions,"" he said. ""They confirm what the people in states did at the primary levels. That's really different."" Ultimately, Hubert Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 election to Republican Richard Nixon. Looking back, Mr Sautter - who will be watching the convention on TV this year - believes that the protests of 1968 had an impact on the US that could never be replicated in 2024. ""People who watched were totally radicalised by it, and many, many more people became involved in trying to stop the war,"" he said. ""A whole generation, whether they were there or not, were marked by it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge9k0r1llo,Biden says Gaza protesters 'have a point' after thousands gather at DNC,A security fence was breached but most demonstrators taking to Chicago's streets remained peaceful.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest near the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on its opening day, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. But several demonstrators were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence around the Chicago venue. The turnout appeared to be well below the tens of thousands that organisers had hoped for and short of the 15,000 they claimed turned out. Later in the evening, President Joe Biden acknowledged that the protesters ""out on the street have a point"" in his primetime convention farewell speech. ""A lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides,"" he said, adding that a US-brokered ceasefire - which has so far proved elusive - was necessary. Protests in Chicago have highlighted divisions among Democrats over one of the most contentious issues on the left of American politics, US support for Israel’s war in Gaza. At one point during Monday's protest, a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators knocked down a fence around the convention security perimeter and streamed through. Chicago Police said the protesters did not breach an inner security fence and that the situation was quickly contained. At least four people were detained.  Many of the Gaza war demonstrators said they saw little difference between Mr Biden and his Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is formally accepting the Democratic White House nomination this week after the president dropped out of the race last month and endorsed her. “The Democratic Party may present a new face, but its support for Israeli repression remains unchanged,” said Omar Younes, a co-founder of Jisoor, a Palestinian youth organisation in Chicago. Another protester, Tallis George Munro, said he would definitely vote for Ms Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, but did not want to give them a “free pass” on their support for Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr Munro, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he was more worried about what he described as a ""bigger threat"" – the policies of Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""We are close to white Christian nationalism with Trump,"" he said. ""That is the biggest problem in this country now."" Other protesters told the BBC they would vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, or they would not vote at all.  The rally-goers also heard from independent presidential candidate Cornel West, a philosophy professor and left-wing activist. ""This is not about some Machiavellian politics or some utilitarian calculation about an election,"" he told the crowd. ""This is about morality.""  After months of legal wrangling over the route, protesters followed a 1.1 mile (1.8km) path around the DNC site, chanting slogans including ""No justice, no peace, US out of the Middle East"" and ""Kamala Harris is a cop, all this violence has to stop"" – a reference to the vice-president's career as a prosecutor and California attorney general. The demonstrators also chanted ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". This refers to the land between the River Jordan, bordering the occupied West Bank and Israel in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Anti-semitism monitors say it calls for the destruction of Israel but pro-Palestinian groups deny the slogan is hateful. Earlier in the day, a small contingent of pro-Israeli counter-protesters briefly rallied on the edge of Union Park, where the pro-Palestinian march began and ended. The march drew people from neighbouring states and further afield. Karyna Lemus attended as a member of the Colorado Springs People’s Coalition. She said she’s been involved in the Palestinian rights movement for decades. “I hope they hear us inside,” she said of the DNC delegates. Protests will continue for the rest of the week during the convention. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywey7z8edo,'Squad' member Ilhan Omar holds off primary challenge,Two other members of the progressive group of Democrats lost primaries earlier this year.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar has fended off a primary election challenge in Minnesota, avoiding a fate met by other members of her political ""Squad"". Ms Omar faced three challengers in the primary contest to determine the party's nominee, and will now continue on to the November election in the state's solidly Democratic-leaning 5th District.  The race had been closely watched after successful primary challengers elsewhere took down two fellow members of the ""Squad"" - a group of progressive Democrats who have been among the most vocal critics in Congress of Israel's war in Gaza. “We run the politics of joy,"" Ms Omar told supporters on Tuesday. She went on to say this was a case of fighting for healthcare, housing, and for a ""peaceful and equitable world”. Hers was one of several primary races on Tuesday in Connecticut, Wisconsin and Vermont, as well as Minnesota. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar also won her own primary in Minnesota. Ms Omar won her contest with more than 67,000 votes - or 56% of the overall share - according to tallies reported by US outlets, which say 99% of votes have been counted. Coming second was Don Samuels, a former member of the Minneapolis City Council who also narrowly lost to Ms Omar in 2022. He received just under 43% of the votes this time and said he was ""very disappointed"". Earlier this month, fellow ""Squad"" member Cori Bush of Missouri lost her primary race, and in June, Jamaal Bowman in New York was also defeated - both after pro-Israel groups poured millions into those races backing other Democrats.  The pair were elected in 2020 amid a year marked by racial justice protests after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.  Ms Omar did not suffer the same downfall as her political peers.  A so-called super-pac operated by the pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee appears to have stayed out of her race. It had spent millions in races against Mr Bowman and Ms Bush, according to data from Open Secrets, which tracks money in politics.  Super-pacs are independent political action committees that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate. The Intercept reported on Sunday that a last-minute effort by wealthy pro-Israel donors raised six-figure sums to help Mr Samuels. But opinion polls had been suggesting Ms Omar would fend off the challenge. One internal poll taken last month reportedly indicated she was ahead by 30 points.  Ms Omar has received help on the campaign trail from progressive Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is running for president.  Ms Omar, who was born in Somalia, is one of the first Muslims to be elected to the US Congress.  She had been an outspoken critic of Israel even before the war in Gaza.  She was removed by the Republican-controlled House from the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2023 over a number of comments she had made about Israel.   Democrats and Ms Omar said at the time it was revenge, after two Republicans were ousted from committees in 2020 when Democrats held a House majority. In 2019, Ms Omar seemed to suggest that Israel demanded ""allegiance"" from American lawmakers and that any criticism is viewed as antisemitic. She implied money was behind the support for Israel.  Ms Omar apologised for those remarks. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jpn2q76n1o,Trump's chat with Musk on X fact-checked,"In a two-hour discussion, Trump made a number of questionable and false claims which went largely unchallenged.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In a two-hour discussion with Elon Musk, on the billionaire's platform X, Donald Trump made a number of questionable and false claims - which went largely unchallenged.  The Republican presidential candidate returned to some familiar campaign themes, such as illegal immigration and rising prices, but he also talked about climate change. BBC Verify has been checking some of his claims.  CLAIM: “The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years.” VERDICT: According to climate projections, Trump is vastly underestimating the rise in sea levels.  In the decade 2014-2023, global average sea levels rose by an average of nearly 4.8mm per year (0.19in), according to the World Meteorological Organization. That increase is already greater than the one eighth of an inch (0.13in) that Mr Trump predicts will happen over the next 400 years. The magnitude of future rises is difficult to predict, because it is uncertain how quickly ice-sheets will melt, and future warming will depend on greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated a likely range of 0.28 to 1.01m of global sea-level rise by 2100 - although higher rises can’t be ruled out.  A sea-level rise of one metre would put hundreds of millions of people at risk of more regular coastal flooding, as well as submerging parts of low-lying countries such as the Maldives. CLAIM: “I think 20 million people have come across the border... I think millions are coming every month.” VERDICT: It isn’t possible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have entered the US across its southern border during President Biden’s time in office. Official data suggests it did hit record levels but not the kinds of numbers Trump claims. Since January 2021, the US Customs and Border Protection agency says there have been 10.1m encounters of illegal migrants by enforcement officers in the US, with more than 8m of those coming over the southern border. These figures don’t necessarily mean all these people successfully entered the US - some may have been sent back and the same person could be “encountered” trying to cross the border multiple times. The official figures do represent a significant increase on the four years under Trump, and it is also the highest figure recorded under any US administration. The data doesn't show ""millions"" coming every month either. US Border Patrol agents apprehended around 57,000 migrants along the southern border in July - the lowest recorded since September 2020. The numbers are down significantly from the peak under Mr Biden in December 2023, when around 250,000 migrants were caught crossing the border. CLAIM: “I think we have the worst inflation we've had in 100 years... bacon costing four or five times more than it did a few years ago”. VERDICT: This is false. Inflation peaked at 9.1% under President Biden - the highest in 41 years, not 100. The price of bacon is up 17% since Trump left office, not four or five times. Inflation rose significantly during the first two years of the Biden administration, reaching the highest level since 1981. This was comparable with many other Western countries, which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues as a consequence of Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. Some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) spending plan in 2021 was a factor as well. Since mid 2022, US inflation has fallen, with the latest monthly figure at 3% as of June. In terms of bacon - the average price for a pound of sliced bacon was $5.83 in January 2021 when Trump left office, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It now costs $6.83. CLAIM: ""I built hundreds of miles of wall"" to protect the southern border. VERDICT: The length of border wall built during Trump’s presidency depends on what you are measuring, but if you include new sections as well as parts that have been replaced or reinforced, he built more than 450 miles. A report by US Customs and Border Protection puts the total at 458 miles. However, only 85 miles of entirely new sections of wall were built under Trump. The rest has been either replacing or reinforcing existing barriers. President Biden suspended construction when he came into office, but last year his administration allowed the building of a section of wall in an effort to stop rising levels of immigration. The section approved by Mr Biden is for 20 miles of barriers along the border in southern Texas. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5r5yl624ko,Tim Walz has Irish roots - but where exactly?,Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz  is the latest American politician to have their roots traced back to Ireland.,18 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris' presidential running mate Tim Walz is the latest American politician to have their roots traced back to Ireland - but where exactly his ancestors are from is a matter for debate. The 41st governor of Minnesota's relatives are said to have hailed from County Wexford. American genealogist Megan Smolenyak, who has been tracking politicians' roots since Barack Obama first ran for president in 2008, believes his ancestors are from Ferns in the county. However, local genealogists are suggesting it is Kilmore which is about 52km (30miles) down the road. Ms Smolenyak told BBC News NI that Mr Walz was ""about 1/8th Irish"", pointing out that his ancestors moved to Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska. She said, according to records, Mr Walz's great-grandmother was called Laura Ellen Sullivan. ""A surname like Sullivan is a clear sign that you have Irish ancestry,"" she said. ""I started working backwards then following the trail from there.  ""His ancestor's name was Sullivan. I found James Sullivan who was from Ireland, his daughter was Laura Ellen Sullivan."" The hunt is now on for distant relatives of the man who could be another American in the White House with Irish connections. Whichever way the US presidential election goes, Fianna Fáil senator Malcolm Byrne from County Wexford is hoping a relationship can be built with Mr Walz. ""Certainly from a Wexford perspective, we'd like to develop the links with the governor of Minnesota,"" he said. ""There are a number of local historians and genealogists who are looking at the research that's being uncovered in the US. Originally we thought it may be from the town of Ferns that the connection was based. ""It is now possible it might actually be from the village of Kilmore, but there are certain connections between what would have been the Diocese of Ferns."" The Emerald Isle will almost certainly retain some representation in top level US politics when Joe Biden leaves the White House in January. Mr Walz becomes the second running mate with claimed ancestry from the island in this year's presidential election, after Donald Trump announced 'Scots-Irish hillbilly at heart' JD Vance as his pick for vice-president. And, of course, Joe Biden is inordinately proud of his own personal Irish heritage - he had ancestors in County Mayo and County Louth. He mentions it at every opportunity.  During the election campaign in 2020 he was asked for a ""quick word for the BBC"".  He swiftly replied: ""The BBC? I'm Irish!"" In 2021, the US Census Bureau stated that 31.5 million people in the United States reported having Irish ancestry - that is about 9.5% of the population. The New England region of the United States has the highest proportion of people claiming Irish ancestry, according to the US Census Bureau. The peak of Irish emigration came around the Great Famine where nearly two million people - about a quarter of the population - emigrated to the United States during a 10-year period. County Wexford can already claim one former president as John F Kennedy's family hailed from Dunganstown in the county. Each one of President Kennedy's eight great-grandparents was born in Ireland and moved to Massachusetts in search of a better life around the time of the Great Famine. Whether it is Kilmore or Ferns, for people in the county there is now an interest in how Tim Walz will do in the upcoming election. Dean of Ferns, Paul Mooney, is hopeful. He told BBC News NI: ""If Mr Walz is successful, I am sure that it would be seen as a positive for Ferns."" And Senator Byrne sees the Irish link as an opportunity to strength relations with the US.  ""I'm one of the conveners of the Ireland US Parliamentary Friendship group and we've always been looking at ways to support connections between US and Irish parliamentarians,"" he said. ""This is very positive in terms of trade, education, culture, tourism, all of those other links that that are really important."" "

Kennedy's claim of a New York address as his ""place of residence"" on nominating petitions was a ""false statement"", said Judge Christina Ryba. As a result, the petitions were considered invalid. Mr Kennedy has rejected the judge's ruling and vows to appeal. If the ruling is upheld, it would not only bar Mr Kennedy from the New York ballot but could also lead to challenges in other states where he uses that address.  Mr Kennedy dismissed the ruling as a partisan attack and noted the judge as a Democrat. “They aren’t confident they can win at the ballot box, so they are trying to stop voters from having a choice,"" he said in a statement.  ""We will appeal and we will win.” Mr Kennedy, 70, had argued in court that he considered New York his home since childhood and intended to return. He currently lives in California which he moved to in 2014 to be with his wife, Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines. In court, Mr Kennedy sought to make the case that he has been renting a bedroom from a friend in Katonah, roughly 40 miles (65 km) north of Manhattan. The friend, Barbara Moss, testified in court that she charges Mr Kennedy $500 (£301) a month. She also said there was no written lease.  Mr Kennedy also offered evidence of his residency by showing that he pays New York state taxes and has a law practice in the state. However, in her 34-page ruling, Judge Ryba said ""the overwhelming credible evidence introduced at trial"" suggested that Mr Kennedy only held a New York address for ""political standing"". “Given the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy’s testimony that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly improbable, if not preposterous,” the judge wrote. Mr Kennedy is the most well-known independent candidate but his popularity appears to have plummeted since Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris entered the race."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y573l77k3o,Arizona and Missouri to vote on abortion rights,Missouri enforced a near-total ban after the removal on US constitutional protection by the Supreme Court.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Arizona and Missouri are to vote on amendments that could enshrine access to abortion in their constitutions in November. A petition to put the issue before voters received far more signatures than required by both states' laws. The Arizona amendment, if approved, would codify a ""fundamental right"" to receive abortion care up until fetal viability, or about the 24th week of pregnancy, with exceptions to ""protect the life or physical or mental health"" of the mother. Missouri's amendment would reverse the state's near-total ban, which was brought in after the Supreme Court removed US constitutional rights to abortion.  Opponents of the Arizona initiative argue it goes too far and could lead to unregulated abortions in the state. Lawsuits to stop the measure from appearing on the ballot are expected. Arizona is one of many states where voters have considered or will consider a ballot initiative surrounding abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022.  So far, the measures have proved popular with voters - residents of California, Michigan, Vermont and Ohio voted to protect abortion rights by wide margins. Kansas and Kentucky voters also rejected referendums that would have stripped abortion rights. The Arizona Secretary of State's office said it certified 577,971 signatures - more than the 383,923 required to appear on the ballot in Arizona - in support of asking voters directly how abortion access in the state should look.  The petition represents the most signatures validated for a citizen-led initiative in state history, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said.  Arizona for Abortion Access — a coalition that includes the ACLU of Arizona and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona — led the months-long effort.  “This is a huge win for Arizona voters who will now get to vote YES on restoring and protecting the right to access abortion care, free from political interference, once and for all,” Cheryl Bruce, campaign manager for Arizona for Abortion Access, said in a statement. Abortions in Arizona are currently legal until the 15th week of pregnancy. After the 15th week mark, the law makes exception for the procedure to save a mother's life, but not for rape or incest. The certification of the abortion ballot initiative comes months after a national debate over an 1864 Arizona law that banned nearly all abortions in the state.  Arizona's Supreme Court reinstated the law - which makes performing an abortion punishable by two to five years in prison, except when the mother's life is at risk - earlier this year. The state's legislature repealed the Civil War-era ban.  Thirteen US states have outlawed abortion through so-called trigger laws following the Supreme Court's decision to end the constitutional right to an abortion.   Missouri is one of those states.  When Roe was overturned, a 2019 Missouri was triggered that prohibited abortion ""except in cases of medical emergency"".  The law made it illegal to perform or induce an abortion, punishable by five to 15 years in prison.  Voters in Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota will also vote on abortion rights in November. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n3pg157mo,MTV delays VMAs to avoid clash with US debate,"The Video Music Awards had been scheduled to take place on 10 September, but will now be a day later.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"MTV has delayed its annual Video Music Awards (VMAs) by a day to avoid clashing with the US presidential debate.  Former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris agreed last week to face each other in a televised debate on 10 September. The VMAs had already been scheduled for that date, but broadcaster MTV has announced the ceremony will now take place the following night. If both events had gone ahead on the same evening, it would almost certainly have damaged viewing figures for both events, but particularly the VMAs.  Interest in the debate is likely to be very high, especially as it is the only one currently scheduled between the two presidential candidates.  But the clash would also have posed an image problem for MTV, according to Billboard, due to the network's efforts to boost voter turnout.  MTV has encouraged its audience to engage more with politics as part of its brand since the 1992 election, which saw Bill Clinton unseat George HW Bush.  In addition to the presidential debate being hosted by ABC, Trump has suggested two further debates hosted by Fox News and NBC.  Harris has indicated she would be open to more debates, but none have yet been confirmed. Taylor Swift leads the field at this year's VMAs ceremony, with 10 nominations including artist, video and song of the year. At the 2023 ceremony, Swift won nine awards from 11 nominations, including video of the year for Anti-Hero.  Elsewhere, Post Malone has nine nominations this year, while Ariana Grande, Eminem and Sabrina Carpenter have six each. Other nominees include Megan Thee Stallion, SZA, Teddy Swims, LISA and Dua Lipa. The ceremony will take place on Wednesday 11 September at 17:00 PT / 20:00 EST, or 01:00 BST on Thursday for British viewers. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240815-miyake-events-the-giant-solar-superstorms-that-could-rock-earth,What if a giant solar superstorm rocked the Earth?,"The Sun is going through a period of high activity, but it is nothing compared to an enormous solar event that slammed into our planet 14,000 years ago.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Sun is going through a period of high activity, but it is nothing compared to an enormous solar event that slammed into our planet 14,000 years ago. If one were to occur today, the effect on Earth could be devastating. The oldest trees on Earth date back a whopping 5,000 years, living through all manner of events. They have stood through the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the birth of Christianity, the European discovery of the Americas and the first Moon landing. Trees can even be fossilised in soil underground, giving us a connection to the last 30,000 years. At first glance, these long-lived specimens might just appear to be static observers, but not so. They are doing something extraordinary as they grow – recording the activity of our Sun. As trees photosynthesise throughout the year, they change in colouration depending on the season, appearing lighter in spring and darker by autumn. The result is a year-on-year record contained within the growth ""rings"" of the tree. ""This gives us this really valuable archive of time capsules,"" says Charlotte Pearson, a dendrochronologist – someone who studies tree rings – at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona, US. For most of the 20th Century, dendrochronologists have largely used tree rings to investigate change across wide chunks of history – a decade or more. Yet at certain points in time, the change they document has been more sudden and cataclysmic. What they are finding evidence of are massive solar events that reveal disturbing insights into the turbulent recent past of the star at the centre of our Solar System. ""Nobody was expecting a brief event to appear,"" says Edouard Bard, a climatologist at the College de France in Paris. But in 2012 a then-PhD student called Fusa Miyake, now a cosmic ray physicist at Nagoya University in Japan, made an astonishing discovery. Studying Japanese cedar trees, she discovered a huge spike in a type of carbon known as carbon-14 in a single year nearly 1,250 years ago, in 774 CE. ""I was so excited,"" says Miyake. After doubting the data at first, Miyake and her colleagues soon came to an unnerving conclusion. The spike in carbon-14 must have come from something injecting huge numbers of particles into our atmosphere, since this radioactive isotope of carbon is produced when high-energy particles strike nitrogen in the atmosphere. Once linked perhaps to cosmic events like supernovae, studies have since suggested another probable cause: a monster burst of particles thrown out by the Sun. These would be generated by superflares, far bigger than anything seen in the modern era. ""They require an event that's at least ten times bigger than anything we've observed,"" says Mathew Owens, a space physicist at the University of Reading in the UK. The first recorded solar flare sighting dates back to the middle of the 19th Century, and are associated with the great geomagnetic storm of 1859, which has become known as the Carrington Event, after one of the astronomers who observed it, Richard Carrington. Miyake's discovery was confirmed by other studies of tree rings and analysis of ancient ice in cores collected from places such as Antarctica and Greenland. The latter contained correlated signatures of berylium-10 and chlorine-36, which are produced in a similar atmospheric process to carbon-14. Since then, more Miyake events, as these massive bursts of cosmic radiation and particles are now known, have been unearthed. In total, seven well studied events are known to have occurred over the past 15,000 years, while there are several other spikes in carbon-14 that have yet to be confirmed as Miyake events. The most recent occurred just over 1,000 years ago in 993 CE. Researchers believe these events occur rarely – but at somewhat regular intervals, perhaps every 400 to 2,400 years. The most powerful known Miyake event was discovered as recently as 2023 when Bard and his colleagues announced the discovery of a carbon-14 spike in fossilised Scots pine trees in Southern France dating back 14,300 years. The spike they saw was twice as powerful as any Miyake event seen before, suggesting these already-suspected monster events could be even bigger than previously thought. What causes the Northern Lights? Aurorae are caused when charged particles from the Sun are funnelled by Earth's magnetic field to the poles. Here, they collide with gases in our atmosphere, producing different colours as the clashes take place. The more powerful the solar event, the larger the aurorae can be. Earth's magnetic field can also be affected by the increased solar activity, causing a geomagnetic storm. The team behind the discovery of this superstorm from space had scoured the Southern French Alps for fossilised trees and found some that had been exposed by rivers. Using a chainsaw, they collected samples and examined them back in a laboratory, discovering evidence for an enormous carbon-14 spike. ""We dreamed of finding a new Miyake event, and we were very, very happy to find this,"" says Cécile Miramont, a dendrochronologist at Aix-Marseille University in France and a co-author on the study. Deep Impact If such an event were to occur again today, however, the impacts would be unprecedented. ""People who lived thousands of years ago would have probably seen aurora, they would have seen lights in the sky,"" says Pearson. ""They might have marvelled at that. But beyond that, this wouldn’t have impacted them at all. We're the first society on Earth that might witness one of these events who would be intensely vulnerable and massively impacted by it."" Our Sun today goes through periods of maximum and minimum activity on an 11-year cycle, during which it can fire out huge flares of plasma called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and huge explosions of radiation, called solar flares. If the Sun rotates a CME in the direction of Earth it can cause geomagnetic storms as charged particles flow into our atmosphere, unleashing aurora, known as the Northern and Southern lights. In May 2024, with our Sun heading towards its current solar maximum, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades produced aurora visible as far south as London in the UK and near San Francisco, California. (Read more about the effect solar storms have as they spill out across the solar system.) These storms can cause mayhem on Earth. Geomagnetic storms can swell our atmosphere, increasing atmospheric drag on satellites (the Hubble telescope dropped by 40-80m (141-262ft) a day during the geomagnetic storms in May 2024, for example). They can also play havoc with power networks, overpowering those that are not switched off in time, a fate that befell Quebec in 1989 when one of its power grids was knocked out for nine hours and left six million people – a quarter of Canada's population – without power. The most powerful solar storm in recent history, the Carrington Event of 1859, triggered intense auroral light shows in both hemispheres of our planet and triggered electrical surges that knocked out in telegraph lines around the world. Today, the effects of a Carrington-level event would be disasterious. In worst case scenarios, the Global Positioning System (GPS) could break down as satellites are pushed out of place or their delicate electronics damaged, while multiple power grids on Earth and even the internet could fail. In 2013, a report estimated the economic loss in the US alone from a Carrington-level event could be $0.6tn-$2.6tn (£0.4tn-£2tn). Miyake events, however, are a different beast – causing blasts of particles at least ten times larger than the Carrington event. In fact, so small was the Carrington event by comparison that any spike of carbon-14 it produced barely shows up in tree rings at all. In March, a study found a very subtle hint of carbon-14 from the Carrington event, but nothing compared to a Miyake event. ""It doesn't show up"", says Pearson. ""Either that means there's something different [going on], or [Miyake events are] on a much greater scale than the Carrington event. That's where the potentially dramatic side lies. If they are events like the Carrington event but just on a larger scale, we need some serious mitigation strategies as quickly as possible."" An event on the scale of the one that swept over the Earth 14,300 years ago could cause such widespread damage to the modern technology our lives rely upon it is hard to fathom. ""The Carrington event is presumed to be the worst-case scenario,"" says Raimund Muscheler, a solar scientist at Lund University in Sweden. ""So the question is, could they really be much worse?"" We know that some stars, particularly red dwarves which are smaller and dimmer than our Sun, are prone to superflares that can rip apart the atmospheres of planets orbiting nearby. While it's unlikely our Sun poses such a danger to Earth, the existence of Miyake events does raise the possibility that it is capable of bursts of much more extreme activity than the 11-year-cycle we observe today – and much more powerful than even the Carrington event. What's unclear at the moment is the link between Miyake events and geomagnetic storms. The carbon-14 spikes produced in the events likely come from bursts of highly energetic particles from the Sun. But it's not certain if these events are always linked to CMEs that cause powerful geomagnetic storms on Earth. ""When you have very big storms at the Sun, you often get a lot of energetic particles and CMEs,"" says Silvia Dalla, a solar physicist at the University of Central Lancashire. But she  notes the link is ""not exactly one to one"". Energetic particles can also stream from sunspots, twisted magnetic fields that cool portions of the Sun's surface and drive activity, but not all also produce large eruptions. Some researchers say there does not appear to be a correlation between Miyake events and sunspots. Intead they say the could be due to far more prolonged storms and bursts of solar activity that go on for a year or more. For our technology dependent world, that is deeply troubling. Confronted with such a barrage of high energy particle and radiation, all but the best shielded equipment could be vulnerable.   ""Satellites could be destroyed,"" says Muscheler. Infrastructure on Earth would be at risk too. ""You get particles that whizz through a chip and change one of the bits from a one to a zero,"" says Owen. It is something that occurs from time to time under normal conditions, leading to baffling and unexpected computer errors. But a Miyake event would cause so many that electronic systems would likely become unusable or even destroy the delicate circuitry. (Read more about the computer errors from outer space.) ""In something that's controlling the fuel going in and out of a nuclear power station, you really worry about that stuff,"" says Owens. ""In space weather we tend to talk about the one-in-100-year events, but the nuclear industry is often worried about the one-in-1,000-year events, the really big stuff."" Bursts of solar particles would play havoc with aviation too, causing flights to be diverted away from the poles where the incoming particles would be funnelled by the Earth's magnetic field, to prevent passengers being exposed to potentially harmful levels of radiation. But given these particles travel from the Sun to Earth at close to the speed of light, a journey of just eight minutes, there would be little time to prepare. ""You tend to know an event is ongoing more than you can really forecast them,"" says Owens. Sizing up the Sun Of course, tree rings only give us a snapshot of an entire year in which a Miyake event has occurred, so it's still unclear if the events would be the result of one single catastrophic solar burst, or multiple periods of increased activity over a year. ""We don't know whether that was one single event on one day, the superflare hypothesis, or there just happened to be an unusually large number of very big particle storms in that year,"" says Owens. Each of those storms, however, would still be large and potentially dangerous. Futher analysis of tree rings and ice cores to look for more Miyake events is ongoing in the hope it will provide more answers. ""I think more events are hidden,"" says Miyake. An estimated 95% of tree ring data from the past 5,000 years has been studied, says Nicolas Brehm, a solar scientist at ETH Zurich, a public research university in Switzerland, meaning it's unlikely there are many more Miyake events to be found in recent history. Beyond that, there is a limit of about 30,000 years worth of data in preserved wood, although that analysis is difficult. ""It's hard to get good material from this time period,"" says Brehm. More like this: Despite this, the hunt for more Miyake events goes on. In June, Bard returned to the French Alps to collect samples of more exposed fossilised trees. Now, with samples in tow, he will begin ""the tedious work"" of studying the tree rings, he says, over several months. Perhaps, one day, an even bigger event than that 14,300 years ago will be found. And of course there is still the chance one could happen again. We had better hope we are ready for it. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."

Skies above Cirencester and the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire turned purple on Monday evening and the sight was also spotted above Bristol and in Somerset.  The Aurora Borealis has been spotted more regularly in the UK over the last few months.  With enhanced solar activity continuing, BBC Weather says there will be more chances to see the aurora over the coming months. What are the Northern Lights? The Northern Lights - or aurora borealis - appear as bright, swirling curtains of lights in the night sky and range in colour from green to pink and scarlet. It is caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The colours occur due to different gases in the Earth's atmosphere being energised by the charged particles. The two most common gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen atoms glow green - the colour most often seen in the Northern Lights, while nitrogen atoms emit purple, blue and pink.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54l10z71lo,Son says Hasina will return to Bangladesh,Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India earlier this week following massive unrest.,10 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, will return to the country when elections are declared, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy says. Ms Hasina, who resigned and fled the country earlier this week following a massive unrest, is currently in India. Bangladeshi media say more than 500 people were killed in weeks of demonstrations against Ms Hasina. Many of them were shot by the police.  Thousands were injured in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971. “Absolutely, she will come [to Bangladesh],” Mr Wazed tells the BBC, saying his mother will return as and when the interim government decides to hold the polls. The military-backed interim government, headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, was sworn in on Thursday along with 16 advisers. Two of the student protest leaders are among the advisers. Mr Wazed is an information technology expert who now lives in the US.  He worked as an IT adviser for Ms Hasina for several years during her tenure as prime minister from 2009 to 2024. “She will certainly go back,"" her son says. ""Whether she comes back into politics or not, that decision has not been made. She is quite fed up with how she was treated."" The student-led movement started as a protest against quotas in civil service jobs last month before becoming massive unrest to oust Ms Hasina following a brutal police crackdown. Mr Joy is confident that when the polls are held, the Awami League, the party of Ms Hasina, will emerge victorious. “I am convinced that If you have elections in Bangladesh today, and if they are free and fair and if there’s a level playing field, then the Awami League will win,"" he says. Ms Hasina became prime minister for a fourth consecutive term in a controversial election held in January 2024.  The main opposition parties boycotted the election saying under Ms Hasina’s government there could not be “any free and fair election”. Her son termed the current interim government as unconstitutional and said elections should be held within 90 days. However, he was a bit circumspect about his political ambitions or whether he would return to the country to stand for the leadership of the Awami League, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh, and Ms Hasina. “No decision has been made in this regard. I never had political ambitions,” he says. But he adds that he was upset over the way the protesters had ransacked and set fire to their ancestral homes, including the museum dedicated to his grandfather in Dhaka. “Under these circumstances, I am quite angry, I will do whatever it takes,” he says. He says he is in touch with party supporters who are very upset and outraged over what happened in the past few weeks. “If 40,000 protesters or so can force the government to resign, then what happens if protests are held by the Awami League, which has millions of supporters?” he asserts. Ms Hasina and her sister (Rehana Siddiq) have been stranded in Delhi since Monday.  India has been a strong supporter of the Bangladeshi leader.  There have been reports she is trying to seek asylum in the UK, the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. “Those questions about her visa and asylum, they are all rumours,"" her son says.  ""She’s not applied anywhere. She’s staying put for the time being, watching how the situation unfolds in Bangladesh. “Her ultimate goal is always to go back home in Bangladesh.” Asked about well-documented human rights violations and extra-judicial killings during his mother’s 15-year tenure, he says some mistakes were made. “Of course, there were individuals in our government who made mistakes, but we always righted the ship,” he adds. “We had one minister’s son, who was a member of the special police force. He is in jail convicted of extra-judicial killings. That’s unprecedented.” “My mother tried to do the right thing in terms of arrests,” her son insists."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx924r4d5yno,"Where Kamala Harris stands on 10 key issues, from immigration to guns",Some of the vice-president's views have changed since she first entered politics.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has been riding high on a wave of favourable polls and energetic rallies since she became the Democratic Party's nominee for president, and selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  She released a detailed policy guide in early September offering voters a sense of what a Harris-Walz administration might look like.  This focuses on her economic and foreign policy agenda, and highlights her most urgent priority to tackle the cost of living.  Here are her key policy pledges. As vice-president, she has been Mr Biden's partner in passing major economic legislation - regularly labelled ""Bidenomics"" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy. Growth and jobs creation have been strong but inflation and high interest rates continue to hit American wallets. In a convention acceptance speech focused on the economy, Ms Harris promised mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation. She said in her speech that her plans would create ""an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed"". In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN, Ms Harris said that ""one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class"", a theme that she has repeated on the campaign trail. Ms Harris's position on the border has changed over time to a more moderate one in this campaign. On the campaign trail, the vice-president has reiterated her continued support for the hardline bipartisan border security deal that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction.  It was torpedoed by congressional Republicans earlier this year at Trump's urging. It would have fast-tracked decisions on asylum cases, limited humanitarian parole, and expanded the authority to deport migrants. Part of her policy proposal is to revive the border security bill and sign it into law.  She has also said there ""should be consequences"" for people who cross the US border unlawfully, though she once held a much more lenient position. As vice-president, she was tasked with tackling the root causes of the record numbers of Central American migrants crossing the southern border. Those numbers spiked during the Biden administration, but have declined in recent months. She helped raise $3bn - largely from private companies - for regional investments in hopes it would encourage residents to remain in their home countries. Ms Harris has long supported women's right to an abortion. She has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. “When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,” she said at a rally for her 2024 campaign in Atlanta, Georgia. She has reiterated that commitment several times, including during the ABC News debate with Donald Trump. In her policy proposal, Ms Harris wrote she would ""never allow a national abortion ban to become law"".  Ms Harris was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and she toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to address state abortion bans - often framing the issue as one about personal freedom. Ms Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since she was elected to the US Senate. As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries. She attended the Munich Security Conference in the past year, and delivered remarks in support of western security alliance Nato that denounced isolationism and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ms Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”, and represented the US at Kyiv's “peace conference” in Switzerland. In her speech at the Democratic convention, she noted that she met President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""warn him about Russia's plan to invade"" five days before Russia invaded, and ""helped mobilise a global response"" after the war began.  The vice-president also pledged, if elected, to ensure that ""America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century"" and to shoulder the responsibility of US leadership. Ms Harris has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution, and she has called for an end to the war in Gaza. In her convention acceptance speech, she pledged as president to ensure ""that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination"". While serving as vice-president, she was one of the first members of the administration to call for an ""immediate cease-fire"", raise concerns over the ""humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians"" and charge Israel with ending the conflict.  She raised these issues in what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July. She has not supported an arms embargo on Israel, however, as some on the US left have called for.  And when she debated with Trump, she said: ""I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people."" At the party convention, she said she would ""always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself"". In her CNN interview, Ms Harris indicated that she would focus on securing a ceasefire deal, which was President Biden's approach. In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes, co-sponsoring a bill with Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments. As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%. This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also supported, of an increase to 28%. A campaign official told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal of not raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (£310,000).  During her acceptance speech after being confirmed as the Democratic candidate, she said she would ""pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans"". At the time of the speech, the details of the tax cut were unclear.  The Harris campaign later filled in the detail, saying that through the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit more Americans will be able to keep more of their income.  Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 tax cut.  Ms Harris held fairly progressive views about health care earlier in her career. She supported expanding publicly-funded health-care programmes in the US that cover the elderly, youth with disabilities and poor.  This included backing Medicare-for-All, a progressive priority that would make all health care publicly funded. She later walked that position back. Her campaign told the BBC that she would not push for a single-payer system if elected to the White House.  While vice-president, the White House has had health care successes. It reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage. On the campaign trail, she has said that she wants to erase billions of dollars in medical debt for Americans and would work with states on the issue. Details of the plan remain thin, but when she was California's attorney general, Ms Harris often used anti-trust laws to keep insurers, hospitals and drug companies to address costs. Ms Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, then California's attorney general.  Her offices increased conviction rates, particularly of violent criminals, though that history led to criticism from the progressive left, which at times labelled her ""a cop"" - though the right has accused her of being soft on crime. Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. She made mention of his conviction and him being found liable for committing sexual abuse in her Democratic party conference acceptance speech. As a prosecutor, Ms Harris defended California's climate laws and sued oil companies for environmental damage. She also called for climate change policies via a ""Green New Deal"" during her 2020 presidential campaign - some of which has come to fruition under the current administration.  During a CNN town hall in 2019, she said that ""there is no question I'm in favour of banning fracking"", which is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock that can be damaging to the environment. But she has gone back on that stance. During the presidential debate, she said she cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act - which opened up new leases for fracking companies - in addition to funnelling hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programs.  ""My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil,"" she said. Ms Harris said she will protect public lands and public health, lower household energy costs and hold polluters accountable to secure clear air and water if elected in November, according to her policy platform.  Ms Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career, and she successfully defended California's gun laws when they faced legal challenges as the state's attorney general.  As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and earlier this year announced resources to support the implementation of red-flag laws, which are aimed at keeping firearms from those who may harm themselves and others.  She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programs.  Her policy platform includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as a requirement for universal background checks.  During the debate she noted that both she and her vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz are gun owners."

From Wakefield to Whitby, the light display turned the skies purple and green and coincided with the Perseid meteor shower. Across Yorkshire, BBC Weather Watchers have sent in dozens of photos captured over the past 48 hours. While Monday's strong geomagnetic storm has eased, Met Office Space Weather forecasts said there could be a slight increase in activity again later for those still hoping to catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis. The Northern Lights appear as bright, swirling curtains of lights in the night sky and range in colour from green to pink and scarlet. They are caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. The phenomenon is most commonly seen in regions close to the North Pole like Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, Canada and Russia. Experts said the most impressive light shows happen when the Sun emits  especially large clouds of particles called coronal mass ejections. For the best possible view, experts advise getting to an area where there are dark skies, away from street lights and where you can get a clear view of the whole night sky.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0ggk28lo,JD Vance and Tim Walz agree 1 October VP debate,The two vice-presidential candidates will face off in a debate hosted by CBS in New York.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Vice-presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz have agreed to a debate on 1 October. CBS said the debate in New York would be moderated by journalists Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, adding: ""We look forward to... providing voters with an opportunity to hear directly from the vice-presidential candidates."" ""See you on October 1, JD,"" Kamala Harris's running mate Mr Walz posted on X on Wednesday.  Mr Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, then on Thursday announced his agreement to the October date.  In his X post, Mr Vance challenged Mr Walz to a separate CNN debate on 18 September.  ""I look forward to seeing you at both!"" Mr Vance posted on X.  Mr Walz has not yet commented on the possibility of a second meet up.  Trump and Ms Harris, meanwhile, have agreed to a debate on ABC on 10 September. ""I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump,"" Ms Harris said last week. ""I hear he’s finally committed to it and I’m looking forward to it."" Trump had initially said he would only debate his opponent on Fox News. Ms Harris rejected those conditions, arguing that the Trump campaign had already agreed to ABC when it was presumed Joe Biden would be the Democratic nominee. During a press conference last week, Trump said: ""We think we should do three debates"", and suggested two additional debates against Ms Harris that he said would be hosted by Fox News and NBC. The Harris campaign has not specifically commented on the other two debates proposed by Trump.  Ms Harris has said she would be open to additional dates, though her campaign said last week that ""Trump has to show up"" to the ABC debate before they confirm any further showdowns.  NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate this autumn, the New York Times reported. Mr Biden's poor debate performance against Trump in June triggered the crisis over his candidacy that ultimately led to calls for him to drop out of the race ahead of November's election."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l5n2gy74vo,Biden explains why he dropped out of White House race,"The president says his candidacy would have been a ""real distraction"" for Democrats and that his highest priority was to defeat Donald Trump.",11 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US President Joe Biden says he dropped out of his re-election bid because he feared that the intraparty battle over his candidacy would be a ""real distraction"" for Democrats and that his highest priority was to defeat Donald Trump in November. In his first interview since quitting the race,  Mr Biden, 81, said he had “no serious problem” with his health. He blamed his poor debate performance on being sick at the time, and brushed off concerns about his age and mental acuity. The US president pledged to campaign for Kamala Harris saying he was going to do whatever his vice-president ""thinks I can do to help most"". “We must, we must, we must defeat Trump,” he told US broadcaster CBS News. Mr Biden said if he had continued his campaign, the presidential contest would have gone “down to the wire”. ""A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,"" he said. ""And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic. You’d be interviewing me about, Why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did so — and I thought it’d be a real distraction.” Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi was widely reported to have led the push to oust Mr Biden - a claim she has not exactly denied - after his halting debate performance against Trump on 27 June. During the pre-recorded interview broadcast Sunday, Mr Biden misspoke several times but generally seemed more coherent than during the live televised debate. He chalked up his poor debate performance to illness – previously he’s also mentioned jet lag and lack of rest as factors. As pressure continued to ratchet up, he announced his exit from the race on 21 July. A potential battle to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket never materialised and party support swiftly coalesced around Vice-President Harris, who has so far outperformed Mr Biden in opinion polls. The president has said he intended to be a bridge to the next generation when he ran for the White House in 2020. ""When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.” In other US election news:  In the CBS interview, Mr Biden returned to the moment he decided to run against Trump – when a gathering of far-right activists in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 turned deadly. He accused Trump of emboldening racists and the far-right. “Every other time the Ku Klux Klan has been involved they wore hoods so they're not identified,” he said. “Under his presidency, they came out of those woods with no hoods, knowing they had an ally.” He also repeated his concerns about what might happen after November’s election, saying he was “not confident at all” that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Ms Harris defeats Trump. He went on to say that he was concerned that there would be violence if Trump loses the election. ""He means what he says,” Mr Biden said. “We don't take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about, 'If we lose, it'll be a bloodbath’.” ""He's a genuine danger to American security,” Mr Biden said. Trump commented at a rally in March that it would “be a bloodbath for the country” if he loses, however his campaign has repeatedly said he was referring to the economy and the auto industry and that Democrats have taken the quote out of context. At the same time, the former president has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that he was cheated out of victory in 2020 and has warned that there will be attempts to “rig” the vote this year. He has pledged to pardon some or all of the people convicted for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021. Mr Biden said he would be campaigning on behalf of Ms Harris and that he had spoken to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro about  touring the state. Mr Biden was born in the working-class city of Scranton, about 120 miles (190km) north-west of New York City. “I'm going to be campaigning in other states as well. And I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,” he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge30ze4dpo,Trump campaign says its internal messages hacked by Iran,"The FBI said it is investigating the allegation, which came in the wake of a Microsoft report into Iranian hacking.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump’s campaign has said some of its internal communications have been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives. US news website Politico reported on Saturday that it had been emailed campaign documents including internal research carried out on Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance. A Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by ""foreign sources hostile to the United States"". In a statement to US media, Iranian officials denied any connection to the hack. Politico said it had confirmed the authenticity of the documents. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. The Trump campaign did not give any further details or any evidence linking the document leak to Iranian hackers or the Iranian government. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Monday that it is investigating the incident.  The Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June. Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear phishing email – a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link. “Over the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,” the MTAC report said. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the June hacking attempt mentioned in the MTAC report “coincides with the close timing of President Trump’s selection of a vice presidential nominee"". “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,” Mr Cheung said. He said the hack was ""intended to interfere with the 2024 election"". A spokesman for Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations said in a statement to the Washington Post: “We do not accord any credence to such reports.  ""The Iranian Government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election."" Politico said that in late July it began receiving emails from a person who identified themselves only as “Robert” using an AOL email account. The news outlet said the Vance file was 271 pages long and based on publicly available information about Vance’s past record and statements. The email account also sent part of a research document about Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also a vice presidential contender, it said. Presidential campaigns routinely research potential vice-presidential nominees in order to ferret out any potentially embarrassing revelations. Politico reported that some of Mr Vance's previous - and well-known - criticisms of Trump were labelled in the document as ""potential vulnerabilities"".  The Microsoft report noted: ""Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles."" Microsoft had released a similar report during the 2020 election saying Iranian hackers had targeted presidential campaigns.  US security sources have also warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month’s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1k3mwy1ww3o,Musk's X talk with Trump hit by tech glitches,"Mr Musk, the billionaire owner of X, blamed the glitches on a cyber-attack but one expert told the BBC that was unlikely.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Elon Musk's much-anticipated discussion with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the billionaire’s platform X was marred by technical issues. The conversation, in which Mr Musk asked friendly questions on subjects such as immigration and inflation, began more than 40 minutes late as many users struggled to gain access. The event was billed as an interview but Trump made a series of unsubstantiated claims that went without challenge. Mr Musk repeated his endorsement of Trump, who faces a resurgent new Democratic candidate, Vice-President Kamala Harris, in November’s election. He blamed the glitches on a cyber-attack but one expert told the BBC that was unlikely. The conversation on X comes as Trump, the former president and Republican presidential nominee, is trying to reset his re-election campaign.  The entry of Ms Harris after President Joe Biden stepped aside has tightened the race for the White House.  Mr Musk meanwhile has become an increasingly influential voice in politics.  He has recently become involved in a new political committee supporting Trump's campaign.  ""America is at a fork in the road and you are the path to prosperity and I think Kamala is the opposite,"" said Mr Musk in one exchange. The two men touched on a range of issues, from the assassination attempt on Trump last month at a Pennsylvania rally, to his wanting the US to get an ""Iron Dome"" missile defence system like the one in Israel as well as immigration, a key plank of his campaign.  Trump also mused about closing the federal Department of Education and moving that responsibility to the states as one of his first acts if he wins the election in November.  The relationship between Mr Musk and Trump has shifted over the years and they have traded online barbs in the past.  But Monday's conversation between the two was chummy and there was a lot of mutual praise. Trump, who has been sceptical of electric vehicles and previously vowed to roll back federal subsidies, praised car-maker Tesla, which Mr Musk also owns. He recently said he had “no choice” but to support EVs because of Mr Musk's endorsement and called the Tesla product ""great"" on Monday. Many observers detected a difference in Trump's voice which sounded like he had a lisp, but a spokesman for the Trump campaign said it was no different from normal. However the Musk-Trump conversation got off to a less than auspicious start.  As many users struggled to access the livestream, Mr Musk blamed ""a massive DDoS attack on X"" for the problems in a post.  Distributed denial of services attacks - or DDoS attacks - are attempts to overload a website to make it hard to use or inaccessible. “A DDoS attack sends a very large number of signals to an online target to disrupt it,” Anthony Lim, Director of the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace and International Studies in Singapore, told the BBC. “It is unlikely it would affect only one single service or feature on a website.” Mr Lim added that it is possible that a large number of people trying to listen could have temporarily crashed the service. However, Andrew Hay from IT firm Damovo said the problems could have been caused by a cyber-attack. The glitchy beginning was reminiscent of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' entry into the White House race in May 2023, which was held on X and saw the livestream malfunction. Monday marked something of a return to X/Twitter for Trump, who was removed from the platform shortly after the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot.  Besides a flurry of campaign advertisements on Trump's account on Monday, he had only posted once - his mug shot and a link to his campaign site - a year ago after Mr Musk reactivated his X account in 2022.  It's not clear whether Trump, who frequently posts on his Truth Social site, would continue to post more frequently on X.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lmm2wwlyo,Trump falsely claims Harris crowd was faked,"The Republican presidential candidate wrongly said AI was used on a photo showing thousands at a Harris rally in Detroit, BBC Verify reports.",12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump has falsely claimed a crowd which gathered to see Vice President Kamala Harris speak in Michigan last week “didn’t exist” and an image showing it was AI generated. The picture in question shows a large crowd at the Democratic presidential nominee's rally in Detroit. Mr Trump, the Republican taking on the vice-president in November's election, said on his Truth Social platform that it was a fake and there was “nobody” there waiting for her. However, in multiple other images and videos, some taken by people present but also by TV news teams and agency photographers, you can see a large crowd of people at the event. BBC presenter Sumi Somaskanda took the picture below at the rally and says: “People were literally packed in and the crowd stretched out onto the airfield.” Several of other photographs taken at the event by Getty Images show a large crowd there. Video footage taken by several independent media organisations, including NBC News and PBS, show similar scenes. Local media outlet MLive covered the event and estimated that about 15,000 people were at the rally which was held at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Many people who were also there posted pictures on X which showed them in a big crowd, including a Michigan state Democrat lawmaker who said there were “throngs of people”. The first version we could find of the photo Mr Trump has highlighted was posted on X by a Harris campaign staffer, Bhavik Lathia, on 7 August. Mr Lathia says the picture was sent to him by another campaign official. The Harris campaign confirmed this and sent us what they say was the original photo below. BBC Verify checked the metadata of this image, which confirmed it was taken on an iPhone 12 Pro Max device on 7 August at 18:28 local time. “I can confirm that this was taken by Harris campaign staff and not modified by AI in any way,” a campaign official told the BBC. The campaign also sent us several other images taken by the same person at the same spot, including the one below. This image was taken a minute earlier from the same angle, in which the same crowd is visible but covered in shadow. We’ve asked the Harris campaign whether the image which was questioned by Mr Trump was brightened to expose the crowds covered by shadow or changed in any other way. There’s no evidence that the Harris campaign edited the image to make the crowd appear larger. There have also been suggestions online that several elements of the photo show it has been manipulated using AI. These include the absence of a crowd in a reflection on the side of the plane, and that there is no identification number on the plane’s tail. On the first point, other photos taken by news agencies show the same view in the reflection on the side of the plane without a visible crowd. A Getty photograph taken from the reverse angle looking towards the crowd shows a clear area on the tarmac in front of the plane as Ms Harris and her running-mate Tim Walz walk away from it. It is possible that the reflection on the side of the plane is mainly of this area of empty tarmac. Questions have also been raised online about why there is no identification number on the tail of Air Force Two - the vice president’s plane. However, the number is also absent from other pictures taken at the Detroit event, and footage of the plane at other events recently also show it without a number on its tail. Prof Hany Farid, a specialist in image analysis at UC Berkeley, has examined the photograph using software designed to detect AI-generated images and says “we found no evidence that this image is AI-generated or digitally altered”. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

The song My Heart Will Go On - which featured in a 1997 film about the doomed ship Titanic -  was played to supporters before Trump appeared on stage at a rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday.  In a statement released on X, Dion's team said she did not ""endorse"" the use of the song, adding: ""And really, that song?"" Artists and bands including Neil Young, Queen and the Rolling Stones have previously complained about Mr Trump using their songs at campaign rallies. The statement said: ""Today, Celine Dion's management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc, became aware of the unauthorised usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing My Heart Will Go On at a Donald Trump / JD Vance campaign rally in Montana. ""In no way is this use authorised, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use. ""...And really, that song?"" The Trump campaign has not responded to the statement.  My Heart Will Go On is one of five-time Grammy winner Dion's best-known songs. The Oscar-winning ballad was on the soundtrack of the 1997 blockbuster Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as two lovers who meet on the doomed ship's maiden voyage in 1912. Dion made a triumphant return to live singing last month at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. It was her first performance since revealing she had been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) in 2022. SPS is a rare neurological disorder that causes muscles to spasm and can be debilitating. The singer discussed her struggles with SPS in a film called I Am: Celine Dion, which Amazon Prime Video said last month had become its most successful documentary ever. The Canadian artist Neil Young has also previously objected to Trump using his songs, and in 2020 the Rolling Stones threatened him with legal action after the song You Can't Always Get What You Want was played at a political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne sent a notice to Trump banning him from using Black Sabbath music in campaign videos in 2019.  The Republican Party's presidential candidate is not the only politician to receive criticism from artists over the use of songs during campaign rallies.  Last year, rapper Eminem asked aspiring Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to stop using his songs. Bruce Springsteen castigated President Reagan for planning to use Born in the USA for his 1984 election campaign. Fatboy Slim furiously denounced the UK Labour Party for using his hit Right Here, Right Now at their 2004 conference - the year after the Iraq War.  Legally, US politicians do not always need direct permission from artists.  Their campaigns can buy licensing packages from music rights organisations giving them legal access to more than 20 million songs. However, artists have the right to remove their music from that list. "

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gdjjlydp4o,Trump attacks Harris over US border policing – was it her job?,"Critics call the vice-president a ""failed border tsar"" - but supporters say that was not her mission.",14 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"From its opening line, Donald Trump’s first television advertisement blasting rival Kamala Harris took aim at what his campaign believes is her biggest weakness - immigration. “This is America’s border tsar,” a narrator said, over images of the vice-president dancing, “and she’s failed us.” A series of statistics followed, illustrating what the Trump campaign says took place under Ms Harris, who was given a role in dealing with the border crisis by President Joe Biden soon after his inauguration. The figures in the video ranged from 10 million illegal border crossings to 250,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths. The voice concluded: “Kamala Harris: failed, weak, dangerously liberal.” The Harris campaign responded that the former president was running on “his trademark lies”. It comes as little surprise that the Trump campaign took its first big swing at Ms Harris as the “failed border tsar”, blaming her for the high numbers of undocumented immigrants at the US southern border. Americans have consistently said in polls this year that immigration is a top problem facing their country, and it will weigh on many of their minds when they cast ballots for the next US president in November. Since that first ad, Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly labelled Ms Harris the “failed border tsar”, and tied her to relentless images of people wading across the Rio Grande or squeezing under razor wire into the US.  Her critics say she should have found a way to address the issue over the past four years. But “border tsar” is a contested term. Allies and former officials who worked with the vice-president say she was not given responsibility for policing the border. “It was never that position,” said Ricardo Zuniga, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of Western Hemisphere Affairs. “She knew from the beginning, as did the entire US government, that it was about tackling migration at its source.” In early 2021, President Biden gave Ms Harris the unenviable brief of dealing with the “root causes” of Central American immigration. At the time, people were fleeing a perfect storm of gang-related violence, economic ruin and environmental disasters in a region called the Northern Triangle - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  Talking to migrants passing through Mexico, it was clear that most came from Honduras where, they said, a brutal “narco-dictatorship” was in power and wages were as low as five dollars a day. While the ultimate aim of the Harris role was to reduce the numbers of people arriving at the US border, Mr Biden never used the words “border tsar” in announcing her appointment. “She is the most qualified person to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle in stemming the movement of so many folks to our southern border,” Mr Biden said at the time. Still, many people came to see the assignment as all-encompassing. Several media organisations, including the BBC, described Ms Harris as a “tsar” in news reports. Some commentators in Central America and Mexico questioned her qualifications, given Ms Harris had no prior experience in Latin American affairs. Tsar or otherwise, the job was a daunting, thankless task. Successfully dealing with decades of underinvestment and the region’s deep-seated economic and political strife would require huge amounts of money, along with goodwill and cross-party cooperation. That’s in woefully short supply in Washington, especially when it comes to immigration. “The idea that any one US administration is going to alter 500 years of history in Central America in a four-year period is ludicrous,” says Ricardo Zúniga. As the former lead US diplomat on the Northern Triangle, he maintains the Biden administration did make in-roads to Central America’s problems. He points to Ms Harris’s help raising $5bn (£3.9bn) from the private sector for job creation and entrepreneurship in the region. Several former members of her team recount how she personally called CEOs, persuading them to put in funds. During her visit to Guatemala and Mexico in June 2021, I saw Ms Harris try to show a kinder face, following four years of Donald Trump’s harsh rhetoric. She said she appreciated that people were fleeing “hunger, hurricanes and pandemic” and went on to set up a Central American corruption task force. That trip, though, is most remembered for her stark message to all prospective migrants: “Do not come. If you come to our border, you will be turned back.” Millions ignored her warning. Roughly two years later, in December 2023, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers had 300,000 encounters with undocumented immigrants at the US southern border. Many who have governed along the border in recent years take a dim view of Kamala Harris and her work in Central America. “Whatever she was doing diplomatically in other countries, I wouldn’t call it very effective based on what we saw here at the actual border,” says Douglas Nicholls, the Republican Mayor of Yuma, Arizona. “We had record numbers of people, numbers that far exceeded anything we’d ever seen before, including over three times the population of my city in one year. Those were scary numbers.” The vice-president is a “legitimate” target on the issue, which he says is not “a made-up excuse to whip up support among the base.” “It should have been addressed a lot earlier than it was,” says Mayor Nicholls. Others suggest the funds Ms Harris helped raise had only a small impact on the major incentive driving people north - being paid in US dollars. Ricardo Barrientos, the director of the Central American Institute of Fiscal Studies, said US private-sector investment paled in comparison to the remittances Central American migrants send home: $37 bn last year alone. ""It's very small compared to the magnitude of the challenge. Some would say, 'too little, too late',"" he said. But Katie Tobin, who worked on immigration at the White House, says Ms Harris’s work has been deliberately “misconstrued and painted in a bad light“. Ms Harris deserves credit for “a good news story” in Central America, she says. She points to statistics showing a 72% drop in immigration from just Central America between March 2021, when Ms Harris took on the role, and June 2024. Ultimately, the view of Ms Harris’s record may simply split along party lines. In recent months, the overall number of undocumented migrants has plummeted.  This is partly due to an executive order issued by President Biden allowing migrants in the US illegally to be deported without processing their asylum requests. There are also more legal pathways into the United States for prospective migrants.    Ms Harris’s defence is  primarily to point to Trump’s resistance to getting a bipartisan deal on immigration reform through Congress. In February, lawmakers reached the deal after intense wrangling, where Democrats ceded much ground to Republican positions. Republican leaders then blocked it at Trump’s behest, reportedly because he did not want to give the Biden administration a win. “It was Trump himself who, for very openly political reasons, undermined an agreement that would help stabilise the border,” says Mr Zúniga. “So, the Trump campaign is kind of in the way of their own argument on this.” Mayor Nicholls in Yuma is not moved by that defence, saying:  “I think that’s a very short-term memory."" He recalls contacting the Trump White House at a moment of crisis. He was invited to discuss immigration directly with the president and the Homeland Security secretary in a meeting where he was given more resources. Three months later, he says “we were out of that crisis”. “That is effective leadership on the border,” he adds. Still, Ms Tobin says the Harris campaign should talk about it more.  “When there’s a vacuum and the vice-president doesn’t talk about immigration, it creates an opportunity for Republicans to fill the airwaves with disinformation.” The Harris campaign responded to Trump’s first advertisement with some of its own. The first focussed on Trump’s opposition to the immigration deal, and accused him of trying to stop her from fixing the ""broken"" immigration system.  A more recent one has put the spotlight on her work before the Biden administration, insisting that as California’s attorney general, Ms Harris prosecuted cartels and drug-trafficking gangs - and as president would crack down on fentanyl and human trafficking. It remains to be seen if this new stance will be enough for her to cast off the “failed border tsar” label, given that Republicans will no doubt continue to hammer home that image all the way to election day."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewlle7jrgdo,'Squad' member Cori Bush loses congressional primary,Ms Bush was unseated in Missouri's first congressional district by St Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democratic congresswoman and ""Squad"" member Cori Bush has lost her primary race in Missouri, according to US media projections.  Wesley Bell, a St Louis prosecutor, will instead be the party's candidate in the state's first congressional district this November.  Ms Bush, a nurse, came to prominence as an organiser in the Black Lives Matter movement and, after taking office in 2021, as one of the Democratic members of the ""Squad"", who are known to support progressive causes.  She has been a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza, with pro-Israel groups spending more than $10m (£7.9m) on efforts to unseat her in the primary. Projections from both the Associated Press news agency and NBC News suggest Mr Bell is on track to win the vote with 51% of ballots cast, compared to Ms Bush's 46%.  The district is a strongly Democratic area and Mr Bell is expected to hold it in the November general election.  Almost all the money spent in campaigning against Ms Bush reportedly came from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Aipac is a pro-Israel lobbying group and has vowed to spend over $100m to unseat progressive lawmakers who have spoken out against the war in Gaza, Politico reported. In her concession speech, Ms Bush declared: ""All they did was radicalise me, so now they need to be afraid."" ""Aipac, I'm coming to tear your kingdom down,"" she added.  It marks the second loss for the Squad - a group of nine progressive Democrats in the US House of Representatives - during the 2024 election cycle.  In June, more than $15m was put into a successful bid to oust Jamaal Bowman, another critic of Israel, from his seat in New York. The figure was the most spent in any House primary in history. Mr Bowman was ousted just weeks after he was censured for pulling a fire alarm while the House was in session. Speaking to CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, ahead of the vote, Mr Bell accused Ms Bush of ""not doing her job"".  ""She is not working with others, and it's hurting our district."" Ms Bush defended her record to the outlet: ""My community knows who I am. They know that I am going to fight for the people in the streets."" Less than two weeks after the 7 October attacks, Ms Bush introduced a resolution calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid. The attacks, carried out by Hamas and other armed militant groups saw around 1,200 people killed in Israel and another 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. In response, Israel declared a ""complete siege"" on Gaza, cutting off supplies of electricity, food, fuel, and water. To date, more than 39,600 people have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Bush also boycotted a joint address to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July, calling him a war criminal and saying he was at the forefront of a genocide. Dozens of House and Senate Democrats boycotted Mr Netanyahu's address.  In a statement ahead of the vote Ms Bush accused Mr Netanyahu of perpetrating a ""genocide"" in Gaza and claimed Congress was ""actively celebrating"" his actions.  Ms Bush has also been investigated by the justice department, House ethics committee and Federal Elections Commission for her campaign spending, mostly over allegations that she improperly paid her husband, a security guard, for protection. She previously said any claims she had misused federal funds were ""simply false"". Three other US states - Kansas, Michigan and Washington - also held primary elections on Tuesday. Dan Newhouse, one of the last remaining Republicans to have voted to impeach Donald Trump, appeared to have scraped through in his primary election. Washington state holds what is known as a jungle primary, allowing the top two finishers - regardless of party - to advance to the general election. Mr Newhouse, an agricultural scientist who has represented a central Washington district since 2015, faced off against two Trump-endorsed candidates - Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler and ex-nurse Tiffany Smiley. Early projections of the race show Mr Sessler leading Mr Newhouse, with Ms Smiley close behind them - meaning that the incumbent could face a difficult challenge in November.  Of the so-called ""Impeachment 10"" - Republicans who voted in favour of Trump's impeachment - only Mr Newhouse and California's David Valadao remain in the House.  All other pro-impeachment Republicans have either left Congress since their 2021 vote or been defeated in primary races."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd73x77r22do,Corbyn in talks to form new independent MPs group,A new group could unlock hundreds of thousands of pounds of public funding and access.,9 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Jeremy Corbyn is in talks with four other independent MPs to form a new group, potentially boosting their influence in Parliament. Six independent MPs were elected at the 2024 general election - the most in modern history – including the former Labour leader. The potential grouping of five independents – who all campaigned on a pro-Palestinian platform - would equal the number of Reform UK MPs and outnumber the Greens. While nothing has been formalised, Shockat Adam - who unseated Labour's Jonathan Ashworth to become MP for Leicester South - told the BBC the group was ""looking at options that would give us more access to the levers of power"". Alex Easton, the former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in the Northern Ireland Assembly who was elected as independent MP for North Down, is not part of the discussions, the BBC understands.  Mr Corbyn and Mr Adam have been talking to fellow independents Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed to explore options on how they can impact policy more effectively. All five beat Labour candidates in July's election with their pro-Palestine stance in Labour-supporting constituencies with large Muslim populations. If the five independents became an official group in Parliament, they would increase their chances of taking part in debates and committees, which are usually decided proportional to party size. Established parties of five MPs have previously been eligible for as much as £129,000 in ""short money"" - public funds given to opposition parties to support research. However, Parliament's rules currently appear to prevent these funds going to new groups formed between general elections. But by collaborating the independents could secure more funds for their campaign work by sharing resources and hosting joint fundraisers. Given Labour's huge majority it is unclear how effective a force the independents will be in parliament. But the loose coalition has already worked together to try to influence policy and together with Green MPs tabled a series of amendments to the Kings Speech. One of their first actions was to reach out to the seven Labour MPs - all former allies of Mr Corbyn including his former shadow chancellor John McDonnell - who were suspended from the party for six months after voting in favour of a rebel amendment to scrap the two-child benefit. So far, there has been no formal coordination between independent MPs and suspended Labour MPs, the BBC understands. Mr Corbyn said: ""I was elected by my constituents to speak out against the genocide in Gaza, against child poverty and against the demonisation of migrants and refugees.  ""I am proud to work alongside my fellow independent colleagues to make sure our constituents’ voices are heard.  ""This country is demanding real change - and the more MPs who are prepared to stand up for international law, defend refugees and oppose the far-right, the better."" Mr Corbyn retained the Islington North seat he has represented for more than 40 years in July's general election, defeating the Labour candidate by 7,000 votes. Labour's ruling body blocked Mr Corbyn from standing as the party's candidate in March 2023. He had previously been suspended from Labour over his response to a report into antisemitism in the party during his time as leader. Mr Adam was part of one of the big shocks of election night when he won his seat by 979 votes from former Labour shadow minister Mr Ashworth, who had a majority of more than 20,000. The optometrist, who ran for office for the first time in 2024, said that whatever happens in the future he does not want to lose his independence as he believes many MPs have been ""hamstrung"" by parties. He said he ran as an independent to ""show you can do it without the political parties"" and that ""normal people can win an election"". Mr Adam is calling on parliament to improve the standing of independent MPs, as current rules favour larger parties in setting debates and senior committee roles. He predicts there will be more independent MPs in the future ""as more people are going to look at ways to be the representation and the change they want to see"". ""We will be a test case,"" Mr Adam said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmw77w1707o,Isaac Hayes' family threaten to sue Trump for $3m,"The late soul star's family demand $3m after Trump's ""unauthorised"" use of Hold On, I'm Coming.",12 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The family of the late soul singer Isaac Hayes has ordered Donald Trump to stop playing the star's song Hold On, I'm Coming at his campaign rallies. A letter sent to Trump and his team, and shared by Hayes' son on social media, threatens to sue the former US President if he does not comply by 16 August. The family is also demanding $3m (£2.4m) in licensing fees for the campaign's repeated use of the song between 2022 and 2024. The song, which was made famous by soul duo Sam and Dave, is a regular feature of Trump’s rallies, often playing before and after his speeches.  Hayes composed the song in 1966 with Dave Porter, when he was a staff writer at Stax Records. He went on to become a Grammy and Oscar-winner in his own right, with hits like Shaft and Walk On By. In their legal letter, Hayes' family claimed to have ""asked repeatedly"" for Trump to stop using the song. They go on to cite 134 occasions on which the campaign went ahead anyway. Their lawyer, James Walker, alleged that the Trump campaign has ""wilfully and brazenly engaged in copyright infringement”.  He went on to demand that the campaign remove any videos featuring the song, and issue a full statement acknowledging that Hayes' family have not ""authorised, endorsed or permitted"" the use of his music. Walker added that the requested $3m settlement is a ""heavily discounted"" figure, due to the frequency with which the campaign has played Hold On, I'm Coming.  The letter also stated that if a resolution was not made and a lawsuit was issued, the Hayes family would demand damages of $150,000 per use of the song - amounting to more than $20m (£15.7m). The Trump campaign has yet to respond to the letter or the threat of legal action. The Hayes family previously criticised Trump for playing Hold On, I'm Coming at a National Rifle Association convention, less than a week after the Uvalde school shooting in 2022, which claimed the lives of 19 people. ""Our condolences go out to the victims and families of Uvalde and mass shooting victims everywhere,"" they wrote at the time. Porter, the song’s co-writer, also wrote: ""I did not and would not approve of them using the song for any of his purposes."" Meanwhile, Sam Moore - who sang the original hit recording - objected to Barack Obama using the song in his 2008 presidential campaign. ""I have not agreed to endorse you for the highest office in our land,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""My vote is a very private matter between myself and the ballot box,"" he added.  On Sunday, Hayes' son, Isaac Hayes III, elaborated on his objections to the Trump campaign. ""Donald Trump epitomises a lack of integrity and class, not only through his continuous use of my father’s music without permission but also through his history of sexual abuse against women and his racist rhetoric,"" he wrote on Instagram.  ""This behaviour will no longer be tolerated, and we will take swift action to put an end to it."" The Hayes family are the latest in a long line of musicians to complain about the Trump campaign. The Beatles, Neil Young, Adele, Bruce Springsteen, Sinead O'Connor and Aerosmith are among the artists who have issued the politician with cease-and-desist orders. In fact, the list of artists who have protested is so lengthy that the topic has its own Wikipedia page. On Saturday, Celine Dion's team also protested against the use of her track My Heart Will Go On at a rally in Montana. ""In no way is this use authorised, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use,"" a statement read.  ""And really, THAT song?"", it added – alluding to the fact that the track was recorded for the film Titanic, about a sinking ship. However, musicians have only had limited success in stopping politicians from using their music. In the US, campaigns are required to obtain a Political Entities License from the music rights body BMI, which gives them access to more than 20 million tracks for use in their rallies. Artists and publishers can ask for their music to be withdrawn from the list, but it seems that organisers rarely check the database to ensure they have clearance. “They don’t care as much about artists’ rights as perhaps you’d want,” said Larry Iser, a lawyer who represented Jackson Browne when he sued Republican candidate John McCain for one of his songs in a 2008 commercial. (The case was later settled). ""It’s not just the Trump campaign,"" Iser told Billboard magazine. ""Most political campaigns aren’t keen about just taking the song down."" Cases rarely, if ever, head to court - with both sides typically backing down after a flurry of legal letters."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyjl912z7po,Why the 'weird' label is working for Kamala Harris,Some political experts say calling Trump “weird” effectively repackages President Biden’s “threat to democracy” theme with a light touch.,10 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"""They're weird.""  With that simple diss - as well as an overall more streamlined message - Vice-President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign has shifted the conversation away from the weaknesses of her boss, President Joe Biden, and shone a spotlight on her opponent, Donald Trump. The change of tone was on full display at rallies this week, where she appeared with her new vice-presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. With Beyonce's Freedom as their soundtrack, the pair made the case that they were out to protect American freedoms while their ""weird"" Republican opponents, Trump and his running mate JD Vance, threatened to take them away. ""We’re not going back,"" Ms Harris told an enthusiastic crowd in Philadelphia, leading a chorus of what has become the campaign's de-facto slogan. It is a stripped-back version of Mr Biden’s 2020 message - that Trump is a “threat to democracy” - that casts the former president as out of touch with American life.  Even the vice-president's press releases, sent from a campaign that once served Mr Biden, have reflected the tone shift from deeply serious to something more light-touch. Just five days after Mr Biden stepped aside, a Harris spokesperson quipped that a Trump speech made him sound “like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant”. Campaign strategists say this new messaging appears to be cutting through with Democrat-leaning voters because it makes voting for Ms Harris sound more like a common-sense choice, and less like a civic chore. But it is too early to tell if this fresh goodwill for a vice-president who, until recently, struggled to grab the attention of American voters will last until November's election day. California Lieutenant Gov Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat who considers the vice-president a close friend, said the campaign’s fresh rhetoric reflects Ms Harris’s “great sense of humour” and her ability to be “a good communicator on a very basic level”. “The fact is, these things are proving to be her strengths, and her joyfulness is breaking through the dark, menacing undertones of Donald Trump and his running mate.” Meanwhile, Trump, who has long been known as an effective mudslinger and energetic campaigner since he entered politics during the 2016 presidential campaign, has struggled to punch back - especially against the “weird” framing. “They’re the weird ones. Nobody’s ever called me weird. I’m a lot of things, but weird I’m not,” Trump said last week in an interview with conservative radio host Clay Travis. He returned to the theme at a rally on Friday in Montana, telling the crowd: ""We’re very solid people. We want to have strong borders, we want to have good elections, we want low interest rates, we want to be able to buy a house."" ""I think we’re the opposite of weird, they’re weird.""  Ms Harris, who once trailed Trump, is now on the front foot, polls suggest. David Polyansky, who served as deputy campaign manager for Florida's Republican  Governor Ron DeSantis’s 2024 presidential campaign, said that this shift could be because Ms Harris was beating Trump at his own game. Since he first ran for president, Trump has benefited from being the main political story in the country, enjoying what political insiders like to call “earned media”, or free press. But it is Ms Harris’s dramatic swing to the top of the Democratic ticket just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that has dominated headlines and airwaves in recent weeks - and she has done it without sitting down for a major media interview. To upstage the former president, who only recently faced an assassination attempt, is no small feat, said Mr Polyansky. “It’s really pretty remarkable,” he said. Her campaign appears further buoyed by picking Mr Walz as her running mate. A survey conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from 5 to 9 August puts Ms Harris ahead of Trump by 50% to 46% in three key battleground states - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. It comes after a recent YouGov poll, conducted on 4-6 August, which suggested she would win the popular vote, with 45% of respondents saying they would vote for her in November, compared to 43% for Trump. That is a reversal of fortunes. A similar poll by YouGov, conducted almost three weeks ago, showed her losing by three points. It was, in fact, Mr Walz who was the first to use the “weird” label when making media appearances last month in support of Ms Harris’s fledgling candidacy. He was quick to use it again at that Philadelphia rally with Ms Harris when speaking of their Republican opponents: “These guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell.” Mr Walz’s folksy ways seemed to resonate with several voters who spoke to the BBC. They said they liked the Minnesota governor because he was plainspoken. Between drags of a cigarette, Tyler Engel - an independent Ohio voter on vacation in St Augustine, Florida - said that Mr Walz “seems like a normal guy, a family man”. “And if there is one thing that we are starved for in this country, it’s normal people,” Mr Engel added. Another voter, John Patterson of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, said he found Mr Walz to be “a very genuine person”. “What you see is what you get with him,” he added. Some political consultants marvelled at the “weird” label’s effectiveness. Many said that it broke through because it felt authentic, was not an audience-tested catchphrase or cliche, and it came about “fast and organically”. Calling Trump and JD Vance “weird” effectively repackaged President Biden’s “threat to democracy” theme in a “very understandable - almost light-hearted - way that was maybe less severe and more colloquial”, said Brian Brokaw, who worked on several of Ms Harris’ campaigns and ran a Super PAC that supported her presidential campaign in 2020. He said the term immediately helped to recast the race from a referendum on Mr Biden’s four years in office to a question of “do we really want to go back to what we were doing during the Trump era?” Republican pollster Frank Luntz was more sceptical.  On BBC Newsnight on Tuesday, he declared Ms Harris the new front runner, noting she had captured fresh ""momentum"". But he dismissed the ""weird"" label as ""weird in itself"", saying it didn't resonate with voters. The catchphrase did seem to land with several undecided voters interviewed by the BBC. Jacob Fisher, an independent voter from Atlanta, said he thought calling Trump and Mr Vance “weird” was appropriate and only mildly insulting in an age of political name-calling. “I think it’s fair,” Mr Fisher said. “You can’t say that it’s very harsh because you have the other guy talking about how his opponents are vermin. So ‘weird’? I don’t know, but you can’t really complain if you’re Donald Trump.” Still, voters who said they were backing Trump were unimpressed with the campaign’s recent messaging. Frank and Theresa Walker of Illinois shared the view that the US was “going to hell” under the Biden-Harris administration, and Gem Lowery - a Trump voter in Florida - said she did not like Harris’s pick for vice-president or the “weird” label they have used when discussing Trump, Mr Vance and the Republican platform. “I think the Democrats are the weird ones,” Lowery told the BBC. “So no, I don’t think that’s right to call Republicans ‘weird.’” Ms Harris’s “brat summer” will not last forever. While the pick of Mr Walz and the upcoming Democratic National Convention will be certain to maintain Ms Harris’s media dominance, experts agree that the campaign will have to change gears soon. Mr Brokaw, a long-time adviser to Ms Harris, said that her campaign will need to work to bottle the enthusiasm it has enjoyed since the vice-president became the Democratic nominee. “The peak of the honeymoon period is the convention, and then it's going to be a grind for two months probably with some debates,” Mr Brokaw said. “This is an exciting period of time, but at a certain point it’s going to come back to reality and then it’s go time.” “If we’re still talking about Trump and Vance being weird in October, I think I’d be surprised,” he added. David Polyansky, the Republican strategist, said the label “works well from a 60,000 foot view”, but he believed a message on the economy and immigration would ultimately sway voters in November. “So for Trump, it’s key he doesn’t take the bait, he focuses on his message and he reminds folks of his record and the administration’s failures on both of those issues.” Additional reporting from Mike Wendling and Rachel Looker"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c985enjgdy9o,Trump doubles down on scary helicopter trip story,"Trump says he shared the ride with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown who told him ""terrible things"" about Kamala Harris.",11 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Donald Trump continues to insist that he once took a scary helicopter trip with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, even as Mr Brown dismissed the story as ""fiction"". But it turns out another California politician, Nate Holden, did accompany Trump  decades ago on a turbulent chopper ride, US media report. Both Mr Brown and Mr Holden are black.  The former president said during a news conference  that he and Mr Brown had gone ""down"" in a helicopter together and Mr Brown had been ""a little concerned"". The story  became an issue after Trump recounted it on Thursday, in response to a question about Mr Brown's relationship with Kamala Harris. The pair dated in the 1990s. Trump was asked whether he thought the relationship had played a role in Ms Harris's career journey. At the time, Ms Harris was a prosecutor and in 2002 was elected district attorney in San Francisco. ""Well, I know Willie Brown very well,"" Trump said, before speaking about his memories of the flight. ""We thought maybe this was the end,"" Trump said. ""We were in a helicopter... and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing."" He then claimed the former mayor had told him ""terrible things"" about Ms Harris.  ""He had a big part in what happened with Kamala,"" Trump said.  Mr Brown, 90, told US media he had never shared a helicopter with Trump, adding: ""I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him.""  He also denied he said anything disparaging about Ms Harris. ""That's so far-fetched, it's unbelievable,"" he told local TV station KRON. ""I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way.  ""She's a good friend a long time ago, absolutely beautiful woman, smart as all hell, very successful, electorally speaking. ""He was doing what Donald does best, his creative fiction.""  Despite a flat denial from the former San Francisco mayor, Trump insisted the story was true in a call to the New York Times, saying he was “probably going to sue” without elaborating. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung posted a photo of a page of Trump's book ""Letters to Trump"" showing the former president pictured with Mr Brown and including a caption mentioning the helicopter incident. Meanwhile Mr Holden, 95, a former Los Angeles city councilman and state senator, told US media outlets he had a distinct recollection of a helicopter trip with Trump. In the 1990s, Trump was attempting to develop property in Los Angeles. Mr Holden said that they took a very turbulent helicopter ride around 1990, during a visit with Trump to his Atlantic City casino.  The helicopter experienced mechanical trouble and was forced to make an emergency landing in New Jersey. Others speculated that Trump, 78, may have confused Willie Brown with Jerry Brown, California's former governor, with whom he shared a helicopter in 2018 to visit the aftermath of the Paradise wildfires. Gavin Newsom, the current state governor, was also on the flight. But both men told US media there had been no emergency landing or danger on that flight. Trump's remarks at an hour-long news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate come as recent polls show him slipping against Ms Harris.  A survey conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from 5 to 9 August puts Ms Harris ahead of Trump by 50% to 46% in three key battleground states - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The RealClearPolitics polling average gives Ms Harris a slight edge in the popular vote, although Mr Trump retains a lead in a number of the most important swing states."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9dnnypx04o,New bodycam footage shows moments before Trump rally shooting,The footage paints a clearer picture of the law enforcement response in the moments before and after the shooting.,9 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Newly released footage from local Pennsylvania police reveals a clearer picture of the moments surrounding the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July.   In one body-camera video, a local officer tells colleagues he told the US Secret Service ahead of time to secure the building the gunman used.  Another shows the moment an officer is hoisted on to a rooftop and lays eyes on the gunman, seconds before he opens fire at the Trump rally.  Trump was nicked by a bullet in the shooting, one person was killed and two others badly injured.  The body and dashboard footage was released on Thursday to US media outlets by the Butler Township Police Department.  They capture moments of frustration, confusion and miscommunication in the moments before and after the assassination attempt.  In one, a local officer said he had asked the Secret Service to man the building where the gunman had fired from, days before the rally.  “I told them they need to post guys over there,"" he said, according to one video obtained by the Wall Street Journal. ""I told them that [on] Tuesday.""  The open-air rally took place on Saturday 13 July. The officer appears angry as he tells his colleagues that he asked the Secret Service to secure the building. “I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, ‘Yeah, no problem, we’re going to post guys over here,’” the officer says. Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot and killed by the Secret Service counter-sniper team after he fired eight bullets in Trump’s direction from a rooftop just outside the rally's security perimeter. The would-be assassin was on a building in what police have described as a ""secondary ring"", which was patrolled not by the Secret Service but by local and state officers. Trump, who was on stage addressing supporters, was wounded in the ear before he ducked and Secret Service agents pulled him off stage.  In another video, a Butler County police officer is seen being hoisted up by a colleague on to the rooftop where he spots Crooks.  He quickly drops down when he sees the gunman is armed. He is then seen running to the other side of the building and to his police car to retrieve a rifle. Around 40 seconds after the officer first lays eyes on the gunman, Crooks fires at Trump. The officer shouts to his colleague: ""He's straight up ... Who's got eyes on him?"" The video then shows police officers trying to access the roof. “He’s got glasses, long hair,” the officer who saw Crooks tells them, adding he has a book bag and an AR-style rifle.  After getting on the roof, the officers see Crooks’ body.  The first police officer is then heard saying: ""I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself,"" adding that he ""started calling out"" that a gunman was on the roof. ""Were you on the same frequency?"" he is heard asking, referring to the police radio. In other footage, one officer reportedly appears confused as to why the rooftop was unmanned. ""I thought it was you! I thought you guys were on the roof!"" He then swears in frustration and asked: ""Why are we not on the roof?""   The state police had posted three counter-snipers inside one of the adjacent buildings.  One of them had spotted Crooks earlier in the day following reports among the law enforcement on site of a suspicious person at the rally. The state police sniper then took a photo of Crooks before leaving his post to search for the suspect. BBC News has not seen all the videos. Their contents were reported on by multiple US news outlet.  In a statement on Thursday, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency was reviewing the footage. ""The US Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,"" he said.  ""The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a US Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again."" The FBI is also investigating the incident, as is a bipartisan House panel made up of 13 lawmakers."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9znr5vne2o,FBI probes claims Iran hacked Trump campaign,The FBI confirmed it is investigating Trump's claims his campaign was hacked by Iranian agents.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA," The FBI has opened an investigation into allegations from the Trump campaign that it was targeted by hackers working for the Iranian government. “We can confirm the FBI is investigating the matter,” the agency said in a short statement on Monday without specifically naming the former president or Iran. A Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by ""foreign sources hostile to the United States"". Iranian officials have denied any connection to the hack and the US government has not formally accused Iran. The FBI is also looking into whether Iranian hackers targeted the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign, according to CBS News, the BBC's news partner, citing people familiar with the investigation. The Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June. Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear- phishing email – a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link. On Saturday, Trump said the hackers were ""only able to get publicly available information"". The FBI began the investigations in early summer after both campaigns experienced attempted phishing schemes, CBS News reported. According to the Washington Post, three staff members of the Biden-Harris campaign were also targeted by phishing emails in the days before President Joe Biden announced that he was quitting the race.  A Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement to the media that the campaign ""vigilantly monitors and protects against cyberthreats, and we are not aware of any security breaches of our systems"". The BBC has asked the Harris campaign for comment. According to the Washington Post, the FBI probe into the hacking attempts was first opened in June.  Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff was among several lawmakers calling for the FBI to reveal what it knows about the hacking attempts.  He said that the US intelligence community “moved much too slow to properly identity the hacking and dumping scheme carried out by Russia” in 2016 and “should act quickly here”. It comes after Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell said he was requesting a briefing from the Department of Homeland Security on the ""alleged hack of Trump's presidential campaign"".  ""Yes, Trump is the most despicable person ever to seek office. He also sought foreign hacking in a past election... But that doesn’t mean America ever tolerates foreign interference,"" he posted on X/Twitter on Saturday. At campaign rallies in 2016, he asked Russia to hack his opponent in the race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. US security sources had previously warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month’s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania.  And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg798l439ydo,Harris rejects claims she would support Israel arms embargo,The news comes after Ms Harris was heckled at a rally in Michigan by pro-Palestinian protestors.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Kamala Harris will not support an arms embargo on Israel, her national security adviser says, a day after the presidential candidate was heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters at a rally in Detroit. In a post on Twitter/X, Biden administration official Phil Gordon said Ms Harris ""has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups"". The statement came after leaders of the Uncommitted movement - which has urged Democrats to boycott the election over US support for Israel - said Ms Harris had ""expressed an openness"" to meeting with them to discuss an arms embargo.  Mr Gordon seemed to dispute that report. He added that Ms Harris ""will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law"". His statement comes as tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate. Iran has threatened to ""punish"" Israel after the assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Israel has not claimed responsibility.  The US has accelerated its weapon supplies to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attacks. Both Mr Biden and Ms Harris have called for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid in Gaza.  Since Mr Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his second in command, leaders of the Uncommitted movement have been pressing Ms Harris to halt US military support for Israel.  Ms Harris's rally on Wednesday took place in a swing state that is home to the largest Arab-American community in the US.  Leaders of the Uncommitted movement said in a statement that they had a chance to speak to the vice-president before the rally and told her that the US needed an arms embargo. ""We want to support you, Vice-President Harris, and our voters need to see you turn a new page on Gaza policy that includes embracing an arms embargo,"" Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of Uncommitted, said he told the Democratic nominee.  Afterwards, a number of pro-Palestinian protestors gathered at the rally and interrupted Ms Harris's speech, chanting: ""Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won’t vote for genocide"". Ms Harris responded by telling the crowd: ""Everyone's voice matters.""  But as the protestors continued to chant, she stopped again and said: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” Both JD Vance, Trump's running mate, and Ms Harris have made a number campaign stops in the Midwest this week as they try to woo voters in critical swing states.  The latest poll, from Marquette University Law School, shows Ms Harris is leading Trump 53% to 47% among likely voters, a big bump from when Mr Biden was still in the race and was trailing Trump nationally and in several battleground states.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77l472rym0o,Hayatou - the man who transformed African football,"Issa Hayatou, who has died aged 77, defended African football interests over almost three decades in high office, but was also caught up in scandal.",10 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Issa Hayatou served as president of the Confederation of African Football from 1988 to 2017 When it comes to writing the history of the Confederation of African Football, the figure of Issa Hayatou will loom large. Following his death on Thursday, the Cameroonian has been hailed as a steadfast and pan-African leader, and one who strongly defended the continentâs interests over the course of his 29-year reign as Caf president. He also held high office in world governing body Fifa, including a brief spell as its acting president, and was a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Hayatou died aged 77 in Paris, where he had spent much time receiving dialysis for kidney problems. His time at Caf was littered with historical firsts as well as controversy, but one constant was the iron first with which he ruled. The son of a local ruler from Garoua, in younger days Hayatou became a national track champion over 400m and 800m and also represented Cameroon in basketball at the All Africa Games. In 1974, aged 28, he took his first posts in sports administration when he became secretary general of Cameroonâs football federation (Fecafoot). Just over a decade later he graduated to president of Fecafoot. By 1986 he was elected onto Cafâs executive committee, was head of the continental body within two years and a Fifa vice-president within five. But for a man who dominated African football for so long â revolutionising it in many areas â Hayatou only won his first Caf presidential election by the skin of his teeth. His victory, by four votes, ushered in a new era. Hayatou pledged to increase competitions, revenue, credibility and relations with Fifa and other confederations, and delivered on many of his promises. ""President Hayatou was always able, through his leadership, his interpersonal skills, and his sense of pragmatism, to defend the voice of Africa. We owe him a lot,"" Fecafoot's current president Samuel Etoâo said. Africa hosted the Fifa World Cup for the first time during Hayatou's spell as Caf boss - although then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter (left) was the driving force behind the move Hayatou was incredibly conscious of Caf having enough money to run its projects and transformed the organisation's balance sheet. Having inherited just $1.25m (Â£1m) in the bank, Caf was $130m (Â£102m) in the black when he left office in 2017. When it came to matters on the field, former Caf secretary general Hicham El Amrani said Hayatou provided more competition ""to allow for both infrastructure and player development"". Womenâs, Under-17 and Under-20 versions of the Africa Cup of Nations were introduced. With the number of European-based players ever increasing at the Nations Cup, which he expanded from eight to 16 teams, Hayatou created the African Nations Championship to give domestic-based footballers a chance to shine. Hayatou was also fervent in his belief that the Nations Cup finals should remain in a January-February slot, amid outcry from European clubs. Hayatou also increased African representation at the World Cup from just two teams in 1990 to five guaranteed participants - the second-best representation after Europe - when the tournament expanded in 1998. Hayatou was also incredibly proud about the World Cup coming to Africa for the first time when South Africa hosted in 2010 - even if Fifa president Sepp Blatter was the driving force in that development. Hayatou became Fifa's acting president in 2015 when the Zurich-based body was hit by scandal Over the course of almost three decades at the top it was perhaps inevitable that Hayatou would be implicated in scandals. Perhaps the biggest stain on his reputation was when he was caught up in the scandal surrounding ISL (International Sport and Leisure), the firm awarded lucrative World Cup broadcasting rights but then collapsed in 2001. Paperwork found by the BBC showed that Hayatou had received a sum totalling nearly $20,000 (Â£15,700) in 1995. He denied any wrongdoing and said the payment was a gift for Caf. At the time, it was not a criminal offence to receive such money. Fifa took no action against Hayatou but the IOC acted differently, reprimanding the Cameroonian for his actions - saying they constituted a conflict of interest. Arguably more serious was the allegation from a whistle-blower that Hayatou, along with a fellow Caf official, had accepted $1.5m (Â£1.18m) in bribes from Qatar in 2010 to secure support for its ultimately successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. Once again, the Cameroonian denied the charges, with no action ever taken against him. The signing of a deal worth $1bn (Â£780m) with French media rights company Lagardere in 2015 - one of Hayatou's last major acts as Caf president â also proved controversial. In August 2021 Hayatou was handed a one-year ban by Fifa for breaching its code of ethics, nominally for putting pen to paper without the full approval of Caf's executive committee. The sanction was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which found no justification for Fifa's actions. An attack on Togo's delegation on the eve of the 2010 Nations Cup led to an increased security presence in host nation Angola How Hayatou and Caf reacted to tragedy in 2010, when two members of Togo's delegation were shot dead by militants on the eve of the Nations Cup finals in Angola, did cause outrage. After withdrawing from the competition, Caf chose to ban the West Africans from the next two editions of the tournament. It may have been technically within the organisation's rules, but the decision showed neither appreciation for force majeure nor basic common decency. Togo were eventually reinstated. Yet, on another level, Caf's unpublicised actions showed considerable insight into Hayatou's thinking as a leader. I was astonished to learn Caf had responded with incredible speed once it had received news of the incident, scrambling helicopters and other support vehicles to the site to help those injured. When I asked why Caf had chosen not to announce this Hayatou simply said: ""Why should we need to publicise what we have done?"" In truth, this was a direct response to his upbringing as the son of a sultan in northern Cameroon. The rulerâs words and decisions were final, with no explanation required. The deadly ambush that targeted Adebayor & Togo Fifa president Gianni Infantini (left) gave his backing to Hayatou's opponent in Caf's presidential election in 2017 After an unsuccessful bid to become Fifa president in 2002, the beginning of the end of Hayatou's Caf reign came in 2016 when elections to replace Blatter were held by Fifa. The Cameroonian instructed Caf's 54 members to back Bahraini candidate Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, yet Gianni Infantino assumed the crown instead. The Swiss-Italian was keen to see Hayatou removed from power and he was dethroned by the Fifa-backed candidate Ahmad in 2017. However, the Malagasy became far more enmeshed in scandal than his predecessor ever had been â becoming the first Caf president to be banned by Fifa for breaching its ethics code. Developments since Hayatouâs exit have given some of those who had sought to vote him out of office time to reflect on his legacy. ""The passing of Issa serves as a poignant reminder of the loss we have experienced since his exit from the realm of power in African football,"" Musa Bility, the former president of the Liberian federation, told BBC Sport Africa. ""Each of us who opposed him should find the strength to apologise to this remarkable leader."" On the very day that Hayatouâs one-year Fifa ban was overturned, during the staging of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in his homeland, he caught sight of Infantino. Hayatou reportedly told him 'you wanted me dead, but I am alive'. The Cameroonian has now departed, with tributes pouring in and flags lowered to half-mast by Caf and the IOC. Despite his faults, many believe he promoted the interests of African football better than most who went before or have followed since. Hayatou was the son of a local ruler from Garoua, northern Cameroon"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54l4x7d71o,Showdown is set: Trump and Harris plan to debate in September,The ABC News debate will be the first time the rivals square off since Ms Harris became the Democrats' nominee.,9 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"ABC News has said it will host the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on 10 September.  The network confirmed the showdown in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after Trump said on Thursday that he would be open to debating his Democratic rival multiple times before the November election.  “We think we should do three debates,” Trump said, suggesting two additional debates that he said would be hosted by Fox News and NBC, respectively.  Ms Harris confirmed that she will attend the ABC debate while at an event in Michigan on Thursday, and said later that she would be open to additional debates. The network said the debate will be moderated by World News Tonight anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis.  “I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10. I hear he’s finally committed to it and I’m looking forward to it,"" Ms Harris said at the event in Detroit.  Mr Trump, the Republican candidate, debated President Joe Biden once in June.  The two were slated to do so again on 10 September but Mr Biden withdrew from the presidential race after a disastrous performance against Trump in the televised matchup. That paved the way for Ms Harris to become the Democratic nominee.  The confirmation of the debate on ABC marks an end to a back-and-forth that followed Mr Biden's decision to leave the race between the Trump and Harris campaigns over that planned showdown. Trump had previously said that he wanted a debate hosted by the conservative network Fox News, saying it would take place in Pennsylvania, ""at a site in an area to be determined"".  The Harris campaign had maintained they would still like to debate Trump on 10 September. At a news conference on Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump also said he would like to debate Ms Harris two additional times - on 4 September on Fox News and on 25 September on NBC.  Trump said that CBS will host a debate between the two vice-presidential nominees, Republican JD Vance and Democratic Tim Walz. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate this autumn, the New York Times reported. Fox News said it sent formal letters to both campaigns last month proposing a September debate in Pennsylvania, though the Harris campaign said on Thursday that ""Trump has to show up"" to the ABC debate before they confirm any further showdowns.  Trump also criticised Ms Harris for not taking reporter questions or doing an interview since she became the likely Democratic nominee just over two weeks ago.  He called her “barely competent” and criticised her intelligence. Later on Thursday, Ms Harris told reporters that she has asked her team to ""get an interview scheduled"" before the end of the month.  Trump's hour-long event was held amid reports that his campaign is feeling the pressure from Democrats, who have new enthusiasm under Ms Harris and have been dominating headlines.  National and battleground state polls suggest her campaign has gained ground in recent days, though the race for the White House remains a close contest. The former president denied he had ""recalibrated"" his campaign to challenge Ms Harris instead of Mr Biden, and he appeared to prickle when asked about the audience Ms Harris draws at rallies. ""Oh, give me a break,"" he said, arguing that crowds at his rallies were larger than at hers. His Thursday news conference is the first he has held in several months, as his campaign has previously focused on holding rallies across the country.  Trump also praised his running mate Mr Vance, who was recently under fire for comments he made in 2021 when he said those without children shouldn't be leading the country and that women who don't have children are ""miserable"" and ""childless cat ladies"".  “I have to tell you, JD Vance has really stepped up,” Trump said. “He's doing a fantastic job.” He took aim at Ms Harris' track record on immigration and the economy.  He said that 20 million people had come over the US's southern border with Mexico, possibly many more, during the Biden-Harris administration. Since Mr Biden took office, the US Customs and Border Protection agency says almost 10.1 million crossings have been recorded.  While this is a significant increase on Mr Trump's time in power and the highest figure recorded under any US administration, the 20 million figure does not seem probable. The former president also said his tax cuts were ""the biggest in history"". But according to analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they were the eighth-largest since 1918 measured as a percentage of the size of the economy (GDP), and the fourth-largest in dollar terms since 1940 adjusted for inflation.   Although Trump didn't introduce the largest tax cut overall, he did pass the largest corporate tax cut in US history. He repeated his belief that US presidents should have a say over interest rates and monetary policy - a departure from the longstanding practice of having the US Federal Reserve, an independent body, oversee these matters. He emphasised his priorities of lowering inflation, lowering crime rates and strengthening the military. And he criticised the administration's transport policy, saying people would be ""forced"" to buy electric cars. However, the Biden administration has made it clear there are no plans for a ban on the sale of petrol vehicles. Ms Harris on Thursday addressed United Auto Workers in Detroit, and thanked the union for endorsing her.  She said there are ""89 days to get this done"" ahead of the election.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5rr0rgg3lo,"He's the new VP pick. To his students, he's Mr Walz","Kamala Harris' running mate taught high school, and those he taught say he was ""a gifted educator"".",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz could be America's next vice-president. Nobody is more enthusiastic about it than former students in his small-town, midwest classroom. At Mankato West High School, years before he joined the political scene, a young Mr Walz taught geography and social studies, supervised the lunchroom and coached the football team. The Harris campaign has sought to highlight Mr Walz's career as a teacher, even though he served six terms in Congress before he returned to Minnesota to run for governor, a position he's held since 2018.  Those who knew him back then told the BBC that his teaching history is a guide to the politician he has become and the vice-president he could be.  It was 1999 and Jacob Reitan - the first openly gay student at Mankato West - was part of an effort to form the first gay-straight alliance at the school. GSAs, student-run organisations focused on supporting LGBTQ youth, emerged across the country through the nineties. Mr Reitan still remembers the bullying he faced back then, from the homophobic insult spray-painted on his driveway to a smashed-in car window in the school parking lot. But he told the BBC the Walzes promoted inclusion, kindness and ""jointly made the school a place where it was safe to come out"". And because the new GSA required a faculty advisor, Coach Walz stepped up. ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" he said in a 2018 interview, explaining why he took the role. Mr Walz remained a firm supporter of same-sex rights and, in 2011, Mr Reitan stood by the then-congressman's side as President Barack Obama signed his bill repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for gay and lesbian Americans serving in the military into law. ""He's so perfect as an addition to the Harris ticket,"" Mr Reitan said. Introducing him on Tuesday at their first joint campaign event, Ms Harris lavished more praise on Coach Walz than on Governor Walz, his current title. ""Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having, and that every kid deserves,"" she said. ""He's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice-president he will be."" The Trump campaign has assailed Mr Walz as ""a dangerously liberal extremist"" who, along with Ms Harris, forms a ticket that they say is too far left for most Americans to stomach. They have scrutinised his record as Minnesota's governor - from enacting an ambitious left-wing agenda to delaying deployment of the National Guard in response to violent protests following the murder of George Floyd. The Harris campaign is leaning into a biography they believe can win over the rural and working-class voters she needs to defeat Mr Trump this November. While Ms Harris grew up and built her career in liberal California, Mr Walz spent his childhood fishing, farming and hunting in rural Nebraska and came to politics later in life. He joined the National Guard at age 17. For about 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he worked in public high schools - first for a year in China, then in Nebraska and later in his wife's native Minnesota. And former students like Mr Reitan are glowing in their praise for the ex-educator. For brothers Jake and Josh Jagdfeld, attending Mankato West was akin to ""home-schooling with the Walzes"". Josh Jagdfeld took classes with both Tim and Gwen Walz in the 10th grade, and he remembers worrying politics would change his favourite teacher. But when they met on Monday night, Mr Walz greeted him with a shout of ""Mankato West in the building!"" and a big hug. ""He's warm, engaging, cares about everybody he talks to. That's exactly the same Tim Walz I knew,"" Josh Jagdfeld told the BBC. Coach Walz, a defensive coordinator for the school's football team, tapped Jake Jagdfeld as line-backer, putting him ""in a position to succeed"". When Coach Walz joined the team, Mankato West was reeling from a winless 0-27 season. Three years later, it won its first ever state championship. ""Great credit goes to him,"" Jake Jagdfeld said. ""He helped to create an inspirational environment for us young men to feel confident and work hard."" In 2004, Noah Hobbs was in Mr Walz's last geography class before he left teaching. ""He's a very high-energy person, whether school was just starting or it was the end of the day, and that energy was infectious,"" he said. ""The level of care that he gave to all students - not just the kids getting 4.0 [GPAs] - was really impactful for me as a young kid."" Mr Hobbs believes the US is ""looking for someone that is authentic, and Tim embodies that in a way not seen in politics at that level very often"". Mr Walz's evolution from teacher to politician has been described as accidental. In his telling, it stemmed from an incident at then-President George W Bush's 2004 campaign rally in Mankato. He and another teacher chaperoned two students to the event but local organisers refused to let them in. ""They knew we were Democrats,"" Matt Klaber, one of the students, told the BBC. ""At this time, the Bush campaign was turning away any possible protesters from their rallies and this was no exception."" When Mr Klaber pulled out his ID, the staffers observed a faded John Kerry sticker on his wallet. The students were sent home. Mr Walz has described being ""struck by how deeply divided our country was becoming"". He went on to volunteer for the Kerry campaign, develop his own local contacts and then launched a bid for Congress in 2006. ""The news reports say part of what Kamala was looking for was chemistry and a governing partner,"" said Mr Klaber. ""Then picking Mr Walz was a no-brainer. All the good things people have been saying about him as a person are absolutely true."" When Mr Walz arrived on Capitol Hill, new members of Congress were learning in orientation sessions about their salary and benefits. ""They were talking about, ‘I know most of you are taking pay cuts,’” he told local Minnesota television station KSTP. “And I leaned to my aide and said, ‘This is four times what I’ve ever made in my life.’"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy76dkd74mro,Trump fights for spotlight as Democrats dominate coverage,"A shake up for the Democrats has led to an attention deficit for Trump - an unusual position for the ex-president, writes the BBC's Katty Kay.",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"On Thursday, Donald Trump walked into a room of journalists gathered at his Mar-a-Lago estate for a news conference. He didn’t look particularly happy. His remarks came after a week in which Kamala Harris and her new running mate Tim Walz have dominated media attention, raked in millions of dollars and enjoyed a bump in polling. Trump's media event seemed more an attempt to win back the spotlight than announce anything new. Just before Trump stepped up to the podium, one of his advisors texted me the wry assessment that Donald Trump is ""never boring!!"" (the exclamation marks were his). The event included a couple of news items. Trump announced that he'd agreed to join a TV debate with Vice-President Harris on 10 September. ABC News, the debate host, confirmed that Ms Harris had agreed to participate as well.  Trump also said he'd like to do two more debates. There's no word from the Harris team yet on whether they’ve accepted those additional matchups. Over the course of the hour-long event, Trump took dozens of questions and he chastised Ms Harris for failing to take questions from reporters since ascending to the top of the ticket. Much of the event, though, was spent on Trump's old favourites, as if he was reaching for his rally hits. He talked about poll numbers, the unfair media, the dire state of the country and, yes, crowd sizes (even comparing his crowds to those of the civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King, Jr) Historically, one way Trump gets attention is by saying things that are controversial. And there was some of that today, too. He suggested America was on the brink of a world war and said Jewish Americans who support Vice-President Harris need ""to have your head examined"". This attention deficit is an unusual position for Trump. The former president is not used to having to fight for the limelight, particularly in this election cycle. The Biden campaign was happy to let Trump dominate the news, in the belief that the more the race was about the former president, the better it would be for the current one. The Biden team wanted Trump front and centre. But the shake up on the Democratic side has been dramatic and newsworthy and has pushed Trump off the front pages. To make things harder for the Republican candidate, much of the coverage of Ms Harris's unexpected roll out as Democratic candidate has been positive. So, the strategy by Democrats has flipped. Right now, Democrats are enjoying the media attention. Ms Harris wants this race to be about her. And with all the Democratic political drama, the press has been happy to oblige. Hence the Mar-a-Lago news conference that didn't really have much news. Trump may do better following the advice of Marc Lotter, the Republican strategist who ran communication strategy for his 2020 campaign, who texted me to say the way the former president should win back attention was to stay focused.  ""Define Harris and Walz on policy,"" he said. ""He wins on policy and results."" To be fair, there was some of that in this press event. Trump repeatedly described Ms Harris as ""extreme"" and ""liberal"". He did tout his own record on the economy and the border.  But the attacks got rather lost in his grievance about crowd sizes and how they are reported, and even suggested that there may be something unconstitutional about the Harris campaign. And, then it was over. And, as if to prove a point, within minutes of Trump walking off stage, the fickle cable news cameras had shifted their lenses from Florida to  Michigan where Ms Harris and Mr Walz were holding a meeting with union workers. It was the Democrats time for some press coverage. Once again. North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze5gzr97ewo,Fact-checking claims about Tim Walz’s military record,Walz's military record has been under scrutiny after a series of claims made by veterans and leading Republicans.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was announced as Kamala Harris's running mate. Walz's Republican critics accused him of intentionally avoiding combat in Iraq by resigning from the National Guard months before his unit was deployed there. In August, the Harris campaign separately acknowledged that Walz had ""misspoke"" in 2018 when he said he carried assault weapons ""in war"".  We’ve looked into Walz's record. Minnesota Governor Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, a military force that is usually deployed within the US to respond to events such as natural disasters, but is also part of the US Army reserve. In August, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance accused Walz of ""stolen valour"". Vance referred to a video promoted by the Harris campaign which featured a comment made by Walz in 2018, while he was advocating for gun control. In the clip, Walz said he had ""carried weapons in war"".  This was not true. Walz went to Italy with the National Guard in 2003 as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan but he was never deployed to an active war zone. On 9 August, the Harris campaign issued a statement saying that “in making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke”. In August Vance claimed: “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.” Several former National Guard colleagues have previously publicly voiced frustrations at Walz’s decision to leave their unit before deployment to Iraq but others have rejected assertions that he retired to avoid combat duty. In February 2005, while he was still in the National Guard, Walz filed an application to run for election as a member of Congress from Minnesota. The following month it was announced that there would be “a possible partial mobilisation of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard” to Iraq within the next two years, according to a 2005 press release from Walz’s congressional campaign. In the statement, Walz said: “I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilisation.” He added: “I don’t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race."" Walz retired from the National Guard in May 2005, which he later said was so he could focus fully on running for Congress. His National Guard unit received orders to mobilise for Iraq in July 2005, and was sent there in March 2006, according to the battalion’s history page. On 13 August 2024, Mr Walz responded directly to his critics, recalling that he'd joined the National Guard aged 17: ""I served for the next 24 years for the same reason all my brothers and sisters do, we love this country. Then in 2005 I felt the call of duty again, this time giving service to my country in the halls of Congress."" The Trump campaign has accused Walz of lying about having retired as a command sergeant major. His official biography on the Minnesota state website says: “Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.” He did reach the rank of command sergeant major near the end of his service, but he would have had to serve in that role for three years to retire at that rank officially, says the National Guard. Personnel files show Walz was reduced one rank - to master sergeant - after retiring for benefits purposes. Vance served for four years in the US Marine Corps. He was deployed to Iraq for about six months in 2005 as a military journalist, although he didn't experience combat.  “I was lucky to escape any real fighting,” he said in his 2016 memoir.  He left the Marine Corps in 2007 as a corporal to attend Ohio State University. This article, first published on 8 August, was updated to reflect a statement on 9 August from the Harris campaign on Mr Walz's comment that he carried weapons ""in war"". It was further updated to add comments on his military service from Mr Walz on 13 August.  What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jpwz19e98o,"Who is Gwen Walz, wife of Harris's VP pick?","A educator and prison reform advocate, Gwen Walz advises her husband from an office in the Minnesota capitol.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"America was introduced to a fresh political family earlier this month when Vice-President Kamala Harris appointed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  While Gwen Walz, the two-term governor's wife, may not officially be on the ticket, her background is getting plenty of attention too.  An educator for more than two decades and life-long Minnesotan, Ms Walz was an agenda setter during her husband's time in office.  She prioritized education and criminal justice reform, initiatives that could see traction in Washington with a Harris-Walz White House.  Ms Walz, 58, met the Minnesota governor when the two were teaching in Nebraska.  They married in 1994 and share two children Hope and Gus.  Mr Walz has spoken about the couple's infertility struggles, a chapter of their lives that he now brings up while campaigning about abortion access and IVF. Ms Walz has clarified she underwent intrauterine inception, however, which is a fertility treatment that does not rely on frozen embryos and is not affected by abortion restrictions. While Mr Walz created a social-media forward platform for himself during his time as governor, Ms Walz appears to have taken on a less-public role.  She only created an Instagram account in recent days. She also participated in few media interviews as Minnesota's First Lady.  When she does speak publicly, however, it is often about her commitment to education, criminal justice reform and how the two intersect.  ""Education is transformational. And I believe that in every sense of the word,"" Ms Walz said during a 2019 interview with PBS. ""And if we're going to solve problems, we have to look at real ways to solve problems. And education is a real predictor of not going back to prison."" Her first public event as first lady of Minnesota was a rally for restoring convicted felons' voting rights.  Ms Walz also chaired a task force on recidivism and toured state prisons.  “It’s a crucial conversation to have,” Ms Walz said in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio in 2019. “I’m convinced that people are looking for ways to address all kinds of different issues within corrections and within criminal justice.” She is said to advise her husband and she is the first Minnesota governor's spouse to have an office in the state capitol.  Since her launch into national politics this week, she's also been on the receiving end of criticism from the right, especially for comments she made during Minneapolis' 2020 racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd.   In a now viral clip, Ms Walz described the smell of the burning tires and said she kept the window open for as long as she could ""because I felt that was such a touchstone of what was happening"".  Republicans are using the clip to cast Ms Walz, and her husband, as too far-left for voters. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgj29wk8rgo,Biden 'not confident' of peaceful transition if Trump loses,"In his first interview since he dropped out of the race, the president says he is concerned about the transfer of power.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"US President Joe Biden has said he is not confident there will be a peaceful transition of power if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November. In his first interview since he dramatically dropped out of the race last month, Mr Biden told CBS News: “If Trump loses, I'm not confident at all."" ""[Trump] means what he says, we don’t take him seriously. He means it, all this stuff about ‘if we lose it will be a bloodbath’.” Mr Trump’s comment that it would “be a bloodbath for the country” if he loses the election, made as he was talking about the auto industry in March, triggered a wave of criticism. Democrats were quick to reiterate their campaign message that the former president poses a threat to democracy. The Biden campaign used the “bloodbath” comment in an ad - posted on its social media accounts - and a spokesman accused Mr Trump of “encouraging and excusing political violence”. The Trump campaign, however, said the comment was specifically about the auto industry and had been deliberately taken out of context. It sent a fundraising email which said Trump’s political opponents and others had been ""viciously"" misquoting him. ""[They] fully understood that I was simply referring to imports allowed by Crooked Joe Biden, which are killing the automobile industry,"" Trump wrote on social media at the time. Mr Biden has previously expressed concern that his former rival would not accept the result of the election. During the presidential debate on CNN in June - which triggered the crisis over Mr Biden's candidacy - Trump was asked directly whether he would accept the 2024 election results.  “If it’s a fair and legal and good election, absolutely,"" he responded, after initially avoiding the question. Trump made repeated unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020 after he lost that election to Mr Biden.  His supporters stormed the Capitol building in January 2021 in an effort to stop the election result from being certified. Many in attendance that day repeated the former president's claims that the vote had been rigged. In the CBS interview clip released on Wednesday, which was posted on X, Mr Biden also appeared to suggest there were efforts to complicate the post-election certification processes, although it was unclear exactly what he was referring to. “Look what they’re trying to do now, in the local election districts where people count the votes,” he said. ""You can't love your country only when you win."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240802-why-do-underdogs-in-sports-and-politics-gain-support,Why we love an underdog,"From the US election to the Olympic Games, we often root for those considered disadvantaged. Why we do so may reveal more about ourselves than them.",4 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"From the US election to the Olympic Games, we often root for those considered disadvantaged. Why we do so may reveal more about ourselves than them. The rise of the underdog is woven through history's most compelling narratives. From fairytale's Cinderella and fictional Rocky Balboa to real-world Erin Brockovich, we simply cannot resist stories in which the weak and vulnerable triumph over the strong and powerful. We can see this preference in sports. Just consider the popularity of the Jamaican bobsled team who inspired the film Cool Runnings. According to some political commentators, playing up an underdog status may even sway our voting intentions. As someone who had never held political office, Donald Trump pitched himself as the underdog of the 2016 US presidential elections, and the term is now being adopted by Kamala Harris, the Democrat's presumptive nominee in the 2024 Whitehouse race. Psychological studies of underdogs are few and far between. But the small body of literature that does exist can help us to understand why we so often find ourselves rooting for those with the odds stacked against them – and the ways this peculiar quirk of the human mind can influence our broader decision-making. On first consideration, the ""underdog effect"" sits rather uncomfortably with humankind's known fixation on status and prestige. According to social identity theory, we often derive our self-esteem from the success of our group. As a result, we tend to process our idols' defeat as a personal failure, leading us to feel less confidence in our own abilities. That's painful – as any fan of the English football team can testify. Why would we willingly put ourselves through that disappointment by supporting the ""back runner"" who is far less likely to bring us success-by-association? It would make much more sense to align ourselves with the likely winners of any event – so that we can bask in their glory. Some of the first answers come from a fascinating study by Joseph Vandello at the University of South Florida and colleagues in the mid-2000s. To test whether the underdog effect was real, they first examined US students' reactions to the 2004 Olympics. Before the games took place, the participants were presented with a list of five countries' all-time medal totals: Sweden (469), Bulgaria (195), Belgium (140), Mexico (40), Slovenia (6). They were then asked to imagine two of the countries engaged in an upcoming swimming event, and to rate how much they would like to see each country win on a scale of one (definitely not) to nine (definitely). No matter what pair they considered, the US students showed a clear preference for the country that had won fewer medals historically. If they were given Sweden versus Belgium, for instance, they favoured Belgium, but if they were given Belgium versus Slovenia, they favoured Slovenia. Overall, 75% preferred the team with the fewer medals. Vandello's team next probed some of additional factors that might enlarged or diminish the effect. In one experiment, the participants read a short description of two European basketball teams, CSKA Moscow and Maccabi Tel Aviv, which painted one team as an underdog with a poor recent record, and the other as a top dog with a stellar performance. They then watched a clip from a real-life game and answered a questionnaire about their judgements of the team's play. To ensure that the results weren't swayed by any pre-existing biases, the researchers alternated how the teams were presented in the text. Half the participants were led to believe that CSKA Moscow were at a disadvantage, while the rest were told that Maccabi Tel Aviv entered the game on the back foot. In each case, the participants ascribed significantly more effort to the underdog. Rightly or wrongly, we seem to assume that the underdogs will be trying extra hard to make up for their disadvantage, which renders them more likeable. Vandello's fourth and final experiment showed that the appeal of the underdog lives or dies on perceptions of injustice. When asked to pick their favourites from a pair of sports teams, the participants tended to prefer those with the poorest track record, but this effect shrank if they found that the team was awash with cash. Then, the series of previous failures barely attracted any sympathy.  The underdog's plight, it seems, must come from a position of genuine weakness. ""Disadvantage arouses a sense of injustice in most people that they wish to see rectified,"" Vandello's team noted in its paper. Young children do not have these concerns. ""In the early years of life, children side with the stronger party, as if preserving their own interests,"" says François Quesque, a post-doctoral researcher at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France. ""It is only with the learning of moral values that they begin to want to establish some sort of justice or equality among individuals."" In a 2021 research paper, Quesque examined adult perceptions of underdogs' emotions. His team showed participants various comic strips and video clips of two people interacting. For example, one comic strip showed one character – who appeared to be more dominant and powerful – ordering another character first to bring them a drink, then a book, and finally their reading glasses. Afterwards, they were asked, ""According to you, at this precise moment, what does this person feel?"" The question was deliberatively ambiguous: it could have referred to either of the characters. But the participants were far more likely to consider the character doing the serving, over the character issuing the orders. ""The majority don't even consider the dominant person's emotions,"" says Quesque.   Supporting the injustice hypothesis, his team found that this bias depends on just how unreasonably the first character behaves. But other factors may also be at play. ""It could be that high-power individuals are perceived as colder than low-power individuals,"" Quesque adds. People simply don't expect people in power to experience such a wide range of emotions, he suggests, which could lead us to spend less time thinking about their feelings.  Given this deep-seated emotional bias, it may be little surprise that stories of underdogs are so prevalent in the cultural psyche. ""There is an inherent romance in having someone or a team beat the odds to achieve an unexpected outcome,"" says Robert Lount, a professor of management and human resources at Ohio State University. He suspects that we often draw personal inspiration from these stories, which ""highlight to individuals that 'anything is possible' with hard work and determination"". Working with Nathan Pettit at New York University and Sarah Doyle at the University of Arizona, Lount has examined the ways that competitors themselves respond to their status as underdog or favourite. ""Our findings showed underdogs tend to enter competitions with focus on obtaining a win, which can be seen as a 'promotion' mindset,"" he says. ""However, favourites were found to enter competitions with a focus on avoiding a loss, which can be seen as a 'prevention' mindset – a focus on avoiding an undesirable outcome."" These mindsets can shape the ways people respond to different forms of encouragement, he says. If you want to motivate an underdog, it's better to focus on the glory of the prize; if you want to motivate the favourite, you can remind them of all they have to lose. Most of us are mere spectators, of course, but Quesque suspects that our heightened empathy for the underdog could shape our opinions in many different domains – ""justice decisions, politics, [international] conflict resolution, and, of course, sports supporters' behaviours"". ""It appears that this effect is very strong, and can be observed in almost everyone, independently of participants' gender and self-reported dominance.""  If someone is actively looking to expand their popularity, there could be a clear advantage in framing themselves as the plucky chancer trying to challenge a more privileged or established opponent. In politics, for instance, there is some evidence that being labelled as an underdog can increase a candidate's perceived warmth and likeability. More like this: • Why prioritising your friends helps you live longer • The anatomy of a conspiracy loop • How heat transformed the Olympics Kamala Harris has already claimed the term in her first presidential fundraising event. ""We got a fight ahead of us and we are the underdogs in this race,"" she said on 27 July. ""But this is a people-powered campaign, and we have momentum."" If the label sticks, then the public's heightened emotional engagement could boost her ratings in the polls. The underdog effect may be more easily discerned, however, in our attitudes toward the athletes competing in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris over the coming weeks, as we find ourselves warming to the competitors who hope to prove their worth against the balance of probabilities. From UK swimmer Adam Peaty to Dominica's triple jumper Thea Lafond, many athletes are already attracting attention for their uphill battles. We may be awed by the strength and speed of the frontrunners, but it's those that fight against the odds who will capture our hearts. * David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author of The Laws of Connection, which examines 13 science-based strategies to transform your social life, published by Canongate (UK & Commonwealth)/Pegasus (US and Canada). He is @d_a_robson on X and @davidarobson on Instagram and Threads. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl22630pzeo,Nigerian protesters arrested for waving Russian flag,"The army chief warns that it is a ""treasonable offence"" to fly the flag of a foreign country.",6 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"About 40 people have been arrested in northern Nigeria for waving Russia's national flag during protests against the high cost of living and what they feel is ""bad governance"".  Amid this crackdown, army chief Christopher Musa warned that it is a ""treasonable offence"" to fly the flags of foreign countries.  Nigeria has seen six days of nationwide protests, in which at least seven people have died and more than 700 have been arrested. Demonstrators have been chanting slogans such as ""we are hungry"", while a minority have been pictured waving Russia's flag and voicing support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to local media, some of these protesters have called on Moscow to ""rescue"" them. The subsequent arrests are seen as an attempt to stifle any fledgling support for Russia in Nigeria, a leading oil producer and a key ally of Western powers. Several countries in the wider region of West Africa - including Nigeria's neighbour, Niger - have pivoted away from the West and towards Russia after recent military coups. Civilian governments backed by the likes of France and the US had rapidly lost popularity - critics accused them of failing to tackle insecurity, corruption and economic problems. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu came to power in May 2023 after winning fiercely contested elections.  Satisfaction with his leadership has plummeted, with many blaming his policies for the sharp increase in the cost of living.  He scrapped a long-standing state subsidy on fuel in his inauguration speech, causing pump prices to rise. The move also had a knock-on effect on the cost of food and other basic commodities. Mr Tinubu has urged frustrated Nigerians to be patient, insisting his policies would bear fruit.  He has appealed for an end to the protests and held a meeting with security chiefs on Monday to assess their scale. Afterwards, army chief Christopher Musa said: ""We are warning in clear terms that we will not accept anybody, any individual flying any foreign flag in Nigeria. That is a treasonable offence, and it will be viewed and treated as such.""  The Russian embassy in Nigeria has distanced itself from the demonstrations, saying that the flags were the ""personal choices"" of protesters.  ""As always, we emphasise that Russia does not interfere in the domestic affairs of foreign states, including Nigeria,"" it added.  On Monday, the north-western states of Kaduna and Zamfara saw a massive turnout of demonstrators. Kaduna police spokesman Mansir Hassan said 39 people had been arrested there, including a tailor who was ""sewing the foreign flags for the group"".  Close to 40 Russian flags were confiscated, as well as a Chinese one, he added.  A curfew has now been imposed in Kaduna -  the sixth state to take such action since last week, forcing millions of people to stay at home.   In a statement, Nigeria's secret service said tailors have also been arrested in Kano state for ""making Russian flags"".  ""Some of their sponsors have also been picked. Investigation is ongoing,"" it said.  Rights group Amnesty International says 13 people have been killed since protests began last week and accused security forces of using excessive force against demonstrators.  Mr Tinubu addressed the nation on Sunday and said his government was committed to addressing the concerns of protesters.  He added that the protests had been hijacked by looters in some areas, and ending the unrest would create room for dialogue. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgewpzyd91o,Walz has history with China - it's more hawkish than critics claim,Republicans claim the Democratic VP candidate is a friend of the Chinese government. The reality is very different.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Within hours of Tim Walz being declared winner of the Democratic ""veepstakes"", Republican accusations that he is pro-China came thick and fast. ""Communist China is very happy,"" Donald Trump's former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter/X. ""No one is more pro-China than Marxist Walz."" Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said Mr Walz owed an explanation ""about his unusual, 35-year relationship with Communist China"". MAGA War Room, an influential X account supporting Donald Trump, unearthed a 2016 video in which Mr Walz told the farming policy outlet Agri-Pulse that the US and China did not need to have an ""adversarial relationship"". But what does the record show? Republicans may want to weaponise Mr Walz's links to China, but it's pretty slim pickings. Mr Walz's personal relationship with China does indeed extend back decades.  It began in 1989 when, fresh out of college, Mr Walz began a Harvard University volunteer programme teaching American history and English at the Foshan No 1 High School in southern China. He later set up a business with his wife Gwen organising annual summer educational trips to China. The venture lasted more than a decade and by his own estimation, Mr Walz returned to the country around 30 times.  But if anything, Mr Walz has been pretty hawkish towards its government, particularly on human rights. As a congressman, he met the Dalai Lama and – before his jailing – the high-profile Hong Kong democracy activist, Joshua Wong. Both men would place at the top of the Chinese government’s list of public enemies. In terms of his congressional record, there is not much for China to like. He spent over a decade on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China – a body focused on scrutinising the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. In 2016, the same year he met the Dalai Lama, he also invited the then leader of Tibet's government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, into his congressional office to meet a group of Minnesota high-schoolers. Mr Walz lent his strong backing to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses during the city's democracy protests. Jeffrey Ngo, a democracy activist now based in the US, has praised Mr Walz's commitment to getting the legislation passed in 2019. ""We knocked on every door when the #HKHRDA lacked momentum,"" he wrote on X after Mr Walz was confirmed as the Harris VP choice. ""Only Walz answered his.""  Mr Ngo praised Mr Walz as ""the sole House Democrat willing to keep co-sponsoring the bill"". Republican Chris Smith was the bill's other sponsor. Mr Walz's elevation to the Democratic ticket has prompted interest on Chinese social media. He once described his decision to teach in China as ""one of the best things I've ever done"", and there were signs of hope in some of the comments that, if he wins, it may signal better US-China ties. One Weibo user pointed out that Walz's ""unique background gives him a real perspective on China"", and he could ""promote cultural exchanges when... relations are extremely difficult"". But others wondered whether that may be assuming too much. The fact that his teaching posting took place in 1989 - the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing - was not lost on some. The Chinese cannot say much about the massacre for risk of getting censored. They refer to it obliquely - one comment simply said ""if you know, you know"". Foreigners who were in China at that time ""are the most anti-China"", said another user. Indeed, Mr Walz has often spoken publicly about his horror at the crushing of the Tiananmen protests, and in 2009 he co-sponsored a resolution in Congress marking its 20th anniversary. His wife Gwen has said that the events had such an effect on Walz, that he chose 4 June - the day Beijing sent the troops in - as the date of their wedding five years later. She said that ""he wanted to have a date he'll always remember"". For more than two decades after Tiananmen, America's foreign policy was founded on a deep, bipartisan agreement that trade and engagement with China was broadly a good thing. It is no surprise that evidence can be found of Mr Walz expressing views that align with that consensus. On the flip side, Donald Trump's own-brand suits and ties were made in China, and he and his daughter Ivanka registered dozens of trademarks there. Far from being pro-China, Mr Walz's record marks him out as someone who has taken a more nuanced view.  He has spoken of the need for dialogue and cooperation on issues such as trade and climate change - but remains fiercely critical when it comes to human rights. That stance was in evidence from the very start of the relationship. When returning to Nebraska after his year in China, he told a local newspaper that there were ""no limits"" to what the Chinese could accomplish. ""If they had proper leadership,"" he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9e4008252o,Republicans attack Democratic VP pick's handling of Floyd protests,The Minnesota governor's detractors say a slow response led to extensive looting and damage.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Republicans have sharpened their attacks on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz over his response to the mass protests that erupted in his state after the 2020 police murder of George Floyd. Critics of Kamala Harris's running mate have accused him of bungling the response to the violence by being slow to deploy the National Guard. Donald Trump praised his response as president, a recording obtained by ABC shows. At least two people were killed and over 600 arrested during the protests, which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages across Minnesota.  The governor recently defended his actions, saying that his administration tried to do the best it could in a difficult situation.  Mr Floyd's murder by Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, sparked days of protests, some of which descended into riots and looting.  The unrest quickly overwhelmed local authorities, prompting Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to request Mr Walz to deploy the National Guard two days after Mr Floyd's death on 25 May in 2020.  A separate written request for 600 troops came just hours later from the city's police chief.  An email from the time seen by the BBC - dated the night of 27 May - shows that the police chief said the force had ""expended all available resources"" and gave a detailed breakdown of how the troops would be used, including for area security, transport and help with logistics.  But it was not until 28 May - three days into the violence - that Mr Walz signed an executive order activating Minnesota's National Guard, citing ""extensive damage to private property"" and a ""dangerous situation"" for protesters and first responders.  While some troops were deployed that night, they were mostly tasked with protecting federal buildings and were unable to prevent riots which saw a local police station set ablaze.   ""We were abandoned,"" an unnamed local official told an external review of the state's response prepared for Minnesota's  Department of Public Safety in 2022. ""By the time the National Guard even came, mostly everything had quieted down.""  A separate report put together by the then-Republican controlled Minnesota Senate in October 2020 said that Mr Walz ""had the ability and duty to use force and law enforcement to stop violence, but he did not"".  Criticism of the governor's handling of the protests in the summer of 2020 has re-emerged as an attack line from Republicans following the announcement that Mr Walz would be joining the Harris campaign. At a rally just hours after the news, Republican vice-presidential hopeful JD Vance, questioned whether ""black business owners in Minneapolis are grateful"" that Mr Walz ""allowed rioters to burn down their business"". The BBC has contacted the governor's office for comment.  Mr Walz has said the city's mayor did not give him adequate information to provide the soldiers a mission at that time. “Decisions were made in a situation that is what it is,” Mr Walz said at a news conference earlier this month. “And I simply believe that we tried to do the best we can in each of those.”  The reality of the situation on the ground in May 2020, experts note, was both complex and confusing.  ""When everything was unfolding that summer, Minneapolis city leaders were not familiar with the process for asking for the National Guard's help,""  Duchess Harris, a professor of American Studies at Minnesota's Macalester College who focuses on African-American political history and human rights, told the BBC.   ""It was unprecedented,"" added Ms Harris, who was appointed by Mr Walz to be on Minnesota's board of public defence.  Several after-action assessments of the response to the riots also highlight communications breakdowns between city and state officials.   One review, published by the city of Minneapolis in 2022, found that city officials failed to go through proper channels when they requested help.  Instead, they contacted Mr Walz directly to ask him to deploy troops.  ""Governor Walz is a 24-year veteran of Minnesota's National Guard,"" Ms Harris added. ""He pushed the mayor of Minneapolis for details. That was his job.""  The subsequent activation of Minnesota's National Guard was the largest since the Second World War.  At the time of their deployment, then-President Trump reportedly approved of Mr Walz's handling of the protests, according to a recording of a phone call obtained by ABC News. In the call the former president tells a group of governors that Mr Walz ""dominated,"" and praises his leadership as an example for other states to follow. ""I know Governor Walz is on the phone, and we spoke, and I fully agree with the way he handled it the last couple of days,"" Trump said in the 1 June, 2020 call. ""I was very happy with the last couple of days, Tim,"" Trump continued. ""You called up big numbers and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins."" In a statement sent to the BBC, Mr Frey said that he ""immediately"" requested the National Guard and that it was ""Governor Walz, not Donald Trump"" that authorised the deployment.  ""During one of the city's most difficult moments, we collectively tried our best to navigate unprecedented times and do so quickly,"" said Mr Frey. ""Governor Walz is a friend, an excellent governor and I am proud to support him as vice president.""  Michelle Phelps, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of a book that examined the protest, told the BBC that a more forceful response could have inadvertently backfired as authorities sought to control the protests.  ""There's a vision in which if we had had a more conservative governor that escalated the state response in the way that President Trump wanted, we would have seen more violence and more destruction,"" she said.  Some advocates - including civil rights leader Al Sharpton - have also praised Mr Walz's handling of the aftermath and credited him for addressing issues of social justice and police brutality. Mr Walz was re-elected as Minnesota's governor in 2022, two years after the protests.  While both Ms Harris and Ms Phelps said they expect Republicans to continue to attack Mr Walz for his handling of the protests, neither expect the issue will create a political liability for the governor among undecided voters.   ""It's not surprising that Republicans are using this line of attack. It highlights that there are just not that many weaknesses of Walz to attack,"" Ms Phelps said.  ""I don't think it's going to be particularly effective or decisive,"" she added. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cleyjp5qldno,Tim Walz: The ex-football coach and teacher who became Harris's VP pick,"The Minnesota governor is a former public school teacher, National Guardsman and member of Congress.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"With one viral line on cable TV - ""these guys are just weird"" - Tim Walz vaulted into contention for the job of Kamala Harris's running mate. The 60-year-old brings with him a folksy, plain-spoken and sharp-tongued approach to taking on the Republican opposition. He also comes with a compelling resume - a public school teacher, football coach and National Guardsman before he entered politics. His political experience, representing a Republican-leaning district in Congress and then later passing left-wing policies as Minnesota's governor, could have broad appeal at a time when American politics is so polarised. A native of rural Nebraska, Walz farmed and hunted in the summertime and enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He would serve in the volunteer force for 24 years. His father, a public school administrator, encouraged him to join the military before he died from lung cancer when Walz was 19.  The Minnesota governor has spoken of how Social Security survivor benefits sustained his mother, and how the GI Bill paid for his college education. Armed with teaching degrees, Walz took on a one-year teaching post in China around the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. He later honeymooned in the country with wife Gwen Whipple and also organised summer educational trips to China for US students. After returning home to Nebraska, Walz became a teacher and American football coach until his wife - another teacher at the school - drew him back to her native Minnesota. As a coach at Mankato West High School, Walz helped build up an American football programme that led the school to its first state championship. Former members of the team appeared on stage when Walz addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He leant heavily into American football metaphors during his address to party faithful, saying: ""We're driving down the field, and boy, do we have the right team."" During his teaching career, Walz also earned plaudits for agreeing to be the faculty adviser for the school's gay-straight alliance at a time when homosexuality was largely frowned upon. He first ran for office in a very agricultural district that spans across southern Minnesota, which is fairly rural and Republican-leaning. But Walz campaigned as a moderate who cared about public service and veterans' advocacy, leading to an election upset. Over his 12 years in Congress, it was hard to label his ideology. He voted in favour of the Affordable Care Act, co-sponsored pro-labour measures, including a bill to raise the minimum wage, and backed an unsuccessful cap-and-trade effort for reducing carbon emissions. But he also found common cause with Republicans.  He voted to continue funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, supported tighter vetting of refugees entering the US, and tried to block the Obama-era bailout of banks and car companies after the 2008 financial crash. Once endorsed by the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA), which donated to his campaign, he spoke out in favour of an assault weapons ban after the Parkland school shooting and lost their backing. Walz won the 2018 Minnesota governor's race by more than 11 points but his first term was overshadowed by the Covid pandemic and the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Republicans have heavily criticised Walz for being slow to deploy the National Guard even as some protests grew violent, as well as for allegedly failing to investigate a $250m (£186m) pandemic-era fraud scheme in his state. The governor won re-election, albeit by a narrow margin, and his second term has overseen a busy period with Democrats controlling the state legislature by a single seat. State Democrats have enshrined abortion rights, enacted paid family and sick leave, strengthened gun laws, funded universal free school meals and invested in affordable housing. The frenetic activity caught the eye of former President Barack Obama who wrote: “If you need a reminder that elections have consequences, check out what’s happening in Minnesota.” Largely unknown on the national scene, Walz quickly gathered buzz during the running-mate vetting period for his acerbic descriptions of Republicans. ""These are weird people on the other side,"" he told MSNBC, a label that has since been widely repeated. ""They want to ban books. They want to be in your [doctor's] exam room."" But Republicans have been quick to characterise what he has done in Minnesota as too radical for ordinary Americans. Tom Emmer, the third-highest ranking Republican in the US House of Representatives, accused Walz of trying ""to turn Minnesota into Kamala Harris’s home state of California"". Since his selection, Walz has also drawn scrutiny over his military record after Republicans revived old allegations from other veterans. Walz said his record ""speaks for itself"" but admitted he occasionally ""misspoke"". Allies, including labour leaders, believe Walz can broaden Harris's appeal to rural and working class voters. Angie Craig, a House Democrat locked in a competitive race for re-election, praised Walz as ""a battle-tested leader"". As ""a proven winner who has never lost an election across many tough races"", she told the BBC she believed he was the best possible addition to the Harris ticket. Tim and Glen Walz have two children: Hope and Gus. Walz's family attended the DNC, where he called them his ""entire world"". The remark got Gus on his feet, shouting through tears: ""That's my dad."" Ahead of the convention, the Walzes spoke to People magazine about their ""brilliant"" 17-year-old son, saying he had a learning disorder, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and an anxiety disorder - saying these conditions gave him a ""super power"". During his speech in Chicago, Walz made a pitch to middle America by addressing fertility struggles experienced by him and his wife, among other topics. IVF fertility treatment has become entangled in America's debate over abortion rights and Walz has repeatedly alluded to the process on the campaign trail. His wife recently clarified that the couple went through a different procedure in order to have children, drawing Republican criticism that Walz had been misleading on the topic. Walz and Harris had their first joint interview on CNN in August, where he said he was enthusiastic about “the idea of inspiring America to what can be”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86llxvyvelo,Trump and allies attack Walz as 'dangerously liberal',Republicans are attacking Walz over his handling of racial justice riots in Minneapolis.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"The Trump campaign and leading Republicans have launched their first attacks on Tim Walz, labelling him as ""far left"", ""dangerously liberal"" and a ""radical"". Kamala Harris said she chose the Minnesota governor as her running-mate for ""his convictions on fighting for middle class families"".  Donald Trump wrote on social media that Mr Walz would ""unleash HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals"". JD Vance, Trump's choice for vice-president, said that Mr Walz was on the ""far left"" of the Democratic party, and chosen because Ms Harris was a ""radical herself"".  Mr Vance and other Republicans focused on Mr Walz's response to rioting in Minneapolis over the murder of George Floyd in 2020, where he waited two days to deploy the National Guard. Mr Vance said Mr Walz had ""allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020"", a claim echoed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis. ""He sat back and let the city of Minneapolis burn,"" said Mr DeSantis. State officials say several nights of rioting in the Twin Cities destroyed several dozen buildings and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. The killing of Mr Floyd by a police officer sparked nationwide protests over police brutality, with millions demonstrating peacefully. But some protests - in both Democratic and Republic-run states - saw looting, rioting and arson.  Mr Walz also faced criticism for a video from a White Dudes for Harris event last week, during which he said Democrats should not ""shy away from our progressive values"".  “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighbourliness,"" he said, prompting a backlash from Senate Republicans, who wrote in a post on X that Ms Harris and Mr Walz were the ""most extreme ticket in history"".  Other prominent Republicans framed Mr Walz as a weak choice, and claimed he would boost Trump's chances in November's election.  ""Tim Walz? What a relief,"" Trump's former senior adviser Kellyanne Conway wrote on Twitter/X.  Trump and his allies have already attempted to frame Ms Harris as an ""ultra-liberal"" candidate on her own, attacking her handling of border security as well as the Biden administration's economic policies."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2j3353vvdvo,RFK Jr admits dumping bear carcass in New York's Central Park,Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr says the 2014 incident that mystified New Yorkers was a prank.,6 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park in 2014. The clip, posted on X account on Sunday, shows the independent presidential candidate describing to US actress Roseanne Barr the incident that mystified New Yorkers 10 years ago. Mr Kennedy said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving outside the city, and he put it in his van with the intention of harvesting its meat. He shared the anecdote as the New Yorker magazine published a story about the incident on Monday.  According to the New Yorker, Mr Kennedy was ""tickled"" by the discovery of the bear while heading to a falconry outing in the rural Hudson River Valley.  An image included in the article shows Mr Kennedy grimacing with his hand inside the dead bear's mouth after he loaded the carcass in the back of his car.  The magazine quoted an anonymous source as saying that Mr Kennedy ""thought it would be funny to make it look like an errant cyclist"" had killed it.  The account is broadly similar to the one provided by Mr Kennedy on Sunday. In his video, Mr Kennedy tells Barr that he was driving to go falcon-hunting near Goshen, New York in 2014 when the bear was killed.  ""I was going to skin the bear... and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,"" he says. ""And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear."" New York state allows for roadkill to be taken, but authorities must be notified. Mr Kennedy does not appear to have done that.  Instead, he says he continued to his falconry event, then went on to dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen. ""At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad."" That is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car. ""We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,"" he says.  ""The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my God. What did I do?'"" He then notes that a fact-checker from the New Yorker called him and asked whether he was involved, which appears to have prompted him to release this video.  The bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog, The New York Times said in its 2014 story. The carcass had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation told the BBC on Monday that an investigation determined the bear had died from a high-speed collision. It added that charges cannot be brought for incidents more than a year old. The Times' story from 2014 was written by a one of Mr Kennedy's relatives - Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former president John F Kennedy.  Mr Kennedy's story comes as support for his presidential campaign has dwindled to single digits in polls since Kamala Harris entered the race for the Democrats.  He maintains that he has no intention of ending his presidential bid."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36nnrlg3nyo,'She did a really smart thing': Democratic voters like Harris's pick,The BBC spoke to Democratic voters about Kamala Harris's choice of running-mate.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"It's been a busy couple of weeks in American politics since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. On Tuesday, she made her selection for vice-president: Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and a former congressman, teacher and army veteran.  Josh Shapiro and Andy Beshear, the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky, had been in the running, as had Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. The BBC spoke to Democratic voters on what they thought of the choice. Mr Peter was considering supporting a third-party candidate in November when Biden was still atop the ticket but now, he's fully backing Harris-Walz. First of all, it's great for Minnesota to have someone on the ticket and yesterday everybody was going crazy over here.  He's great for the country because he does not bring too much baggage, maybe that is safer. I struggled quite a bit when Biden was on the ticket and I was even leaning towards voting for a third party, so having Harris on the ticket gives me the option to vote for the ticket that I want to vote for.  On a typical day, in a normal situation, this should be a very straightforward easy choice for the American people given the history of the former president. But Trump's people vote and they show up, so this should not be taken for granted. I hope Harris and Walz keep the momentum.  Ms Vaughn, who grew up in a Republican household but votes Democrat, wants to see Mr Walz in a debate with Trump's running-mate JD Vance. He's a teacher of 20 years, he's a rural Democrat, I'm a teacher, I'm a rural Democrat. He's an IVF parent, I'm also an infertility parent.  He's a great pick, I think this is going to add a lot of energy to the campaign, he offers so much.  The Harris-Walz ticket is going to be incredibly competitive with the Trump-Vance ticket.  I would love to see the two VP candidates debate. You have someone who is actually from rural America - who still works as a farmer - versus someone who left his rural roots as quickly as he could and then proceeded to profit off of them after his Ivy League education.  Rural communities had [it] really rough under Trump. We lost our child tax credits, IVF has been under attack since Roe [the federal right to abortion] was dismantled. This gives hope that maybe we will have a strong advocate for those aspects of life that are so close to mothers and children and teachers.  Mr Mansfield believes the Harris-Walz ticket would fight to protect women's rights and the LGBTQ community.  What I have learned about the VP pick is that he has fought for the rights of women to have agency over their own bodies (if we had policies limiting men’s abilities to make decisions about their bodies, there would be riots and revolts), he passed sensible gun policies, legalized recreational marijuana, passed paid family leave, and restored voting rights and invested $1 billion in affordable housing.   I’m so much more hopeful than I was a few weeks ago when our candidate was a president who clearly no longer had the mental capacity to compete with the viciousness of [Trump and his supporters].  I believe that Harris/Walz will work hard to find a pathway to more humane laws, to protect working class people, and to honour the rights of women to make their own choices about their bodies, and to stand up for the LBGTQ+ community.   I’m stoked and look forward to victory in November. Ms Tye initially preferred Mark Kelly as the VP choice but her research on Mr Walz has turned her head.  I'm excited. Walz brings something to the party that Shapiro doesn't and somehow Kelly doesn't seem to either.  He's a fun, engaging guy who gives fun interviews and he has a background that I think a lot of Americans can appreciate.  I think she [Ms Harris] did a really smart thing. Somebody who's a gun guy could bring in some of the people who are really hesitant to vote for an anti-gun Liberal, but Walz has a hunting background and at one point had a positive rating with the NRA.  I really appreciate that he's worked really hard with kids. I love that he facilitated a gay-straight alliance when he was a teacher and he's really worked to make sure that people have a minimum wage that is adequate.  Kamala and Walz will blow the Republicans out of the water.  Mr Chandler thinks Mr Walz is the perfect choice to shore up Democratic support.  Looking at all Walz's policies, he's a very progressive pick.  I really like that he stood up for unions, I really appreciate that he fought so hard for kids to be able to have free lunches in schools in his state.  He has been very adamant about needing peace in Gaza. I'm really happy with the pick because he feels more inspiring, he reminds me of a really nice grandpa, even though he's basically the same age as Kamala Harris.   I like that someone who has been a big proponent of helping people who are struggling is the pick. It's what we need right now in this country.  The Harris-Walz ticket is more representative of the wider American public than the Trump-Vance ticket: it makes me feel a lot more inspired for this election.  Ms Mendenhall said she would have reluctantly voted for Mr Biden and Ms Harris. Now she's excited by the Harris-Walz ticket.  I was pleasantly surprised, it seemed like it was going to go to Josh Shapiro but I think Tim Walz was the better choice.  I don't know that much about him but I know he's been a really good governor in Minnesota and seems to support progressive values.  I'm cautiously optimistic, I know it's going to be difficult, but Walz compared to Vance - there's really no comparison.  I would love to see the two of them debate, I don't know if that will happen, but I do feel pretty good about it.  It's amazing how within a matter of a few weeks the outlook for the election really turned around.  With Biden and Harris there was essentially no hope of winning, but now there is at least a fighting chance to win. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dpjgrr3vdo,Inside Bangladesh: BBC finds country in shock but dreaming of change,"With police on strike, students direct traffic and wonder what comes next after PM quit and fled.",7 Aug 2024,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,BBC,USA,"In Dhaka, students are on the streets directing traffic and keeping things running as police stage a strike following the popular uprising that toppled prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The police, normally highly visible, are nowhere to be seen on the usually loud and congested streets of the Bangladeshi capital. It seems that only students and some paramilitary forces are trying to maintain law and order, after weeks of unrest in which hundreds have been killed. An interim government is promised, but has yet to take office.  Police now fear for their safety after the deadly crackdown that caused so much anger. It failed to quell anti-government protests that had begun over civil service job quotas last month.  Things are calmer two days after Ms Hasina escaped to India, but there are continuing reports of sporadic looting and violence during the power vacuum. Many Bangladeshis, particularly the young, hope the country is at a turning point. “I want freedom of expression. I want a corruption-free country. I want people to have the right to protest,” Noorjahan Mily, 21, an Open University student, told the BBC. “I am uncertain about where the country is heading, because the government has changed. But whether the discrimination will remain or not, I will only be happy when their demands are met.” The country is now trying to come to terms with the shock of what has just happened, now that power has been prised from the hands of the country's long-time ruler. More than 400 people were killed in the recent unrest, most of them civilians shot by security forces, but also a number of police. It’s the bloodiest episode since the war that brought the country independence in 1971.  At the airport, a worker handed me my bags, telling me the situation is very bad and the government used too much force. “Many kids – as young as six, seven and eight – were killed,” he said. Outside the airport, students wearing orange hi-vis vests were directing traffic. “There’s no police here, only students,” the driver said. “There is no government, students are doing 100% security.” He agreed with the students, saying they had done a good thing. As we drove on, a group of students were putting out plastic cones to control the flow of vehicles. “I’m here to protect my brothers and help with the traffic. From the very beginning, I participated in the quota movement that turned into a massive movement,” Julkernayeem Rahat, a business administration student at University of Asia Pacific, told the BBC.   “We are happy we’ve removed the autocratic government. We have gained our freedom and our sovereignty.” He was confident that the man named as interim leader, Nobel Laureate Muhammed Yunus, will be able to form a government after a few months ""with the help of students, lawyers, general people”. “Bangladesh’s future is in the hands of the student leaders. God willing, things will be good,” said the 22-year-old. Mahamudul Hassan, 21, is studying on the same course. “I want democracy so that people of all walks of life can enjoy equal opportunities, equal rights.” He’s hoping for “a leader who can make those things happen”. Mr Yunus was appointed to the post late on Tuesday by Bangladesh's president, meeting a key demand of student protesters, who said they would not accept an army-led government. He is now heading back from having surgery in France and could be sworn in on Thursday. ""I'm looking forward to going back home and see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we're in,"" he told reporters on Wednesday at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, where he was due to fly to Dhaka. Following reports of looting and revenge attacks on supporters of Sheikh Hasina, he has urged people to refrain from all kinds of violence, warning that if they did not, they risked everything being destroyed.  In an address to the nation on Wednesday, the army chief said he was certain Mr Yunus ""will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process and that we will benefit from this"". How things turn out is still to be determined – but as far as traffic management goes, the students seem to be doing a good job. The BBC found it flowing much better than when we visited in January for controversial elections, boycotted by the main opposition, that handed Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League a fourth term in power. It almost seemed like business as usual when we saw a group of men pulling large metal rods for a construction project. “The traffic system is better now. The students are managing well. It’s better than when the police were here,” said Mohammed Shwapan, who has been a Dhaka driver for 24 years. “Today is busier than yesterday.” He supports the choice of interim leader. “As Mr Yunus is well known internationally, he can mitigate any potential economic collapse. “I am worried about the international debt, how will Bangladesh be able to manage payments. That's why I think he can do a good job.” The challenges ahead are enormous, and not just economic. There are many wounds to heal after Sheikh Hasina’s 15 years in power ended on Monday. Her government is credited with economic reforms that have improved the standard of living for many in Bangladesh. But she was also accused of serious human rights abuses, including numerous extra-judicial killings and forced disappearances. Many people have stories to tell of what their families went through. On the plane to Dhaka, I managed to close my eyes for a few minutes. When I opened them, I found a handwritten note on an airsick bag in the back pocket of the seat in front. On it, someone had written that his father was killed by Sheikh Hasina and his brother abducted. He had been in self-imposed exile for the last eight years for the safety of his wife and children. Now he is coming back to what he calls “a free country”, to visit his father’s grave, the note said."
