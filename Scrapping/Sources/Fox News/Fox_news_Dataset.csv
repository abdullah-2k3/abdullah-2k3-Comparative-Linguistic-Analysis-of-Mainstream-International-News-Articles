The NBA exports content to China and gets paid for it. I'm ok with that,"" Cuban wrote in response. Inthat same post, Cuban promoted a film he claims to have produced about Chinese influence in the American stock market.Cuban's response was the result of a branching dialogue of different mentions, responses and re-shares with captions that originated from a single post of him posing with former President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMCuban clarified that the post did not mean he is endorsing Trump.Meanwhile, Cuban has been complicit and an advocate of the NBA's partnership with China despite multiple human rights violations that include the Uyghur genocide, coercive population control through forced abortion, forced sterilization, and involuntary implantation of birth control and forced labor in facilities nearby or affiliated with internment camps. All of those violations have been documented and recognized by the U.S. Department of State.Cuban's team has embraced its relationship with the Chinese government and taken aim at tapping into the country's market so much that in 2018, it evenre-branded itselfwith a new name to target the Chinese demographic. The change switched the team's translated name from ""Little Cows"" to ""Lone Ranger Heroes.""Cuban previously defended the NBA's business with the communist regime in an interview on Megyn Kelly's podcast in October 2020.""They are a customer. They are a customer of ours,"" Cuban said. ""And guess what, Megyn? I’m okay with doing business with China. You know, I wish I could solve all the world’s problems, Megyn. I’m sure you do too. But we can’t. And so we have to pick our battles.""Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban poses for a photo with fans prior to the game against the Philadelphia 76ers as part of the 2018 China Games on Oct. 5, 2018 at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai.(David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images)In that same interview, Cuban did not condemn the genocide in Xinjiang specifically when asked if he would condemn the regime for that issue.""I personally put a priority on domestic issues. When it comes to human rights, I’m against all human rights violations around the world. China’s not the only country with human rights violations,"" Cuban said. ""The way proclamations work in this country, the minute you say them anywhere, you’re going to use this as a headline.""MARK CUBAN SPARS WITH RILEY GAINES OVER HARRIS BORDER CRISIS THAT LET MIGRANTS CHARGED WITH MURDER AND SEXUAL ASSAULT INTO THE USA 2022 ESPN investigation found that NBA owners had more than $10 billion tied up in China, including one owner whose company has a joint venture with an entity that has been sanctioned by the U.S. government. AnotherESPN investigationin July 2020 found that one of the basketball training camps in Xinjiang was called ""a sweat camp for athletes,"" by a coach who was stationed there. At least two coaches left their positions in response to what they believed was mistreatment of young players.Concerns have also grown about the use of forced Uyghur labor in the making of sports apparel for firms like Nike, whose products are then used by the NBA.Visitors walk past China's second nuclear missile on display as they visit the Military Museum in Beijing on July 23, 2007.(TEH ENG KOON/AFP via Getty Images)Cuban's refusal to condemn China coincides with a lack of any major figures in the NBA ever condemning China for its violations or the league's business with the country, including superstar LeBron James.In a rare instance of an NBA executive being linked to opposition to it, the Asian country responded harshly.In October 2019, former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a photo on social media in support for protestors in Hong Kong against the Chinese government. Shortly after, Morey's tweet was deleted, then the Chinese Basketball Association announced that it would be suspending all cooperation with the Rockets. Morey was eventually made to apologize, and the NBA put out a statement characterizing his tweet as ""regrettable"" and clarifying that his support for Hong Kong protesters ""does not represent the Rockets or the NBA."" The Rockets even reportedly considered firing Morey in an effort to appease the Chinese, according to multiple reports.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPChinese President Xi Jinping delivers an important speech at a meeting celebrating the 75th founding anniversary of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing on Sept. 20, 2024.(Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via Getty Images)Meanwhile, former NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom testified before congress in July 2023 arguing that his criticism of China for its treatment of Uyghur Muslims has affected his NBA career.""After the third game, one of my teammates walked up to me and said, ‘Enes, you know this is your last year in the NBA right, if you ever criticize China, NIKE then you never gonna be able to play basketball in this league. So have fun, smile and I hope we win a championship this year because this is your last year, and your basketball career is going to end,"" Kanter wrote in his written testimony to Congress.Kanter was released by the Houston Rockets in February 2022 and has not played in the NBA since then. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said that Freedom’s departure from professional basketball has nothing to do with his stance on China.Outside of Kanter and Morey, there have been very few instances of a major figure in the NBA speaking out against China since then, and several NBA stars, including Cuban's own Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic, have made trips to China as part of the NBA China Games.Back in February, Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai told reporters that the NBA is ""in a very good place"" in its relationship with China, more than four years after Beijing took the league's games off-air following Morey's remarks.""China is actually the NBA’s biggest fan base. So what happened before, I think it's water under the bridge,"" Tsai said.Meanwhile, Taiwan’s top official in the U.S. is warning that China has ramped up its aggression towardthe island, and that its people are ready to fight.

""I've been there about 30 times,"" Walz told an agriculture-focused publication the same year.However, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson recently acknowledged toMinnesota Public Radiothat the number was ""closer to 15 times.""The revision comes amid growing scrutiny from GOP critics over Walz's potential ties to the People's Republic of China and its ruling Communist Party.

Tim Walz has visited China.(Maksim Konstantinov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)According to Walz's own testimony, he first went to China in 1989 amid the Tiananmen Square uprising. Walz was part of the first delegation of American teachers to ever go to the communist nation during the trip. He was a participant in Harvard's WorldTeach program, which gave Walz the opportunity to live and teach young students in China for a year.Walz apparently enjoyed his time in China so much that after transitioning his teaching career to the U.S., Walz continued to take annual trips back to China with his students. Walz eventually set up a company with his wife Gwen, called Educational Travel Adventures, Inc., which was dedicated to taking students on trips to China and other international destinations. The two even honeymooned in China on one of their trips in 1993. Walz's annual trips with students took place between 1993 and the early 2000s, before he began running for public office.FANS BOO TIM WALZ AS HE LEAVES MICHIGAN-MINNESOTA GAME: ‘GET OUT OF HERE’Walz and his wife dissolved their student-travel company after he won his seat in Congress in 2006. However,Walz's Chinaexperience was a matter of pride for the now-vice presidential candidate when he was trying to join Congress.Walz'scampaign websiteat the time, for instance, highlighted his work as a visiting fellow at Macau Polytechnic University, a university in China with ties to the CCP.""What we need in education, what we need in the military, and what we need when I'm fostering cultural exchanges with China, is real solutions,"" Walz also said when he debated incumbent GOP Rep. Gil Gutknecht in 2006, once again highlighting his work in China.However, after Walz became Harris' running mate this year, Minnesota Public Radio began trying to verify the ""dozens"" of trips he claimed to have gone on. In the end, they could only verify that about 12 of them had actually occurred.FOX NEWS MEDIA WILL PRESENT SPECIAL LIVE PROGRAMMING OF VANCE-WALZ DEBATEWhen the news outlet reached out to the Harris campaign for documentation proving the rest of Walz's trips did indeed take place, instead of offering such proof they acknowledged that Walz had previously exaggerated the number of trips he took to China, and it was actually ""closer to 15 times"" not ""dozens of times.""The national flags of the United States and China flutter at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on April 25, 2024, in Shanghai.(Wang Gang/VCG via Getty Images)Besides apparently misrepresenting how many times he traveled to China, Walz has also been accused of misrepresenting his rank in the Army National Guard as well.""I'm a retired command sergeant major,"" Walz asserted while running for Congress in 2006. However, while Walz did serve briefly with that rank,he retired too early to keep it.Walz's retirement also prevented him from deploying to the Middle East, another point of criticism against the vice presidential candidate who has suggested that he saw combat.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-china-trade-tensions-escalate-surging-production-electric-vehicles,US-China trade tensions escalate over surging production of electric vehicles,"China produces more EVs and green tech than it can sell domestically, and the low prices caused by this surplus supply make the market difficult for American manufacturers.",April 8,2024-10-15,China News,Fox News,China,"Fox News Washington-based correspondent Griff Jenkins has more on the 'startling discovery' about the prevalence of the dangerous products on 'America's Newsroom.'China's burgeoning production of electric cars and other green technologies has become a flashpoint in a new U.S.-China trade fight, highlighted by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen during her five-day visit to China and seized on by former President Donald Trump in incendiary remarks on the campaign trail.China has sharply ramped up its production of cheapelectric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries just as the Biden administration has pushed through legislation supporting many of those same industries in the United States. Concerns are growing not just in the U.S. but also in Europe and Mexico that China will seek to bolster its own struggling economy with a wave of exports that could undercut factories overseas.A U.S. trade group, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, noted in a February report that leading Chinese automaker BYD had recently introduced an electric SUV at the ""astonishingly low"" price of $14,000. China's auto industry poses an ""existential threat"" to U.S. carmakers, the report argued.STOP CHINESE EVS BEFORE THEY DESTROY OUR AUTO INDUSTRYTrump, at a rally late last month in Ohio, charged that China would seek to export cars into the United States through Mexico. The U.S. currently has a 25% tariffs on cars from China that has largely blocked vehicles from that country, but Mexico has a free trade agreement with the U.S.Trump promised to block such imports with new tariffs, but suggested if Biden were reelected it would be a ""bloodbath"" for the auto industry.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, left, shakes hands with Governor of the People's Bank of China Pan Gongsheng, right, as they meet at the People's Bank of China in Beijing on April 8, 2024.(AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana, Pool)So what's behind this new trade fight between the U.S. and China? Here are some questions and answers on the issue:After more than a decade of subsidizing its automakers, China has built a substantial car industry that accounts for 60% of global electric vehicle sales, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.Yet by some estimates, Chinese companies are producing as many as 10 million more electric vehicles annually than they can sell domestically, according to the AAM. That is driving them to sell more cars overseas. Similar dynamics exist in other industries, such as solar panels, batteries, and more traditional areas such as steel.""The concern is that the Chinese are building up a lot of capacity in many industries across the board, including these new technology sectors and if domestic demand does not pick up, they are going to be looking for markets outside the country,"" said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University.It's pretty similar. American officials say they have seen this movie before.In remarks on Saturday in Guangzhou, China, Yellen highlighted the Biden administration’s concerns by recalling a visit a week earlier to Suniva, a solar cell manufacturer in Norcross, Georgia.The company ""was once forced to close down, like other companies across a number of industries, because it could not compete against large quantities of goods that China was exporting at artificially depressed prices,"" Yellen said. ""It’s important that this doesn’t happen again.""China is now the world's largest producer of solar cells. Suniva closed in 2017, but is restarting production with the help of subsides from the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.Steel and aluminum imports surged into the United States roughly a decade ago, after China's government supported increased production after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Those imports were hit with tariffs in 2017 during the Trump administration. Biden has kept the tariffs.""What's new is that the concerns around overcapacity in some cutting edge sectors have become acute,"" said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department official in the Obama administration. ""China’s clearly built an insane amount of capacity to produce solar cells, and similarly large amounts of battery production. Andnow it’s starting to export autos.""Yes, the Biden administration pushed through several pieces of legislation that have provided financial support to clean energy and semiconductor producers. China has even filed a complaint before the World Trade Organization charging that some of Biden's subsidies for electric car purchases violate trade rules.But a report in 2022 by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that China's industrial subsidies in 2019 were double, in dollar terms, the size of U.S. supports.And both Prasad and Setser added that China subsidizes the production of goods, but does little to spur consumption by its own citizens. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. supported much higher consumption with several rounds of stimulus checks, for example.For now, the two sides have mainly agreed to hold talks on the issue.China hasn't committed to any stepsto address American concerns, arguing that its cheap solar panels and other green products are helping the world wage the costly battle against climate change.But the government in Beijing has also acknowledged that manufacturing overcapacity and weak consumer spending are challenges it needs to confront to achieve sustainable growth for its own economy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe rapid expansion of EV production has sparked fierce price wars that are expected to drive some makers out of business. Huang Hanquan, an expert on industrial policy, said that China needs better policy coordination so that it can encourage the development of new technologies without prompting every province to promote the same industry, and companies to overinvest.""I think the Chinese realize how concerned we are about the implications of their industrial strategy for the United States, for the potential to flood our markets with exports that make it difficult for American firms to compete,"" Yellen told reporters on Saturday.""It’s not going to be solved in an afternoon or a month, but I think they have heard that this is an important issue to us,"" she said.Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

""They want to be that country that sets the norms in space.""U.S. scientists have been studying the moon for decades and stayed ahead of the competition when it came to examining themoon’s surface. The U.S. is the only country to place humans on the moon for exploration. During the Apollo 11 mission, a control operator warned astronauts to ""watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit."" He may have foreshadowed China’s space ambitions when mentioning Chang’e. It’s the name of a Chinese folktale about a moon goddess who flies to the lunar surface with her rabbit. It is also the name of China’s lunar exploration program.China performed its first successful soft landing on the moon in 2013 and launched its lunar rover, the Jade Rabbit. It was the first landing in nearly 37 years. Despite the U.S. dominance early on, NASA has not performed a soft landing since 1972, the final Apollo mission.""It’s another reason why we should never leave certain territories, whether it's a poor country in Africa or the moon,"" said Sen.

Its fourth was the first to land on the far side of the moon. The most recent mission in 2020 returned with lunar samples. Next year, it plans to combine the two previous missions and become the first country to bring back samples from the far side. Despite the advancements, Defense Intelligence officials say China likely does not have any more information about the moon’s makeup than what the U.S. has already studied.""A lot of the unmanned things that we've flown in the past certainly have found water at all at the poles of the moon, at the south pole of the moon specifically,"" said John Huth, the Defense Intelligence Agency's chief of the Office of Space and Counterspace. ""It's been some time, but certainly even with unmanned activities. I wouldn't say they know anything more than we do.""Between 1969 and 1972, the Apollo missions brought back more than 800 pounds of lunar samples. Those contained trace amounts of rare earth elements. Scientists who study those samples and imaging from probes believe those minerals are likely to be even more rare on the moon. However, experts acknowledge a physical presence is needed to know the true geological makeup.""One of the things we'll do first when we establish a lunar base, whether it's us or the Chinese, is really assess what's there,"" Huth said. ""We’ve done that remote sensing part. We've brought materials back from the moon, as have the Chinese. So, one of the first things is trying to build a self-sustainable lunar base. And then understand better really what those minerals, what those other things are that are available that either could be used on the moon or brought back in some way to the Earth to be used more effectively.""BIDEN ADMIN QUIETLY RELEASED STUDY SHOWING GREEN ENERGY RECEIVES FAR MORE SUBSIDIES THAN FOSSIL FUELSVisitors look at Chang'e 5's reentry capsule during a Space Day of China exhibition on April 24, 2023, in Hefei, China.(Zhang Yazi / China News Service / VCG via Getty Images)With a permanent lunar base in place, scientists could study the resources on the moon over a long period of time and determine how to use those.""I would say the biggest hurdle is bringing it back to Earth,"" Usowski said. ""It takes a tremendous amount of fuel to bring back something that's worth actually putting towards a true application back here on the Earth.""Some remote sensing has indicated high concentrations of rare earth elements in locations not yet explored or sampled directly.""I would expect they would be found together in similar proportions or similar admixtures [as on Earth].

Psyche is possibly the most mineral-rich asteroid of those studied. It’s estimated to contain $10 quintillion worth of metals. A U.S.-funded spacecraft is en route to Psyche now. It’s expected to begin orbiting the asteroid in late July 2029.Mining on asteroids could prove dangerous. Some scientists warn that drilling could alter trajectories and cause possible collisions.""It’s justthe environment, right? The extreme temperatures, the absence of other things, even with the robotic type of capabilities, would it be feasible to do that extraction and make it cost-effective?"" Huth said.NASA, the European Space Agency and Japan all have plans to explore Mars. Samples from the Red Planet and its moons could arrive back on Earth as soon as 2033.""I don't know that we fully appreciate the bang for the buck, whether that be with helium-3, whether that be with rare earth elements.

Fox News has requested to see the evidence directly. Sources emphasized -- as is often the case with intelligence -- that it’s not definitive and should not be characterized as such. Some inside the administration and the intelligence and epidemiological communities are more skeptical, and the investigation is continuing.What all of the sources agree about is the extensive cover-up of data and information about COVID-19 orchestrated by the Chinese government.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEAsked by Fox News' John Roberts about the reporting, President Trump remarked at Wednesday's coronavirus press briefing, ""More and more we're hearing the story...we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation.""Documents detail early efforts by doctors at the lab and early efforts at containment. The Wuhan wet market initially identified as a possible point of origin never sold bats, and the sources tell Fox News that blaming the wet market was an effort by China to deflect blame from the laboratory, along with the country's propaganda efforts targeting the U.S. and Italy.U.S. Embassy officialswarned in January 2018about inadequate safety at the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab and passed on information about scientists conducting risky research on coronavirus from bats,The Washington Post reportedTuesday.In this Tuesday, March 10, 2020, photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, Chinese President Xi Jinping talks by video with patients and medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province. (Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via AP)Responding to the report, Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Tuesday afternoon: ""It should be no surprise to you that we have taken a keen interest in that and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that. I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural, but we don't know for certain.""""Even today, I see them withholding information and I think we need to do more to continue to press them to share,""Secretary of Defense Mark Espertold ""America’s Newsroom"" on Wednesday, referring to China. Esper added that he wouldn't speak to ""intelligence reporting,"" but that ""most people believe it began naturally — it was organic, if you will. I think in due course, once we get through the pandemic we're in right now, there'll be time to look back and really ascertain what happened and make sure we have a better understanding so we can prevent this in the future.""Sources point to the structure of the virus, in saying the genome mapping specifically shows it was not genetically altered.Speaking to ""The Story"" Wednesday evening,Secretary of StateMike Pompeo remarked: ""What we do know is we know that this virus originated in Wuhan, China. We know there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was. There is still lots to learn. You should know that the United States government is working diligently to figure it out.""Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sits down with Martha MaCallum on 'The Story' to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and U.S.-China relations.Concerning the State Department cables warning about the Wuhan laboratory, Pompeo said the installation ""contained highly contagious materials — we knew that, we knew that they were working on this program, many countries have programs like this. In countries that are open and transparent, they have the ability to control them and keep them safe, and they allow outside observers in to make sure all the processes and procedures are right. I only wish that that had happened in this place.""On Thursday,China'sforeign ministry pushed back on the suspicion that the virus escaped from the facility, by citing statements from theWorld Health Organizationthat there is no evidence thecoronaviruscame from a laboratory.Americans were originally helping train the Chinese in a program called PREVENT well before the Chinese started working on this virus. The French government helped the Chinese set up the Wuhan lab.China ""100 percent"" suppressed data and changed data, the sources tell Fox News. Samples were destroyed, contaminated areas scrubbed, some early reports erased, and academic articles stifled.STATE DEPT LEAKED CABLES RENEW THEORIES ON ORIGINS OF CORONAVIRUSThere were doctors and journalists who were ""disappeared"" warning of the spread of the virus and its contagious nature and human to human transmission. China moved quickly to shut down travel domestically from Wuhan to the rest of China, but did not stop international flights from Wuhan.Additionally, the sources tell Fox News the World Health Organization (WHO) was complicit from the beginning inhelping Chinacover its tracks.Commuters wear face masks to protect against the spread of new coronavirus as they walk through a subway station in Beijing, Thursday, April 9, 2020.

On January 24, for example, Trump tweeted in praise of China’s ""transparency"" on coronavirus.Though they were not speaking for the president, the sources ventured an explanation, saying it was diplomatic talk to make the Chinese ""feel good"" while the investigation was ongoing, with trade and other talks happening simultaneously.In the six days after top Chinese officials secretly determined they likely were facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus, the city of Wuhan at the epicenter of the disease hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people; millions began traveling through for Lunar New Year celebrations.TRUMP CUTS ALL WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FUNDINGPresident Xi Jinping warned the public on the seventh day, Jan. 20. But by that time, more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence, according to internal documents obtained by The Associated Press and expert estimates based onretrospective infection data.""This is tremendous,"" said Zuo-Feng Zhang, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""I don't see any near-term bending of the curve where we actually start closing the gap with the Chinese.""Sadler's comments come after images of the unclassified Office of Naval Intelligence slide have been widely circulated around the internet. The image, which was picked up in a War Zone report, show China's massive shipbuilding capacity as compared to the United States.The slide's authenticity was confirmed by a Navy spokesperson, who cautioned that it was not meant to be an in-depth analysis.""The slide was developed by the Office of Naval Intelligence from multiple public sources as part of an overall brief on strategic competition,"" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""The slide provides context and trends on China’s shipbuilding capacity. It is not intended as a deep-dive into the PRC (People's Republic of China) commercial shipbuilding industry.""The slide shows that Chinese shipyards have a capacity of about 23.2 million tons compared to less than 100,000 tons in the U.S., making Chinese shipbuilding capacity more than 232 times greater than that of the U.S.CCP-TIED EV COMPANY BACKED BY DEMS BUYS UP MICHIGAN LAND MILES FROM US MILITARY BASESA crowd waves flags to welcome the Shenzhen, a Chinese Type 051B Luhai-class missile destroyer, upon its arrival in Tokyo.(Haruyoshi Yamaguchi / Bloomberg)The slide also shows the ""battle force composition"" of the countries' two navies side-by-side, which includes ""combatant ships, submarines, mine warfare ships, major amphibious ships, and large combat support auxiliary ships."" The ONI estimated that China had 355 such naval vessels in 2020 while the U.S. had 296. The disparity is expected to continue to grow every five years until 2035, when China will have an estimated 475 naval ships compared to 305-317 U.S. ships.Another section of the slide provides an estimate on the percentage each country allocates to naval production in its shipyards, with China garnering roughly 70% of its shipbuilding revenue from naval production, compared to about 95% of American shipbuilding revenue.However, that disparity is also concerning, Sadler said, who noted that China would gain a strategic advantage by having a robust commercial shipbuilding sector.""Shipbuilding is a strategic industry, and they realized that a long time ago,"" Sadler said of China. ""The first part was build up your commercial shipbuilding sector … commercial shipbuilding really was the genesis for all of this massive capacity. It's a lesson that you can't have naval shipbuilding without a commercial shipbuilding sector and the Chinese have been doing that for 30 years.""Because of China's centrally planned economy, the country is able to control labor costs and provide subsidies to its shipbuilding infrastructure, allowing the Chinese to outbid most competitors around the world and dominate the commercial shipping industry, Sadler said.US, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, GERMANY SHOW FORCE DURING MILITARY EXERCISE AMID CHINA FEARSOn themilitary side, Sadler noted that the Chinese began to acquire technology from the Soviet Union, later Russia, and Ukraine, modeling many of their naval vessels after technology from those countries.""Then you get more shipyard workers, and sometimes these commercial shipyards, one side's building tankers, LNG ships and container ships, and right next door, they're building cruisers and destroyers, sometimes with the same shipyard workers,"" Sadler said.Sadler argued that the U.S. has not built a comparable shipbuilding infrastructure because builders only have the U.S. government as a customer.""The federal government is the sole customer … your biggest customer where you get your biggest margin of profit is building the big high-tech expensive naval ships,"" Sadler said. ""That's the only show in town for us. And unfortunately, because that's the case, no one's looking to get competitive and building better container ships or the next generation commercial shipping vessel, which is what we really need to be doing.""The USS Theodore Roosevelt leaves its San Diego home port.(U.S. Navy via Getty Images)While much of the attention on China's advantage in shipbuilding has been focused on the country's naval capabilities, Sadler said that the Chinese advantage in commercial shipping also has large implications onU.S. securityand the economy.""In peacetime, the everyday family is just trying to get diapers, baby formula, bottles of water, toilet paper, or during COVID, PPE, masks. A lot of that supply chain, the ships, the movement, the shippers, they're tied to the Chinese market or they're Chinese ships,"" Sadler said.""We had backlogs of containers in China because it was more profitable to hold cargo in China,"" Sadler added. ""It caused a backlog of supply. There were situations many people probably still recall of empty shelves. Part of the reason for that was an over reliance on this global supply chain overwhelmingly centered in China.""US NAVY’S 19K-TON CARGO SHIP RUNS AGROUND IN BAHRAINThat dominance in commercial shipping also plays out when it comes to a potential conflict, Sadler added, arguing that the over-reliance on Chinese shipping would allow China to ""sanction us very effectively"" in response to hypothetical U.S. sanctions if they were to get more aggressivearound Taiwan.""The United States relies on 80,000-plus visits to keep its economy by foreign flag vessels, to keep the lights on … the stores and industries humming,"" Sadler said. ""So, if the Chinese basically deal themselves out of that market, we lose the ability to sustain our economy, and the shocks of that are really not fully appreciated.""Reports this week by the South China Morning Post indicate that China may be closing in on building another giant warship, with online images showing workers at the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard holding flags next to what appears to be a next-generation amphibious assault ship.In a potential direct conflict with China, Sadler argued that the implications of shipbuilding disparity would be ""even more dire,"" pointing to possible rations similar toWorld War II. The consequences of the situation could also be felt in a battle at sea, where China would have the ability to produce, repair and replace naval vessels at a faster rate than the United States.Despite the looming threat, Sadler said the U.S. has not worked toward the goal of increasing the number of U.S. naval vessels.""Every budget for the last three years during the Biden administration … the long-range plans have all laid out a reduction in the size of the Navy when the danger is going in the other direction, it's going up,"" Sadler said.According to an Association of the United States Navy report earlier this year,President Biden'sproposed fiscal year 2023 budget called for a reduction of 15 vessels from the Navy's fleet. While the proposal allowed funding to build nine new vessels, it also proposed a decommission of 24 ships, leading to the overall reduction of the fleet.President Joe Biden(Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images / File)NAVY PILOT MADE CRUCIAL ERROR BEFORE CRASHING F-35C INTO USS CARL VINSON IN SOUTH CHINA SEABiden's fiscal year 2024 budget also called for an elimination of 11 ships, a plan that was criticized by Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the ranking member on theSenate Armed Services Committee.""We should rapidly work to expand our naval fleet,"" Wicker said in a press release earlier this year. ""As I said, China’s fleet size has eclipsed ours, and yet the Department of Defense proposes ship decommissionings. The Marine Corps was unable to assist victims of the earthquakes in Turkey just a few months ago because the Navy lacked enough amphibious ships.""Wicker was at the center of a 2017 effort to set a goal of achieving a 355-ship naval fleet, a proposal that became law in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act after it was signed byformer President Donald Trump.But budget proposals in the years since have fallen short of meeting those expectations, including Biden's 2024 proposal that called for the 11-ship reduction.Speaking to reporters about the proposed reduction earlier this year, Rear Adm. John Gumbleton said eight of the 11 ships were being eliminated before their ""end-of-service-life"" as a result of the ships' ""material condition, life remaining, cost and then time to upgrade.""""These six vessels did not pass that ROI analysis. In addition to the time and money saved with this divestment, we will also free up over 1,500 sailors to support higher-priority efforts,"" Gumbleton said.The Pentagon(Tom Brenner / Bloomberg via Getty Images / File)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAsked about the Navy's fleet continuing to hover below 300 ships during the same briefing, Under Secretary of the Navy Erik Raven told reporters that ""readiness, modernization … and capacity, in that order, are the priorities that … drive this budget.""""We are constantly working with our industrial partners to make sure that we are not only funding but taking delivery of ships on time and in an efficient manner,"" Raven said.The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment.According to Sadler, the failures of the U.S. to adequately invest in its shipbuilding capacity have not been ""a partisan issue."" He argued that ""both parties' political leaders have failed on this count.""Sadler added that lawmakers need to ""get serious about the threat"" and ""put plans and budgets that … grow the Navy.""""We need consistency in the budgets,"" Sadler said. ""We need to find a way to regain a competitive edge so that there is a reason, a profitable market space for young Americans to want to join something that's new, that's exciting, and they can make a really good living in shipping in shipbuilding.

China produced nearly half of the world’s antimony last year.The limits, which kicked in on Sunday, apply to six antimony-related products, including antimony ore, antimony metals and antimony oxide.The U.S. consumed some 22,000 tons of antimony last year.China accountedfor 63% of U.S. imports of antimony metal and oxide last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The next largest supplier, Belgium, offered some 8%.The material is being restricted ""in order to safeguard national security and interests, and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation,"" the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.A Chinese villager weighs antimony ore he collected from an illegal mine at Lengshuijiang. China is now limiting exports of the substance.CHINA FREES US PASTOR AFTER 20 YEARS OF WRONGFUL DETAINMENTThe U.S. and other nations have been scrambling to scale back their reliance on China for key materials for the defense and energy sectors. Yet still, China is theleading import sourcefor 25 essential minerals, including tungsten, germanium, magnesium, barite, antimony, most rare earths, indium, graphite, gallium, and arsenic.It’s just the latest in a set of curbs on exports introduced over the past year.In December, China banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, which followed another ban on exporting technology to extract and separate critical materials.Last year, it slapped export controls on gallium, germanium and graphite in part of a retaliatory trade war after the U.S. limited exports on advanced semiconductor chips to China.""In the first Cold War against theSoviet Union,we were aligned against the Soviet Union with not importing national security-sensitive things,"" said Rob Greenway, a former National Security Council (NSC) official. ""We were a net exporter across the board. Since we've become a net importer across the board, we have massive vulnerabilities, and our regulatory structures have not in any way kept pace with that.""Often used as a flame retardant, the little-known metal antimony, mined in facilities like the above, is used in ammunition, infrared missiles, nuclear weapons and night vision goggles, as well as batteries and photovoltaic equipment. China produced nearly half of the world’s antimony last year.PHILLIPPINES DEPLOYS NEW COAST GUARD SHIP TO CONTESTED SOUTH CHINA SEALast year, China, led by Xi Jinping, slapped export controls on gallium, germanium and graphite in part of a retaliatory trade war after the U.S. limited exports on advanced semiconductor chips to China.""Ourpartners – Japan,South Korea, Scandinavian countries, Central American countries – they're enormously frustrated, because not only do they have the same problem, but we're not making it easier for them,"" Greenway, now a director at the Allison Center for National Security, went on. ""In some cases, we're making it easier for China. We're taxing Taiwan's exports, including semiconductors, more than we are Chinese exports.""Antimony prices have nearly doubled to a record $22,750 per ton this year and export controls are expected to drive them even higher.The new rules require sellers to apply for a sign-off from the Chinese government through a license to sell any related dual-use civilian and military materials and technology, a process which typically takes close to three months.""China’s new restrictions on antimony – which is used in everything from night vision goggles to nuclear weapons to tanks – will require exporters to apply for certain licenses that the Chinese Communist Party could delay or refuse outright,"" said Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va. Wittman leads a working group on critical minerals policy in Congress.""As the largest producer and processor of antimony, the CCP is using the same playbook as it did for gallium and germanium to demonstrate its market dominance and put Western economies at risk – this is why we must diversify our critical mineral supply chains away from China.""One U.S.-based company, Perpetua Resources, is looking to produce domestic antimony with support from the Pentagon and the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

China has its own space station and conceptual plans for a moon base.,May 3,2024-10-15,China News,Fox News,China,"Former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' to discuss the Biden administration's foreign policy in the Middle East.China on Friday launched a lunar probe to land on the far side of the moon and return with samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side.It is the latest advance inChina’s increasingly sophisticated space exploration program, which is now competing with the U.S., still the leader in space.China also has a three-member crew on its own orbiting space station and aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030. Three Chinese lunar probe missions are planned over the next four years.JAPAN'S MOON LANDER HAS SURVIVED LONGER THAN THE SPACE AGENCY EXPECTED AFTER REACHING 3 MONTHS ON THE MOONFree from exposure to Earth and other interference, the moon’s somewhat mysterious far side is ideal for radio astronomy and other scientific work. Because the far side never faces Earth, a relay satellite is needed to maintain communications.The rocket carrying the Chang’e-6 lunar probe — named after the Chinese mythical moon goddess — lifted off Friday at 5:27 p.m. as planned from the Wenchang launch center on the island province of Hainan. About 35 minutes later it separated entirely from the massive Long March-5 rocket — China's largest — that had slung it into space, as technicians monitoring the launch from ground control smiled and applauded.Shortly afterward, launch mission commander Zhang Zuosheng took to a podium at the front of the room and said the launch had gone off exactly as planned and the spacecraft was on its set trajectory. ""I declare this launch mission a complete success,"" Zhang said to further applause.The lunar lander of China's Chang'e-4 probe is seen in a photo taken by the rover Yutu-2 on Jan. 11, 2019. China is preparing to launch a new lunar probe on May 3, 2024, that would land on the far side of the moon and return with samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side.(China National Space Administration/Xinhua News Agency via AP, File)The Philippine Space Agency issued a statement saying expected debris from the rocket launch was ""projected to have fallen within the identified drop zones.""China in 2021 was forced to defend its handling of a rocket booster that burned up over the Indian Ocean after the administrator of the American space agency and others accused Beijing of acting recklessly by allowing its rocket to fall to Earth seemingly uncontrolled after the mission.Huge numbers of people crowded Hainan's beaches to view the launch, which comes in the middle of China’s five-day May Day holiday. As with previous recent launches, the event was televised live by state broadcaster CCTV.After orbitingthe moonto reduce speed, the lander will separate from the spacecraft and within 48 hours of setting down it will begin drilling into the lunar surface and scooping up samples with its robotic arm. With the samples sealed in a container, it will then reconnect with the returner for the trip back to Earth. The entire mission is set to last 53 days.China in 2020 returned samples from the moon's near side, the first time anyone has done so since the U.S. Apollo program that ended in the 1970s. Analysis of the samples found they contained water in tiny beads embedded in lunar dirt.APRIL’S PINK MOON CAPTURED ON FULL DISPLAY OVER CHESAPEAKE BAYAlso in the past week, three Chinese astronauts returned home from a six-month mission on the country's orbiting space station after the arrival of its replacement crew.China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns over the Chinese military’s total control of the space program amid a sharpening competition in technology between the two geopolitical rivals. U.S. law bars almost all cooperation between the U.S. and Chinese space programs without explicit congressional approval.Faced with such limitations,China has expanded cooperationwith other countries and agencies. The latest mission carries scientific instruments from France, Italy and the European Space Agency in cooperation with Sweden. A small Pakistani satellite is also on board.China’s ambitious space program aims to put astronauts on the moon by 2030, as well as bring back samples from Mars around the same year and launch three lunar probe missions over the next four years. The next is scheduled for 2027.Longer-term plans call for a permanent crewed base on the lunar surface, although those appear to remain in the conceptual phase.China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, becoming the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space using its own resources.The three-module Tiangong, much smaller than the ISS, was launched in 2021 and completed 18 months later. It can accommodate up to six astronauts at a time and is mainly dedicated to scientific research. The crew will also install space debris protection equipment, carry out payload experiments, and beam science classes to students on Earth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPChina has also said that it eventually plans to offer access to its space station to foreign astronauts and space tourists. With the ISS nearing the end of its useful life, China could eventually be the only country or corporation to maintain a crewed station in orbit.The U.S. space program is believed to still hold a significant edge over China’s due to its spending, supply chains and capabilities.The U.S. aims to put a crew back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. They plan to land on the moon's south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water.Stay up-to-date on the latest AI technology advancements and learn about the challenges and opportunities AIBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Some of the collaborative research they identified related to military applications like high-performance explosives, tracking of targets and drone operation networks.The House Select Committee on China Competition, together with the Education and Workforce Committee, found some 9,000 joint research publications that were funded either through the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Intelligence Community (IC) published by co-authors with ties to China’s ""defense and security apparatus,"" including entities that are on a Commerce Department blacklist.The new report demonstrates how Chinese researchers are taking U.S. research back to China to benefit their defense industries.(Feng Hao / PLA / China Military/Anadolu via Getty Images)""The purpose of that research funding is to generate advancements that will eventually become applied warfighting and intelligence capabilities to protect America against adversarial nations,"" a summary of the report states.

Berkeley, lawmakers found Chinese researchers who collaborated with U.S. academia and took knowledge they learned back home to help China ""achieve advancements in fourth-generation nuclear weapons technology, artificial intelligence, advanced lasers, graphene semiconductors, and robotics.""Three such collaborations are the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute and Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute. Under the joint institutes, American academics, many of whom conduct federally funded research, travel to China to collaborate on research, advise Chinese scholars, teach Chinese students and advise companies on their expertise.More than 2,000 DOD-funded papers included Chinese co-authors who were directly affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base, according to the report.(Photo by Mark Schiefelbein / POOL / AFP)NAVY PREPARES FOR CHINA CONFLICT WITH NEW STRATEGYAfter engaging with the committees on the investigation, Georgia Tech decided to dissolve its joint institute and cut back its collaboration with Tianjin University.Georgia Tech announced earlier this month that partnering with Tianjin had become ""untenable"" due to the university’s spot on the Commerce Department blacklist.A committee aide revealed that after the report came out, Berkeley announced it would terminate its ownership of the Chinese institute, in part due to a lack of transparency around research being conducted by affiliates of other institutions.The committees uncovered ""significant failures"" in the reporting of foreign funding by Georgia Tech and Berkeley and claimed enforcement of the foreign gift reporting under the Biden administration had been an ""abject failure.""""The Biden-Harris Department of Education has failed to open a single enforcement action under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act in the last four years, despite widespread evidence of lack of reporting,"" the report said.""These undisclosed foreign gifts — likely hundreds of millions, if not billions in total — gives PRC entities troubling influence without transparency and contribute to building the research relationships that pose risks to U.S. national security.""The report also recommended passage of the Deterrent Act, a bill that passed the House last year but has yet to be taken up by the Senate.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Tensions betweenthe NBAand China appear to be waning to the point league Commissioner Adam Silver said games could be played in the country again.It’s been five years since the controversy sparked byHouston RocketsGM Daryl Morey that led to Chinese broadcasters not airing games in the country.But the relationship between the NBA and China has since mended, Silver said Thursday at the Columbia University Sports Management Conference, and he thinks games could be back there soon.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMNBA Commissioner Adam Silver arrives prior to the WNBA All-Star Game at Footprint Center.(Mark J.

We stood by our values. ... Anybody in our league has the right to speak out on political matters.""The rift in the relationship came in 2019, when Morey posted on social media that he supported anti-government protests in Hong Kong.What transpired after the post was financially detrimental to the NBA, according to Silver, because China is an important market for the league.MARK CUBAN DEFENDS NBA'S CHINA PARTNERSHIP DESPITE OPPOSING ‘CHINESE AND ALL HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS’Silver also noted that Chinese officials wanted Morey fired in 2019 after he showed his support for the anti-government protests, leading to a disagreement from China on this issue.In turn, Chinese broadcasts reacted by not airing two preseason games played in the country after theLos Angeles Lakersand Brooklyn Nets traveled to play there. Silver revealed that the league had suffered ""dramatic"" financial losses due to corporate sponsors fleeing and other factors.However, in 2022, the blackout for China’s CCTV ended, which was a good sign in the eyes of the NBA. The league has been adamant about wanting to reach its global audience, while creating new demographics in different countries.Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai also mentioned that the league’s relationship with China is ""in a very good place"" when speaking with reporters.""So, what happened before, I think it’s water under the bridge,"" Tsai said, adding that China is the league’s ""biggest fan base.""NBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks during the announcement of the NBA-backed Basketball Africa League at the Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar July 30, 2019.(Seyllou/AFP via Getty Images)But the league has been under fire for its business partnerships with China for years, in part because of league-backed training camps in Xinjiang, where the government represses the Uyghur population. The United States government has deemed it genocide by China.That was recently brought up to Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban, who posted on X that he is against ""Chinese and all human rights violations."" However, he does agree with the NBA exporting its content to China because the league gets ""paid for it.""Other than the Uyghur genocide, China’s population control through forced abortion, involuntary implantation of birth control and other human rights violations have been the cause for controversy with the country and its acting government.In 2022, an ESPN investigation found NBA owners had a combined $10 billion in China, which included an owner whose company had a joint venture with an entity sanctioned by the U.S. government.Enes Kanter Freedom, a former NBA center, testified before Congress in 2023, arguing his criticism of China’s treatment of the Uyghur people affected his NBA career.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-report-sounds-alarm-chinas-role-destroying-families-deadly-drug-destabilizing-crisis,New report sounds alarm on China's role in destroying US families with deadly drug: 'Destabilizing crisis',A new report by the Heritage Foundation is shining a light on China's role in the deadly fentanyl crisis that has been killing Americans for years.,September 9,2024-10-15,China News,Fox News,China,"Fox News’ Griff Jenkins and Alicia Acuna discuss the latest news emerging from the U.S. border ahead of the new Fox Nation special, ‘Fentanyl: America’s Quiet Killer.’FIRST ON FOX:A new report is shining the spotlight on the role that China plays in fueling theongoing fentanyl crisisin the United States, calling for more action against the communist geopolitical foe from the federal government.The Heritage Foundation released the report, a copy of which was obtained early by Fox News Digital, called ""Holding China and Mexico Accountable for America’s Fentanyl Crisis.""The report, by Andrés Martínez-Fernández and Andrew J. Harding, noted the massive numbers of deaths linked to the drug, which can be fatal in small doses and is estimated to have killed 75,000 Americans in 2023.CITY IN FLORIDA PROVIDING $1M IN OPIOID SETTLEMENT MONEY TO NONPROFITS FIGHTING OPIOID EPIDEMICChinese President Xi Jinping arrives for dinner at the Elysee Palace in Paris on May 6, 2024.(Photo by Daniel Dorko / Hans Lucas / Hans Lucas via AFP)""At the heart of this crisis is an intricate global partnership bringing together America’s top geopolitical adversary and powerful transnational criminal organizations,"" they said.Officials have frequently said that illicit fentanyl is created in Mexico usingChinese precursorsand is then smuggled across the border by drug cartels. It is often laced in other drugs so that users do not know they are ingesting fentanyl.The authors argue that while the Mexican role in the crisis is widely known, the Chinese moves are largely unknown.""Indeed, unknown to most Americans, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is actively funding, supporting, and pushing America’s most deadly drug threat in history. The combined forces of deadly Mexican drug cartels and hostile Chinese ambitions have delivered to the United States a destabilizing crisis and a death toll that each year eclipses the total of U.S. casualties from the Vietnam War,"" they wrote.They note congressional reports that found the CCP directly subsidizes the manufacturing and export of illicit fentanyl materials, as well as a tax rebate program that actually incentivizes the export of some fentanyl precursors in a way the authors say undercuts Chinese claims that they cannot control illegal activities by smugglers and cannot identify which manufacturers are exporting them.Hundreds of pounds of fentanyl and meth seized near Ensenada in October arrive for officials from Mexico's attorney general's office to be unloaded at their headquarters in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2022.(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images)""It may also be possible that China might not have a full understanding of the specific precursor shipment volumes because it does not allocate a sufficient number of inspectors over its pharmaceutical chemical manufacturing industries,"" they wrote.The report finds that chemicals are arriving through air cargo, postal facilities and maritime routes. The authors also point to reports of an increased Chinese role in networks in Canada.OREGON REVERSES COURSE AND RECRIMINALIZES DRUG POSSESSIONThe Biden administration has taken a number of moves to crack down on the fentanyl crisis, including greater access to treatment and increased funding and technology at ports of entry, where the majority of fentanyl is seized. The report notes that the Treasury has sanctioned dozens of individuals and entities involved with smuggling, and has used diplomacy to get China to pledge tougher action against suppliers.However, the authors warned that those successes ""are likely to ring hollow,"" arguing that China has historically used negotiations to get other concessions from the U.S.""Furthermore, China’s announcements ""don’t carry substantial costs for [its] chemicals industry,"" meaning, as long as suppliers can evade rules—which has been documented for years, the production of fentanyl precursors will continue to prove profitable,"" they continued. ""If past patterns are repeated, then the Biden Administration’s fentanyl diplomacy is unlikely to curtail this deadly scourge.""The report also criticizes what it calls ""complicity"" betweencorrupt Mexican officialsand narco-smugglers, arguing that the government has shed the pretext of going after the cartels.The report recommends that the U.S. strategy must accept that it ""lacks good-faith partners in both the Chinese and Mexican governments."" Instead, they argue that the U.S. should ask U.S. intelligence agencies to publicly expose Chinese involvement in fentanyl trafficking, including increasing penalties for financial institutions.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThey argue the U.S. should also facilitate the reshoring and nearshoring of the pharmaceutical supply chains away from China to areas with a competitive advantage, while also working to uncover Mexican ""complicity"" in the crisis.""If the U.S. government continues to passively accept the fentanyl crisis as simply another illicit drug challenge and fails to prevent the CCP from facilitating this deadly trade, hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of Americans are at risk of losing their lives,"" they said.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.He can be reached atadam.shaw2@fox.comor onTwitter.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

He later became a member of Congress and governor of Minnesota.The Wall Street Journal, citing local media reports, reported that one trip to China doubled as his honeymoon in 1994, and he planned his wedding date to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.In an interview from 2016, Walz said he believed there was potential for a strong relationship between China and the U.S., although he also said China needed to play ""by the rules"" on human rights and the environment.FORMER MINNESOTA LAWMAKERS UNLOAD ON HARRIS' ‘PARTISAN’ VP PICK TIM WALZ: ‘VERY THIN-SKINNED’Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Gov.

Mike Waltz, R-Fla., says Congressional Oversight has a lot of questions surrounding the U.S. response to the Chinese spy balloon on 'Fox News Live.'Before becoming a senator,Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.,was not only an astronaut, but he also co-founded a company that specializes in spy balloons, which was funded, in part, by a venture capitalist in China with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party.Kelly, who is reportedly on a short list of running mate contenders under consideration by Vice President Kamala Harris, co-founded Tucson,Arizona-based World Viewin 2012 with a vision to provide space tourism using stratospheric balloons.While Kelly’s company started out with a focus on space tourism via balloons, the vision evolved with the maturing of the company’s technology.""As we matured our technology, we recognized an opportunity for immediate use cases for our technology through remote sensing services to defense, scientific and commercial customers,"" a spokesperson for World View told Fox News Digital. ""Today, our primary business remains providing remote sensing services to the U.S. Department of Defense and her allies by way of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, as well as servicing scientific organizations like NASA, NOAA and others to better understand Earth from the unique atmospheric layer of the stratosphere.""HARRIS EDGES CLOSER TO TRUMP IN NEW POLL CONDUCTED AFTER BIDEN'S WITHDRAWALSen.

Last year, ""Pony"" Ma Huateng was listed by Forbes as the fourth-richest man in China with a net worth of $32.1 billion. Ma is also the CEO of Tencent.The Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 that Tencent collected a trove of data over the years from its mobile app WeChat, the predominant social-media platform in China. The data was collected through its processing of the chat conversations and financial transactions of its over one billion monthly active users, most of them in China. That has made the company’s platform WeChat a powerful surveillance tool for theChinese government,which reportedly regulates Tencent and regularly has it suppress dissenting views.ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE SAYS MARK KELLY WOULD GIVE HARRIS 'JOLT' AS VPIn this photo provided by Chad Fish, a large balloon drifts above the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of South Carolina, with a fighter jet and its contrail seen below it, on Saturday, Feb. 4.(Chad Fish via AP)With Tencent’s tiesto the Chinese government, World View told Fox News Digital on Saturday that Tencent has ""zero access, zero input and zero control"" over the company.""The current leadership believed it was a mistake for the company to accept Chinese investment when it did,"" a company spokesperson said. ""When new leadership arrived in 2019 and learned of that investment, they swiftly moved to ensure World View was protected from any and all involvement from representatives of Chinese investors.""But the company’s early connections with the Chinese capitalist could raise questions as Kelly is being considered as a candidate for vice president, especially after China floated a surveillance balloon over the U.S. in February 2023, which was ultimately shot down by a fighter jet off the coast of South Carolina.WHO IS MARK KELLY?

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/is-the-icc-corrupted-by-china,Is the ICC corrupted by China?,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected to open an investigation into the mounting allegations of genocide against the Uighur Muslims in China, meaning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a free hand to continue what it deems ""re-education"" camps – for now. ","December 22, 2020",2024-10-15,China News,Fox News,China,"Human Rights Watch says the Chinese government is holding up to a million in 'political education' camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang; State Department correspondent Rich Edson reports.For people like Sainawar Rouzi, life in exile is one punctured by the pains of the unknown.""My family never did anything wrong. They never did anything illegal or committed a crime. Now they have disappeared or live in fear – waiting for a knock at the door,"" Rouzi, an Uighur immigrant based in the U.S., said of her relatives trapped in Xinjiang province ofChina. ""We all live in prisons in our mind, wondering how this has happened to our people. I have to be the voice for my family, for the Uighurs. They have no voice.""Many others like Rouzi, a soft-spoken nurse in Ohio, have been risking their safety for years to shed light on the atrocities their minority is enduring some 6,500 miles away: from involuntary abortions and possibleorgan harvestingto human rights abuses, forced disappearances and being confined to concentration camps. Yet hopes of action on a global scale were further dimmed last week.The International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected to open an investigation into the mounting allegations of genocide against the UighurMuslimsin China, meaning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a free rein to continue what it deems ""re-education"" camps – for now.CHINA USES MUSLIM UIGHUR FORCED LABOR TO MASS PRODUCE CORONAVIRUS PPE EXPORTED GLOBALLY: REPORTBeijing, like the United States, is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which founded the ICC in 2002. The court was intended to be the world's first permanent international criminal legal structure to endorse the rule of law, ensure human rights protection, and punish the most abhorrent international crimes.In this Nov. 4, 2017 file photo, Uighur security personnel patrol near the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region. Classified documents, leaked to a consortium of news organizations, lay out the Chinese government's deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities to rewire their thoughts and even the language they speak. (AP Photo/File)Yet activists had carefully been compiling evidence about acts of genocide, includingclassifiedChinese government cables detailing a sweeping surveillance system and extrajudicial detention – much to Beijing's chagrin.""China has tried to avoid the ICC at all costs. Recently, on November 18, 2020, the Chinese government held a press conference in Urumchi and pushed back against the Uyghurs' complaint to the ICC,"" Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, which filed the investigation request, told Fox News.The case put forth was based on operations against the Uighurs residing in Tajikistan and Cambodia, both of which are ICC members. Furthermore, a collective of more than 60 parliamentarians from more than a dozen countries also added their gravitas to the appeal, sending aletterto prosecutor Fatou Bensouda requesting that the international legal body ""play its part in ensuring that the perpetrators of the most egregious human rights abuses are held accountable and prevented from acting with impunity.""However, the office of ICC prosecutor Bensouda stated last week the ""precondition for the exercise of the court's territorial jurisdiction did not appear to be met with respect to the majority of the crimes alleged"" since they appear ""to have been committed solely by nationals of China within the territory of China, a State which is not a party to the Statute.""But for some analysts, the argument doesn't hold weight – raising questions over a broader influence of China in the international community and throughout the United Nations, of which The Hague, Netherlands, is affiliated with but functions independently.""It is truly amazing and revealing that the Chief Prosecutor so quickly determined that the ICC lacked jurisdiction to investigate the alleged genocide being perpetrated against the Uighurs by the Chinese government,"" said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, an Israel-based attorney who has long specialized in suing terrorist regimes and state sponsors who orchestrate human rights abuses on behalf of victims. ""Fatou Bensouda's announcement that since China is not a state member, she is powerless to proceed against Beijing must be contrasted with her ruthless pursuit of war crime allegations against Israel and theUnited States. Like China, neither Israel nor the U.S is a signatory to the Rome Treaty.""HOW US CAN HELP CHINA'S UIGHURS, WHO SUFFER DISAPPEARANCES, FORCED ABORTIONS, OTHER ATROCITIESWhile information filtering out of the rugged, autonomous province remains opaque, broad investigations have revealed that since at least 2017, upwards of 2 million of the minority group have been propelled into detainment camps, which the CCP initially denied but later referred to them as ""re-education"" facilities, as part of an extensive anti-terrorism campaign.Yet fewMuslim-majority nations, fearing retaliation from Beijing, which has a broad global influence in terms of its loans and reconstruction endeavors, have dared speak out. Instead, the U.S. has remained at the forefront and unwaveringly vocal in its condemnation and issuing of sanctions, as well as trade restrictions on goods from the region over concerns of forced labor.Ziba, a Uighur, appeals for her mother's return.(Ziba Murat)Several similarly outraged Western countries have subsequently echoed the denouncement. Finally, at the U.N. in October, 39 member states – including the European Union and Japan – joined Washington in reprimanding Beijing over the proliferating list of human rights misconduct.Yet as many experts contend, confronting China could come with economic and political repercussions.According to Darshan-Leitner, if the ICC did decide to investigate further and indict China, the CCP would likely utilize ""all its political and economic might to derail the investigation.""""China would correctly argue it did not sign the Rome Treaty and the ICC lacks jurisdiction. Moreover, China would flex its muscles and demand all member countries that want to continue doing business with China to place pressure on the chief prosecutor to terminate the investigation,"" she surmised. ""China is an international powerhouse economically, politically and militarily. The ICC is well aware of the pain and havoc Beijing could impose on the court and its officials, including the justices and prosecutors.""Although not party to the ICC, analysts have questioned China's underhanded influence on the court system, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and controversial election to the Human Rights Council in October.In 2000, Beijing's fiscal commitments to the U.N.'s regular budget stood at just $12 million – making up only 1% of total donor contributions. But fast forward two decades, and that amount now stands at around $367.9 million – some 12% of the total – propelling China to the rank of No. 2 donor, behind the U.S. As of Dec. 15, 2020, according to U.N. data, 139 member states have paid their regular budget assessments in full – which includes Beijing, which paid its bill in May, subsequent to the end of the 30-day due period and amid the growing firestorm emanating from the coronavirus fallout, which is believed to have started last year in the Chinese province of Wuhan.Uyghurs people demonstrate against China during the Universal Periodic Review of China by the Human Rights Council, on the place des Nations in front of the European headquarters of the United Nations, in Geneva, Switzerland, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP)However, last year, the ICC green-lit a probe into crimes against Rohingya Muslims in Burma, also called Myanmar, and Bangladesh. Myanmar is not a member of the ICC either. Still, the court determined that it had the authority to investigate the alleged crimes in Bangladesh, which ratified the Rome Statute a decade ago.Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas also pointed out that in 2019, there was a complaint against China for crimes against the Philippines. Still, the prosecutor concluded that the crimes did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court.""This is a general problem with the international legal system. In principle, the rule of law means that no one is above the law. Yet, for the international instances which address international law, that is not the case,"" he conjectured. ""China objectively is big, relatively well to do and powerful. The weight it objectively has is magnified in the international arena because of solidarity among non-democratic regimes as well as gratitude for the money China pours on developing countries with the expectation of political support in exchange.""And in 2015, the ICC opened an exploratory review into the 2014 Gaza conflict after the Palestinian Authority sent a complaint about war crimes committed by the Israeli military. Matas subsequently underscored that ""the international legal system suffers from a double standard,"" and that the contrast with Israel, ""a small country, unpopular in the international arena, is striking.""""Look at the issue only of transfer, addressed for both countries in 2020. For China, as noted, the prosecutor concluded that there was an insufficient basis on which to proceed. The conclusion for Israel was the opposite that, on transfer, there were reasonable grounds to believe that the crime had occurred,"" he argued. ""Yet for Israel, the Prosecutor was addressing the voluntary movement of Israel citizens into the West Bank. For China, the Prosecutor was addressing forcible transfer to death, torture, or cruel and inhumane treatment.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNonetheless, the ICC's Uighur case file remains open – and the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) has confirmed that it has received a request for ""reconsideration"" pursuant to further facts and evidence.View of the International Criminal Court, or ICC, where Congolese militia commander Bosco Ntaganda is scheduled to hear the sentence in his trial in The Hague, Netherlands, Thursday, Nov. 7, 2019.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong)But what that amounts to remains to be seen.""The next step in the case is to provide the prosecutor with further evidence, regarding the deportation of Uighurs from Tajikistan and Cambodia back to China, that she has highlighted is needed to open an investigation,"" added Rodney Dixon, an international human rights lawyer and the lead counsel on the case.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and cosponsored by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would also grant the president the authority to institute further tariffs, quotas and bans on specific Chinese goods. It would end ""de minimis treatment""for China,or the value threshold below which imports are not subject to customs duties.The revenue generated from this, according to the bill, would go towards farmers and manufacturers injured by potential Chinese retaliation, the purchase of key munitions important to a Pacific conflict, and paying down the debt.A group of Republican senators is unveiling a new bill that would cease all permanent normal trade relations with China and double the tariffs on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) goods.((Photo by Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via Getty Images))GOP SENATORS EYE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO CURB CCP INFLUENCE""This comprehensive repeal of China’s PNTR [Permanent normal Trade Relations] status and reform of the U.S.-China trade relationship will protect American workers, enhance our national security, and end the Chinese Communists’ leverage over our economy,"" Cotton said in a statement.""Giving Communist China the same trade benefits that we give to our greatest allies was one of the most catastrophic decisions that our country has ever made,"" said Rubio.Economists forecast that China’s GDP is expected to grow by nearly 5% in 2024.

All of a sudden China wants to start talks on AI and nuclear weapons.""The leaders affirmed the need to address the risks of advanced AI systems and improve AI safety through U.S.-China government talks,"" the White House stated on Nov. 15 after President Biden met with Xi.The B-21 has cloud technology and an open architecture for continuous software upgrades.(U.S. Air Force photo)Little wonder, forthe B-21 is full of AI. It’s the only U.S. Air Force combat plane with the range and stealth to chase China’s mobile missiles and carry the deep penetrating weapons to hit underground bunkers if North Korea or Iran threatens nuclear mayhem.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND US NUCLEAR WEAPONS DECISIONS: HOW BIG A ROLE?China has nothing like this bomber. The B-21 has cloud technology and an open architecture for continuous software upgrades. The B-21’s Pratt &Whitney engines generate plenty of power for onboard AI and electronic attack.The new bomber will take up its role in the nuclear deterrence triad in the 2030s, just as China builds up its nuclear arsenal.For the next few months, theB-21 will be busywith baby steps in its flight test program, like retracting the landing gear during flight. I mean, you can see why they leave the gear down for very first flight. Why risk it.As the B-21 matures through flight tests, it will move rapidly toward combat capability. Rumor has it the actual B-21 that flew recently is nicknamed ""Cerberus,"" after the mythical three-headed hound of the underworld. (I believe it, because the early B-2 bombers had pet names like Fire and Ice, Penny the Pig, and Christine, after the haunted car from Stephen King’s novel.)CHINA'S XI AND BIDEN COOK UP A GIANT ‘NOTHING BURGER’ WITH ALL THE FIXINGSWhat’s certain is this B-21 is not a kludged-together prototype. It’s a production-representative aircraft, and Northrop Grumman has at least six more B-21s in various stages of assembly, heading for a total production run of at least 100 and probably more.The B-21 is a sixth-generation stealth aircraft, with a sleek design that foils radar detection.(U.S. Air Force)The B-21 could be ready for operations in two or three years, with nuclear certification not far behind. Out in the fleet the AI prowess of the B-21 Raider will set a high bar.And China knows it. While China’s diplomats are dangling arms control talks, China’s combat pilots arepressing ahead with AI.""The computer can sum up all situational information and assist military personnel in making more efficient and accurate decisions,"" female Chinese fighter pilot Zhang Xiao told China’s state-run Global Times in March.EXPERTS RAISE ALARM AFTER BIDEN STRIKES AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUELSChina anticipates all weaponry will be connected through ""a fast, stable and efficient communications network, and all the vast data will likely be preprocessed, selected and highlighted by artificial intelligence before being presented to human operators, so the latter can make the best decisions for victory.""Not so fast. The B-21 can keep the upper hand. TheB-21 is a sixth-generation stealth aircraft, with a sleek design that foils radar detection. It’s also the lead component of a new family of systems, including weapons, drones and network capabilities, that will all incorporate AI.Here’s where AI comes in. As enemy threats pop up, the B-21 might pick up an enemy radar scan pattern, use AI algorithms to evaluate it, then pass that data out to the friendly battlespace network – all while routing the plane’s sensors and communications data around the jammers.It’s possible the B-21 may one day fly without a crew.(U.S. Air Force photo)CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONOf course, jammers and electronic warfare have been around since the Vietnam era; what’s new is using AI to process signals and data onboard the aircraft and in tune with a larger network. Basically, you have a system that learns how to fight back and get ahead of enemy moves during the combat mission. The whole field is called Cognitive Electronic Warfare.If you are flying in the B-21 that’s really good, because it opens up immediate options for dodging and weaving on your path to the target. And maybe for slinging countermeasures back at the adversary.Powerful AI also enables the B-21 to interact with unmanned drones or other aircraft in the battlespace network. That’s why AI onboard combat aircraft creates such an important tactical offset to Chinese or Russian defenses – or anything Iran has cooked up.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt’s possible the B-21 may one day fly without a crew. But for now, the winning combination will be two human pilots and all the AI they can use.So you can see whyChina’s diplomats would loveto talk us into stepping back from artificial intelligence in the B-21 and other military applications.

It was the first long-range flight of a Chinese bomber along the U-shaped line of demarcation since March 2015, according to the officials.Over the summer, Chinese bombers flew over the South China Sea and the contested islands, but they did not fly nearly as far as this one, the officials said.At various points in recent long-range flights, Chinese fighter jets provided escorts to the single Chinese bomber.In recent days, U.S. intelligence satellites have spotted components for the Chinese version of the SA-21 surface-to-air missile system at the port of Jieyang, in southeast China, where officials say China has made similar military shipments in the past to its islands in the South China Sea.TRUMP'S TAIWAN CALL, TWEETS POINT TO FLASHPOINTS WITH CHINAIn February, Fox News first reported that China had deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system, the HQ-9, to Woody Island, a contested island in the Paracel Island chain in the South China Sea, also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.The HQ-9 is based on the Russian S-300 missile system and has a range of roughly 125 miles.The Chinese SA-21 system, based on the more advanced Russian S-400, is a more capable missile system than the HQ-9.FILE: A Chinese military plane H-6 bomber flies through airspace in southern Japan(Reuters)Depending on the types of missiles used, it could extend the range up to 250 miles and target not only aircraft, but ballistic missiles as well.The head of the U.S. military's Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris has repeatedly warned in the past year about China's continued military build-up or ""militarization"" of the South China Sea.In October, a US Navy destroyer sailed close to Woody Island in what the Pentagon calls a ""freedom of navigation"" operation.  The Chinese called the act ""provocative.""  It was the fourth such operation by the U.S. Navy in the past year.China has constructed over 3,000 acres of land atop reefs in the South China Sea in the past few years. It now has three runways and has sent bombers and fighter jets to a number of them.TRUMP REMAINS ON DEFENSIVE AFTER CALL WITH TAIWAN PRESIDENTIn August, satellite photos appeared to show China making progress on at least two dozen hardened concrete hangers in order to land Chinese bombers and fighter jets as well as in-flight refueling planes, greatly expanding the reach of the Chinese military.The photos were collected and studied by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think-tank.  They showed the construction on China's man-made islands at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs.Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

But Beijing may also be struggling to come up with a response because of its conflicting goals: keeping peace in the Koreas while countering the U.S. and its Western allies on the global stage.Beijing so far has not commented on the deal — which requires both countries to provide defense assistance if the other is attacked — and only reiterated boilerplate statements that it seeks to uphold peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and advance a political settlement of the North-South divide.PUTIN'S AI DOCTRINE SEEKS SEMI-AUTOMATED MILITARY AS MOSCOW COULD LOOK TO CHINA FOR HELP, EXPERT SAYSThe Chinese response has been ""very weak,"" said Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding that it could be a sign that Beijing doesn't yet know what to do.Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un exchange documents during a signing ceremony of the new partnership in Pyongyang, North Korea, on June 19, 2024.(Kristina Kormilitsyna, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)""Every option is a bad option,"" he said. ""You’re either unable to make a decision because of very strongly held competing views or ... you’re just incapable of making a decision because you just don’t know how to evaluate the situation.""Some in Beijing may welcome the Russia-North Korea partnership as a way of pushing back at America's dominance in world affairs, but Cha said that ""there is also a great deal of discomfort"" in China, which doesn’t want to lose its sway over its neighbor to Russia, doesn’t want to see a destabilizing nuclear power on its doorstep, and doesn’t want to bring the conflict in Europe to Asia.But China isn't raising these concerns publicly. ""They don’t want to push Kim Jong Un further into the arms of Vladimir Putin,"" Cha said, referring to the leaders of the two countries.BIDEN DRIVING CHINA, RUSSIA INTO 'SHOCKING' PARTNERSHIP, EXPERT WARNS: 'BLUNDER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER'Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, declined to comment on the new agreement. ""The cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a matter between two sovereign states. We do not have information on the relevant matter,"" he said, referring to North Korea by the initials for its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters that the pact between Russia and North Korea ""should be of concern to any country that believes that the U.N. Security Council resolutions ought to be abided by."" The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea to try to stop its development of nuclear weapons.Kirby also said the agreement ""should be of concern to anybody who thinks that supporting the people of Ukraine is an important thing to do. And we would think that that concern would be shared by the People’s Republic of China.""One area that China could be concerned about is whether Russia will help North Korea's weapons program by sharing advanced technology, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.""If China is indeed concerned, it has leverage in both Russia and North Korea and it could probably try to put some limitations to that relationship,"" he said.The meeting between Putin and Kim this week was the latest chapter in decades of complicated political and military relationships in East Asia, where the Chinese Communist Party, once an underdog, has emerged as a leading power that wields influence over both North Korea and Russia.That and other developments have raised alarms in the U.S. that Beijing, now the world's second-largest economy, could challenge the U.S.-led world order by aligning itself with countries such as Russia, North Korea and Iran. Beijing has rejected that allegation.Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Beijing doesn't want to form a three-way alliance with North Korea and Russia, because it ""needs to keep its options open.""Such a coalition could mean a new Cold War, something Beijing says it is determined to avoid, and locking itself to Pyongyang and Moscow would be contrary to China's goals of maintaining relationships with Europe and improving ties with Japan and South Korea, she said.Sun added that the rapprochement between North Korea and Moscow ""opens up possibilities and potentials of uncertainty, but based on what has happened so far, I don't think that China's national interests have been undercut by this.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCloser ties between Putin and Kim could weaken Beijing's sway and leave it as the ""biggest loser,"" said Danny Russel, who was the top U.S. diplomat for Asia in the Obama administration.""Apart from irritation over Putin’s intrusion into what most Chinese consider their sphere of influence, the real cost to China is that Russia’s embrace gives North Korea greater impunity and room to maneuver without consideration to Beijing’s interests,"" he said.Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said that Kim is eager to reduce his country’s dependence on China.""The dilution of Chinese leverage means Kim Jong Un can disregard Beijing’s calls for restraint,"" he said, ""and that is much more likely to create chaos at a time when (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping desperately wants stability.""Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

The dueling military and diplomatic maneuvers are meant to strengthen the partners' solidarity in the face of what they see as China’s aggressive military actions in the region.A number of U.S. andSouth Koreanguided missile destroyers and a Japanese warship joined the April 10-12 drill in the disputed East China Sea, where worries about China's territorial claims are rising. The Associated Press was one of several news organizations allowed a front-row look at the drills.Rear Adm. Christopher Alexander, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said the three nations conducted undersea warfare exercises, maritime interdiction operations, search and rescue drills and work focused on communication and data sharing.

The two U.S. allies' relationship has often been strained by the memory of Japan's 35-year colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has been pressing them to cooperate so the three partners can better deal with threats from China and North Korea.This week'shuge parliamentary election defeatof the governing party of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought better relations with Japan, could constrain his Japan-friendly efforts, but experts believe ties will remain stable.The drills focused on improving the three nations’ joint response capability against North Korea’s increasing nuclear and missile threats, South Korea’s navy said in a statement. It said the navies conducted anti-submarine exercises to enhance their readiness against North Korean submarine threats and maritime interdiction training to practice blocking potential illegal transfers of banned weapons by the North.The latest naval exercise is part of Biden's work to deepen security and diplomatic engagement with Indo-Pacific nations. Biden invited Kishida and Marcos to the White House for their first trilateral talks Thursday, and has declared that the U.S. defense commitment to the Pacific allies is ""ironclad.""Tensions between China and the Philippines have risen over repeated clashes by the two nations’ coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea.

He is looking to lead the U.S. in diplomatic relations between the eight Arctic nations: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation and the U.S.His foreign ties prompted Sen. Jim Risch, Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, to write a letter in 2023 asking the FBI for help in vetting Sfraga, Fox News Digital has learned.He negotiated joint partnerships withChinese academic institutionstied to defense and intelligence services and spoke glowingly about the two U.S. adversaries in interviews for different publications – all of which he failed to reveal until confronted by Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff.Dr. Michael Sfraga has been nominated to be special ambassador to the Arctic.(U.S. Arctic Research Commission)Sfraga had to update his disclosures three times, claiming he had forgotten to mention his record of trips and collaboration with Chinese and Russian leaders, Republicans have said.Risch placed a hold on Sfraga's nomination, which prompted Republican infighting. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R–Alaska, recommended Sfraga to the Biden administration, and she defended him to the committee. ""If there is any challenge that you have as a committee, it’s that his expertise in the Arctic is so voluminous,"" she said. ""It takes a while to wade through all of it.""Sfraga was key in negotiating memorandums of understanding – legal documents that establish a partnership – between the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) andChinese universities,including Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which has been designated a ""high threat"" due to its high-level defense research and alleged ties to cyberattacks.The partnership included access to UAF’s IT infrastructure and involvement in policy and legal reviews on any Arctic region subject, in addition to research and exchange programs.In 2021, Sfraga spoke on avirtual panelon ""Cooperation and Environmental Sustainability in the Arctic at Fort Ross Dialogue,"" an event sponsored by two U.S.-sanctioned Russian companies, Transneft and Sovcomflot, and Chevron. His co-panelist was ​Russian Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Cooperation Nikolai Korchunov.RUSSIA, CHINA HOLD BIGGEST WARGAMES SINCE SOVIET ERAThe event stressed cooperation with Russia on Arctic issues. In a 2021 interview with Voice of America’s Russia service, Sfraga claimed Russia and the U.S. were ""not understanding each other"" and that ""the Arctic is an integral part of Russia’s DNA.""In a 2022Newsweekarticleon mountingU.S.-Russia tensionsin the Arctic, Sfraga is quoted lamenting that the Arctic is no longer insulated from strains in the bilateral relationship. He said it is ""not a good thing"" that the Arctic Council canceled a forum with defense chiefs, including Russia’s, following Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea. ""I certainly understand the motives, but it's not a good thing to have that happen,"" he said.In 2021, after Russia's annexation of Crimea but before the war in Ukraine, Sfraga argued for cooperation with Russia in the Arctic.""If both nations, especially the United States, are looking for places to actually cooperate with the Russians like we do in the International Space Station and trying to find a path towards some amount of productive engagement, I would argue that the Arctic may provide for us at least a few of those pathways to a more predictable and stable relationship between these two countries,"" he said.At his Senate hearing in March, he struck a tougher tone with Russia.""Russia’s war against Ukraine has rendered cooperation virtually impossible with Russia, including in the Arctic,"" he said. ""The PRC (China) is attempting to reshape the global aid rules based system in its favor, and increasingly working with Moscow to elevate and advance its presence and its influence in the Arctic in ways that threaten our interests.""In 2017, Sfraga attended the International Arctic Forum in Arkhangelsk, Russia, an event headlined by Putin and attended by numerous other state-sanctioned people. He was a speaker on a panel entitled ""Arctic: Territory of Professionals.""When questioned about the event in a Senate hearing, Sfraga said, ""It’s hard to ignore half of the Arctic, which is Russia, and in the North, it is a big neighborhood, but a small community, and you must engage. And indeed, at one of those conferences, President Putin did provide a keynote address, but I had no interaction with President Putin at all.""Michael Sfraga is looking to lead diplomatic ties between eight Arctic nations.(U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Curt Beach/Handout via REUTERS)Reports show Sfraga has taken at least half a dozen trips to China to participate in panels on Arctic issues.In October 2019, for example, he attended the Arctic Circle China Forum in Shanghai, where he spoke to the panel on the topic of, ""The Arctic Council: A Model for Regional Cooperation.""In November 2018, he attended the 11th Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavík, Iceland, where he co-chaired the breakout session ""China's Arctic Policy: Opportunities and Challenges"" with Dr. Yang Jian, vice president of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.In April 2016, he attended the Fulbright Arctic Initiative Symposium in Washington, D.C., where he met with Chinese representatives from the Polar Research Institute of China and the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration. He also delivered a keynote speech on ""The Arctic in a Globalized World"" at the China-Nordic Arctic Cooperation Symposium in Beijing.Additionally, during a 2018 event entitled, ""The Polar Silk Road: China’s Arctic Ambitions,"" Sfraga is quoted as saying, ""In the United States, we think four seconds long; we think commercials and sound bites and bumper stickers. But the Chinese think in long narratives; they go over decades... [The United States] think[s] about reaction versus being proactive... as we see the polar ice continue to retreat -- and there’s both opportunity and challenge there.""""As the Arctic ice continues to retreat, there’s both opportunity and challenge there. How we best situate our own interests and those of like minds is probably best considered quickly. That doesn’t mean we’re pitted against China. I think there are ways we engage with them in a very productive, meaningful dance forward – and that can be for the good of a lot.

Rob Spalding discusses his take on the conflict, how China is at play and the deadly Afghanistan withdrawal three years later.After six weeks of recess, the House is set to fast-track approval of a slew of China-related bills that aim to counter the U.S.’s growing foe beginning on Monday.With only three weeks of work on Capitol Hill before the November election, the Republican-led lower chamber is dedicating precious floor time to bills that would root out Chinese spyware within the country and set up the next president to take tougher action against Beijing.""We wanted to combine them all into one week so that you had a real sharp focus on the fact that we need to be aggressive in confronting the threat that China poses,"" Majority LeaderSteve Scalisetold Fox News Digital about the planned""China Week.""""I think we can get real bipartisan support for a number of these,"" the Louisiana Republican said. ""They're all bills that should be very bipartisan, because there are things that China is doing right now that are direct threats to our country's national security, and if we get strong bipartisan votes, you have a higher chance of getting through the Senate.""HOUSE GOP PRESSES HOCHUL ON ALLEGED CCP AGENT'S INFLUENCE IN NY""We wanted to combine them all into one week so that you had a real sharp focus on the fact that we need to be aggressive in confronting the threat that China poses,"" Majority Leader Steve Scalise told Fox News Digital about the planned ""China Week.""(Reuters/Mike Segar)Scalise said that four bills will come up under a rule, meaning that they will be debated by the House and that members can offer amendments. Still more will come up under suspension of the rules, meaning that the House is aiming to pass them quickly and without debate.Scalise highlighted one bill that would undo the Biden administration’s guidance allowing Chinese-made electric vehicles to qualify for a $7,500 tax credit. The move enraged even West Virginia’sDemocrat-turned-Independent Sen. Joe Manchin,who helped author the Inflation Reduction Act that allowed for the credit.The End Chinese Dominance of Electric Vehicles Act, introduced by Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., would tighten the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) definition of a 30D EV that qualifies for the credit to exclude those vehicles with significant parts that are made in China.Another bill would broadly ban China from purchasing U.S. farmland. Chinese entities owned about 380,000 acres of agricultural land in the U.S. as of 2023, or less than 1%.HONG KONG LAWMAKERS UNANIMOUSLY PASS CONTROVERSIAL SECURITY LAW, GRANTING GOVERNMENT POWER TO CURB DISSENTAnother bill, the No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act, would prevent the U.S. from agreeing to any pandemic preparedness agreement negotiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) without the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.The House is looking to get tough on China, led by Xi Jinping, to woo voters ahead of the election.""We’re giving an extra buffer so that the administration can't just go partner up with WHO and come up with an agreement that would result in really bad policy for America,"" Scalise said.Another bill, the Biosecure Act, would ban federal agencies that run research labs from using any biotech equipment from any company that could be at risk of harnessing data to send back to the CCP.TIM WALZ SPENT YEARS PROMOTING RESEARCH FACILITY THAT COLLABORATED WITH ‘CHINESE MILITARY COMPANY’Another, the DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act, would prevent any federal money from going to universities involved with CCP-runConfucius Institutes.""You're seeing China get more involved in our higher ed institutions,"" said Scalise.During former President Donald Trump's administration in 2018, Congress ""restricted federal funding to schools with institutes; nearly all of the institutes have since closed,"" according toCongress's Government Accountability Office (GAO).Another piece of legislation would re-establish a task force formed under Trump within the Department of Justice specifically focused on Chinese espionage.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFBI Director Christopher Wray estimated last year his agency has more than 2,000 active investigations related to Chinese spying.The FBI estimates that Chinese counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets have cost the U.S. economy between $225 billion and $600 billion.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

China at the time vowed “consequences” for the action.Woody Island is also claimed by Taiwan and by Vietnam.Diagram including a satellite image of the beach from Feb. 14.(ImageSat International)The missiles arrived over the past week. According to the images, a beach on the island was empty on Feb. 3, but the missiles were visible by Feb. 14.A U.S. official confirmed the accuracy of the photos. The official said the imagery viewed appears to show the HQ-9 air defense system, which closely resembles Russia’s S-300 missile system. The HQ-9 has a range of 125 miles, which would pose a threat to any airplanes, civilians or military, flying close by.This comes as President Obama hosts 10 leaders from Southeast Asia -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Bruneil, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia -- in Palm Springs, many of those leaders concerned over China’s recent activity in the South China Sea. ""The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,"" Obama said Tuesday.Images of the Woody Island beach on Feb. 14 (left) and Feb. 3.(ImageSat International)The Pentagon was watching the developments closely, a defense official told Fox News. ""The United States continues to call on all claimants to halt land reclamation, construction, and militarization of features in the South China Sea,"" the official said.In the past two years, China has built over 3,000 acres of territory atop seven reefs in the area. There are a total of three runways built on three of the artificial islands.This development comes weeks after the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG-54) sailed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island, part of the Paracel Island chain in the South China Sea.The incident drew strong condemnation from China’s defense ministry who vowed there would be consequences.A Chinese military spokesman said the U.S. warship “violated Chinese law” and was a “deliberate provocation.” The Chinese issued warnings to the U.S. ship and “expelled it swiftly,” according to a statement from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. The U.S. Navy denied that any warnings took place.The statement from the Chinese defense ministry warned sailing that close to the island “may cause extremely dangerous consequences.”The incident in the South China Sea in late January came days after Secretary of State John Kerry visited Beijing to discuss regional issues including China’s contested islands in the South China Sea.During a press conference in Beijing with Kerry, China’s foreign minister pledged not to ""militarize"" the disputed islands.""China has given a commitment of not engaging in so-called militarization, and we will honor that commitment. And we cannot accept the allegation that China’s words are not being matched by actions,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.But Wang left himself some diplomatic space for the deployment of weapons to protect the islands. ""There are some necessary facilities for self-defense,"" he added.Kerry said the United States ""does not take sides on the sovereignty questions underlying the territorial disputes.""But his Chinese counterpart was less ambiguous.""I pointed out to Secretary Kerry that the South China Sea Islands have historically been China's territory. China has a right to protect its own territorial sovereignty,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.In early January, China tested one of the runways by landing two civilian airliners on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly island chain of islands. Pentagon officials are concerned that military aircraft could be next.Monday, the commander of the Navy’s 7th fleet, responsible for the waters of the western Pacific, told reporters, “We are unsure where they are taking us,"" and urged Beijing to be more open with its military operations.It could relieve ""some of the angst we are now seeing,"" Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin said, pledging that the U.S. military would continue to conduct freedom of operations missions close to the contested Chinese islands, including flying aircraft overhead.Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/america-locked-china-cold-war-win,China and the US are locked in a cold war. We must win it. Here's how we will,China's leader Xi Jinping had grand plans to defeat the United States and there's no time to waste. We must confront the communist nation on the world stage. Here's our plan.,"December 8, 2022",2024-10-15,China News,Fox News,China,"Rep. Mike Gallagher reacts to Chinese protesters against Xi Jingping and COVID lockdownsPROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy discuss this topic and more on ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum' at 3 pm ET.The greatest threat to the United States is theChinese Communist Party (CCP).America spent decades pursuing policies that welcomed China into the international system. But since then, instead of embracing freedom or becoming a responsible stakeholder, Beijing has flouted international norms while exporting totalitarianism, aggression, and ideological control.To win the new Cold War, we must respond to Chinese aggression with tough policies to strengthen our economy, rebuild our supply chains, speak out for human rights, stand against military aggression, and end the theft of Americans’ personal information, intellectual property, and jobs.We must recognize that China’s ""peaceful rise"" was pure fiction and finally confront the CCP with the urgency the threat demands. To do that,House Republicanswill establish a Select Committee on China in the new Congress.CHINA PUTS THE WORLD AT MORE RISK THAN EVER BEFOREHere's the good news: when the threat is dire, Americans have a proud history of coming together. There is bipartisan consensus that the era of trusting Communist China is over.Two years ago, House Republicans proposed to create a bipartisanChina Task Force.Sadly, Democrats refused to participate, but the Task Force released a comprehensive blueprint built on bipartisan proposals on how to confront the CCP. The establishment of the Select Committee on China will build on the work first laid out by that China Task Force, and it will do it in a bipartisan way.The first step is to restore our supply chains and end critical economic dependencies on China. In 2021, the U.S. imported a quarter of its antibiotics from China. India, a key producer of generic drugs, depends on China for 80% of the underlying active pharmaceutical ingredients–demonstrating that even ostensibly friendly sources of lifesaving drugs oftentimes ultimately trace back to China.FILE – Chinese President Xi Jinping attends the 29th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, Nov. 19, 2022.(Ju Peng/Xinhua via Getty Images)FILE - Chinese President Xi Jinping waves at an event to introduce new members of the Politburo Standing Committee at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 23, 2022.(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)FILE – U.S. President Joe Biden shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping as they meet on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, November 14, 2022.(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)FILE – Chinese President Xi Jinping talks to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan September 15, 2022.FILE - China's President Xi Jinping greets the media prior to a meeting of leaders of the BRICS emerging economies at the Itamaraty palace in Brasilia, Brazil, on Nov. 14, 2019.(AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin, Pool, File)Meanwhile, in 2019, approximately 90% of the world’s rare earth metals, alloys, and permanent magnets were produced in China. The Select Committee will expose ourdangerous dependence on Chinaand advance policies to build secure sources for critical supply chains, either in the United States or in partnership with like-minded allies.To win the new Cold War, we must respond to Chinese aggression with tough policies to strengthen our economy, rebuild our supply chains, speak out for human rights, stand against military aggression, and end the theft of Americans’ personal information, intellectual property, and jobs.It will also work to prevent trillions of American dollars and millions of American retirees from financing communist genocide and military modernization by developing policies to prohibit state and local pension funds—the same entities evangelizing for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments—from investing in China. Our goal will be to promote overwhelming economic superiority. When we have a strong economy, we are safer.PROTESTS IN CHINA ARE ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN COVID LOCKDOWNSConfronting China is also about deterring aggression on the world stage, both military and economic. Taiwan and other allies increasingly find themselves in the crosshairs of military aggression by the CCP. Meanwhile, the CCP advances itsBelt and Road Initiativeto ensnare other countries into its debt trap diplomacy that only benefits the CCP. Further, the CCP engages in unfair trade practices and actively seeks to steal intellectual property from the United States and others.We cannot afford to misread the CCP’s intentions. The Select Committee will make the urgent case for aiding Taiwan in its self-defense and build relationships with our other Indo-Pacific allies.As China uses its growing economy to modernize its military, we must also develop new weapons and stockpiles to project power, preserve our global influence, and protect our forces, including in space and cyberspace.Further, we will look at how the United States and freedom-loving countries can work together to push viable alternatives to the Belt and Road Initiative. The time-tested formula for victory—while deterring war— asPresident Reaganproved, is peace through strength.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERIn addition, winning the new Cold War with China requires defending our domestic institutions. The Select Committee will demonstrate how the CCP uses ""United Front Work"" and authoritarian tactics to cultivate foreign elites and silence criticism of CCP atrocities, as well as shed light on ongoing CCP interference and influence campaigns in a way the American public can easily understand.The Select Committee will expose how the CCP uses lobbying at the local, state, and federal level to advance CCP dogma against our interests and provide recommendations for fixing our weak lobbying laws.Finally, the Select Committee will investigate the CCP’s attempts at infiltrating our academic institutions and the rise and proliferation of Confucius Institutes in the United States as organs of the CCP, as well as how the CCP or affiliated entities purchases land in the United States to the detriment of our national and economic security.We also will seek to shine a light on theCCP’s security servicesoperating in the United States, especially how the CCP attempts to intimidate and spy on Chinese citizens and Americans here in the United States. In doing all this, the Select Committee will take care to distinguish between the Chinese people and the regime that oppresses them.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn the aftermath of the 20th Party Congress earlier this fall,General Secretary Xi Jinpingis more emboldened than ever to pursue his aggressive agenda aimed at the pilfering of the American economy, the destruction of our international leadership, and the subversion of our institutions.At the same time, recent large-scale anti-regime protests reveal the fundamental insecurity of Xi’s authoritarian rule. Through the Select Committee on China, the House will stand with all those in China oppressed by the regime while advancing policies that both deter war this decade and set the long-term path for victory in this new Cold War.Republican Mike Gallagher represents Wisconsin's 8th District in the United States House of Representatives.Republican Kevin McCarthy represents California's 20th district and is the 55th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

""We are fighting for our very existence.""Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-ran Health Ministry in Gaza – though that figure does not break down the number of civilian deaths verses the number of terrorist deaths. Another 700 Israeli soldiers and roughly 1,200 Israeli civilians have also been killed.Israel has faced international rebuke over the high level of Palestinian civilian casualties, and critics have pointed out that Jerusalem's aggressive tactics help drive sympathetic tendencies that lead to recruitment efforts by terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah.Retired U.S. Air Force Lt.

""Hezbollah has significant military capabilities at their disposal.""They have nation state capabilities,"" he added.Hezbollah fighters form a human barrier during the funeral procession of slain top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut's southern suburbs on Aug. 1.(Khaled Desouki/AFP via Getty Images)ISRAEL STARES DOWN ‘RING OF FIRE’ AS IRAN PLEDGES RETALIATIONThe terrorist organization has been significantly backed by Iran for years, receiving weaponry, technological know-how and some $700 million annually, according toIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.But it is not only their strategic capabilities that make them such a threatening force to contend with, it is the group's proximity to Israel, explained Conricus.Hezbollah, based along Israel’s northern border in Lebanon, has plagued Israel’s security apparatus since its founding in 1982 following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which was carried out in response to a series of inter-border spats with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Israel has now found itself encircled by nearly two dozen terrorist organizations, the majority of which are backed by Iran in what has been dubbed Tehran’s ""Ring of Fire.""An arch glorifying Hezbollah and baring pictures of its chief Hassan Nasrallah (R) and Iran's spiritual leader Ali Khamenei decorates a street of Beirut's southern subburb on January 16, 2011.  Draft charges implicating Hezbollah in the 2005 murder of Lebanese premier Rafiq Hariri are likely to be presented under wraps to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon on January 17, 2011. AFP PHOTO/ANWAR AMRO (Photo credit should read ANWAR AMRO/AFP via Getty Images)(ANWAR AMRO/AFP via Getty Images)Jerusalem, in response to its growing threats, developed a security system known as the Iron Dome, which has been operational since 2011, and has on numerous occasions proven successful in blocking the majority of projectiles levied at Israel. However, the most recent war in Gaza has shown that the Iron Dome is not fail-safe andextremist groups can bypass the defensive system, causing an increasing sense of alarm.Security experts agree that Tehran will likely use a multi-layered approach in its next attack on the Jewish state by relying on proxy forces like Hezbollah in an attempt to overwhelm Israeli, U.S. and U.K. defenses — an operational strategy that Conricus believes could prove successful.Firefighters in the Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona battle blazes sparked by Hezbollah rockets and drones on June 3.

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., last week. Negotiations in the upper chamber are more likely to go public next week since the temporary spending patch for the government expires Nov. 17. The current spending deal does not include any additional assistance to Ukraine.While talks behind closed doors began this week, the Biden administration has not publicly asked Congress for a funding package for Israel, which would mainly replenish its weaponry and strengthen its Iron Dome defense. The administration did not put a figure on the supplemental package theWhite Houseis seeking.One source familiar with the talks said congressional members ""brought up what Israel might need"" and ""asked the (administration) their plans."" The administration outlined three areas for Israeli military support: precision-guided munitions, artillery and air defense, also known as the Iron Dome.According to anotherGOP aide, there is more bipartisan support for aid to Israel in both chambers compared to those who are supportive of sending more aid to the Eastern European nation. Ukraine has already received upward of $100 billion from the federal government to aid in its defense against the Russian invasion that began in February 2022.The difference between the two regions, one GOP aide said, is that Ukraine needs much more support on a ""ground zero"" scale, whereas Israel is already an established nation that will likely need a much smaller funding amount to support its fight against Hamas.Fox News' Jamie Joseph contributed to this updatePresident Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House, Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, in Washington, after the militant Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel at daybreak Saturday.

Security Council votes to impose sanctions and designations on groups like al Qaeda, the Taliban or ISIS. But no such sanctions or designations exist for Iran’s axis of terror groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah,"" Richard Goldberg, senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.The Council, under resolutions passed in 1999, 2011 and 2015, sanctions ISIS and al Qaeda, along with associated individuals and groups. The Council’s committee on those resolutions oversees sanctions measured imposed by the council.However, there are no such sanctions in place for Hamas and Hezbollah. The lack of sanctioning comes as Israel is pushing back against Hamas after it was hit by a surprise attack that killed more than1,300 Israelis.""The U.N. insists these are legitimate political movements and therefore can freely work with them,"" said Goldberg, who previously served as the director for countering weapons of destruction at the White House National Security Council between 2019 and 2020.Israeli and U.S. officialshave criticized the U.N., including the Security Council -- which is made up of 15 members, including permanent membership for the U.S., U.K., France, China and Russia -- for allegedly having an anti-Israel bias.

On Oct. 8, 1997, about 10 years after the terror group was organized, it was named as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Hezbollah, a terror group that emerged out of Lebanon, has also been designated a terrorist group by the U.S.Apart from the U.S., the U.K., Israel, Australia, Japan and the European Union are among other countries and regional blocs that have officially designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Leaders from these countries have spoken out about the recent events that have unfolded in Israel.U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, ""The people who support Hamas are fully responsible for this appalling attack.

Among those, we now know that at least 25 American citizens were killed,"" Blinken said at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel.More than 2,400 Israelis and Palestinians have been killed in the Middle East since terrorist group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel Saturday morning.As of Thursday morning, Israel Defense Forces said more than 1,200 Israelis are dead and at least 3,000 are wounded.In addition to the Israeli deaths, 1,203 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday morning and 5,763 have been wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.The war between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day on Thursday.Fox News' Elizabeth Pritchett contributed to this updateHouse Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, claimed Wednesday thatEgyptian officials warned Israelof a potential attack from Hamas prior to the deadly incursion in which the Palestinian terror group murdered hundreds of civilians.In a public address Monday, however, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly denied any such claim.McCaul reacted on ""Your World"" to National Security Council spokesman John Kirby being asked about such allegations during a White House press briefing. Kirby had said he could not speak to ""specific intelligence matters"" and that the White House's focus is cooperating with Israel and making sure Netanyahu's administration gets the ""tools they need.""McCaul said he would not get too specific.""We do know the Egyptian intelligence did refer this to Israel. And I can't get into any more depth than that. But I do think there was a threat-stream out there. It was a failure of intelligence,"" he said on ""Your World.""The Texas lawmaker said he moderated a classified briefing on the invasion with the entire U.S. House, adding Hamas reportedly planned their attack for more than a year.""When the Egyptians did warn Israeli officials, obviously, there wasn't enough done to stop it. This concerns me not just with respect to Hamas, but what about our intelligence on Hezbollah? What about our intelligence on Iran? They say there's no clear link to Iran. I disagree with that.""He went on to call claims from U.S. officials that Iran didn't have obvious complicity with the attack ""absolutely laughable.""Israel launched a ""wave of strikes"" on Thursday thatkilled a senior Hamas leaderand destroyed operational command centers in Gaza, officials said.According to theIsraeli Defense Forces (IDF), one airstrike executed Thursday killed Muhammad Abu Shamla, a senior Hamas naval operative in the Rafah Brigade. Other airstrikes struck operational command centers used by Hamas operatives, where the infiltration into Israeli communities surrounding Gaza on Saturday was organized.""IDF aircraft struck Muhammad Abu Shamla, a senior Hamas naval operative in the Rafah Brigade. Abu Shamla's residence was used to store naval weapons designated for terror against the State of Israel,"" IDF said in a statement.""Right now we are focused on taking out their senior leadership,"" said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman. ""Not only the military leadership, but also the governmental leadership, all the way up to [top Hamas leader Yehiyeh] Sinwar. They were directly connected.""Other airstrikes carried out by the IDF targeted Hamas’ Nukhba elite force.""The Nukhba elite forces consist of terrorists selected by senior Hamas operatives, designated to carry out terrorist attacks such as ambushes, raids, assaults, infiltration through terror tunnels, as well as anti-tank missile, rocket, and sniper fire,"" the IDF said. ""The Nukhba elite forces were one of the leading forces that infiltrated the State of Israel in order to carry out murderous acts of terror against its civilians.""Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with members of the government via a video conference at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 19, 2023. (Photo by ALEXANDER KAZAKOV/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)Russian President Vladimir Putinon Wednesday doubled down on blaming U.S. foreign policy for creating the conditions that precipitated a violent war between Israel and Hamas.Putin made the comments during a forum with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Sudani on Wednesday.During the forum, Putin said that the ""problem"" that Israel and the Palestinians are facing is the result of U.S. foreign policy in reference to settlements in Israel.""Settlement mechanisms have been established, but the United States has neglected these mechanisms over the past few years and decided to regulate everything on its own, did not use these mechanisms and in recent years has relied on meeting the material needs of the population living in the Palestinian territories,"" Putin said. ""In fact, they tried to replace the solution of fundamental political problems with some material handouts. Of course, this is very important for people who have a low standard of living, it is important to solve socio-economic issues.""The Russian president said ""without solving fundamental political issues, the main of which is the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, it is impossible to solve the problem as a whole.""""In addition, settlement policy, in addition, a number of other components eventually led to such an explosion of violence. What's happening is terrible,"" Putin said. ""We understand that the hardening on both sides is very large, but no matter what the level of hardness on both sides, it is still necessary to strive to minimize or reduce to zero, to minimize losses among the civilian population: women, children, the elderly. If men have decided to fight among themselves, let them fight among themselves - children, leave women alone. This applies to both sides.""""I would add that the position of Russia, which you mentioned, and I have just outlined it, has not developed today, not in connection with these tragic events, it has been formed for decades, and this position is well known to both the Israeli side and our friends in Palestine. We have always advocated the implementation of the decisions of the UN Security Council, referring primarily to the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state. This is the root of all the problems. And, of course, all that has accompanied this problem in recent years has aggravated it is settlement activity,"" he added.Fox News' Adam Sabes contributed to this update.In aninterview with FOX News Digital, Combat Antisemitism Movement CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa warned that Israel's critics don't understand the hatred and evil that motivates Hamas.Dratwa discussed the impact of the deadly attacks against Israel by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists. Since Saturday, more than 2,400 people have been killed including around 1,200 Israelis and at least 22 Americans.""We know that Hamas doesn't like Israel. We know they don't like us,"" Dratwa said. ""But we didn't know, and we have been extremely surprised by the animosity of the terrorists, by the hatred that was so deep and so badly that I don't think that in Western civilization we are able to understand how much indoctrination happened in Gaza.""He continued, ""And we're told that they want to build a country, maybe. But now we get a strong message that Hamas doesn't want to build anything. They only want to destroy, and they want to destroy the only Jewish state.""However, since the attack, Israel has faced backlash of its own, ranging from calls for a ""ceasefire"" by members of Congress to suggestions that the country alone was responsible for the violence. Pro-Palestinian protests also took place across multiple cities throughout the United States, attacking the ""apartheid"" state of Israel.Dratwa pushed back against these and other criticisms for failing to understand the situation Israelis face.""So I think this is really my response to the ‘ceasefire.’ You cannot expect Israel to behave differently than other countries in the world. These are double standards, and we are not going to behave differently than how United States, France, Canada, Germany and other countries [would] have reacted to such attack. We're going to react with all our means and everything that every other country would have done across the world, because this is the right thing to do,"" he said.He added, ""This is my response to those calling Israel an apartheid state. I would like to see them being Jewish Israelis for one day and then to understand the situation. I don't think that anyone is able to understand without being in Israel and seeing how small it is.""Fox News' Lindsay Kornick contributed to this update.Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to speak at a press conference around 6:20 a.m. ET alongsideIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu.Blinken just arrived in Israel a short time ago.""I’m in Israel today to make one thing clear: The United States standswith Israeland its people, and we will always stand — resolutely — against terrorism,"" Blinken posted on X.Blinken will meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday, according to multiple reports.TheIsrael Defense Forceson Thursday is accusing Hamas of bringing Islamic State flags to Israel during its attacks on its citizens.The IDF posted an image on X purportedly showing an ISIS flag and other weaponry that has been taken from Hamas since they began launching their assault on Israel this past weekend.""Hamas broughtISIS flagsto massacre Israeli children, women and men,"" the IDF wrote.

In 1967, Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria were involved in theSix-Day War.The war started on June 5, 1967 and ended on June 10. After the war, Israel took control of the West Bank from Jordan. The area has seen violence between Palestinians and Israelis ever since.Following the historic Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians it was agreed that the Palestinians would be given some self-rule.As part of the Oslo accords the West Bank was separated into areas A, B and C. Area A is controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Area B is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, with Israel controlling security, while Area C, which makes up about 60% of the West Bank, is controlledentirely by Israel.Fox News' Ashlyn Messier contributed to this report.Members of the Jewish community in Glasgow gather in Buchanan Street where they held a vigil in memory of the those killed in Israel by Hamas militants, on October 11, 2023 in Glasgow, Scotland.

It is located north of the Israeli city of Netanya.Kibbutz, “communal settlement” in Hebrew, is acollective communitybased on socioeconomic values that joins together based on shared ownership of property, production and education.The concept of kibbutzim dates back to the early 20th century.Young Jewish immigrantsfounded the first kibbutz to establish a new way of life based on socialist and agricultural principles. Kibbutz Degania and subsequent communities were founded on concepts of equality, cooperative labor and self-sufficiency.According to the Virtual Jewish Diary, about 130,000 people live in kibbutzim, roughly 2.5 percent of the entire national population. Many of these kibbutzim are affiliated with one of three major national kibbutz movements, each closely associated with a distinct set of principles and beliefs.Within the kibbutz, a system of direct democracy prevails. The membership convenes in a general assembly to shape policies, select leaders, sanction the kibbutz's financial plan and admit new members. This assembly serves as a governing body and a platform for members to voice their thoughts and perspectives.The influence of the kibbutz onIsraeli societyhas been remarkably significant, leaving a mark on the nation's foundation and the formative years of notable politicians, military leaders, artists and authors.Fox News’ Maeghan Dolph contributed to this report.Soldiers walk past tanks moving outside of Kibbutz Kfar Aza where days earlier Hamas militants attacked this kibbutz near the border with Gaza, on October 10, 2023 in Kfar Aza, Israel.

It's hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart,” he added. “It's heartbreaking.

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., could or should receive an intelligence briefing about the situation.A source told Fox News that the Biden administration could take the line that there is no speaker forthe House of Representatives. Thus, McHenry would not qualify for an intelligence briefing.However, Fox was also told that President Biden's team sees McHenry as credible and a responsible individual, so even though he is not speaker, the administration may be willing to brief him.So far, there has been no call for an intelligence briefing on the Middle East for the Congressional ""Gang of 8."" That group consists of the House speaker, the House minority leader, the Senate majority leader, the Senate minority leader, and the chairs and top minority members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees.That said, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is overseas on a foreign trip to China.Fox is told that a ""Gang of 7"" could convene and leave the top figure in the House out, because there is technically no top figure in the House with the speakership in limbo.Fox has also heard from multiple lawmakers and congressional sources warning of potential problems for the U.S. should there be a need to respond to theMiddle Eastsituation or another foreign policy crisis.The House, currently led by McHenry in its absence of a speaker, could not advance any legislative measure related to the crisis should that be necessary.Fox News' Chad Pergram and Kyle Morris contributed to this update.Enes Kanter #13 of the Boston Celtics during the American national anthem prior to the first half of their NBA game against the Toronto Raptors at Scotiabank Arena on November 28, 2021 in Toronto, Canada.Former professional basketball playerEnes Kanter Freedomcondemned the Saturday attack on Israel that has killed at least 100 Israelis in an attack for which the Islamist movement Hamas is taking responsibility.A senior Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif, announced the start of the operation in which he called on Palestinians everywhere to attack the Israelis.""This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,"" he said in a broadcast on Hamas media, saying that 5,000 rockets had been launched.Kanter Freedom condemned the attacks in a written statement to Fox News Digital.""I’ve been closely monitoring what’s going on in the Middle East,"" Kanter Freedom said.

Instead, he said, they ""fed the world a distorted picture of the reality on the ground whereby it appeared that the resolution was actually being implemented and that everything was okay.""In Israel, military intelligence and local residents have been warning for years that Hezbollah was rearming and moving its forces closer to the border, placing observation posts and even its bright yellow flag in positions that were in clear sight of Israeli communities and army bases.ODDS OF ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH WAR 'INEVITABLE,' EXPERTS FEAR: 'TOTALLY PESSIMISTIC'Fighters from the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah carry out a training exercise in Aaramta village in southern Lebanon in May 2023.(AP/Hassan Ammar)Following the brutal Oct. 7 attack in which thousands ofHamas-led terroristsinfiltrated civilian communities in southern Israel — and the regional tensions around the ensuing war in Gaza — Israeli authorities, fearing a similar attack from Hezbollah, decided to evacuate some 80,000 residents from their homes on the border with Lebanon.In Lebanon, there have been reports that Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed around 1,700 homes in the southern border region and many civilians there, too, have also been forced to evacuate further to the north as the fighting escalates.""We are extremely concerned about the current situation and the potential for the conflict in the Middle East to escalate and widen,"" Farhan Aziz Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News Digital. ""The Secretary-General has warned that any escalation of the fighting would be a catastrophe for the region.""Haq said he believed the resolution had been successful in ""contributing to over 18 years of relative stability for communities in northern Israel and southern Lebanon."" He also said that the U.N.’s special coordinator for Lebanon, whose role is to mediate between Lebanon and Israel, and the UNIFIL force were still intensively engaged in the area.Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah speaks via a video link during the Shiite holy day of Ashoura in Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug. 9, 2022.(AP Photo/Hussein Malla)However, Haq said, ""ultimately, it is the responsibility of the parties to implement Resolution 1701 and its success depends on the parties to re-commit to its full implementation and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities.""UNIFIL, he said, was only there to support this implementation but could not replace the local parties or substitute for a longer-term political process.A former member of the peacekeeping force, who spoke to Fox News Digital on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of his position, confirmed that UNIFIL’s role was not to fight and that over the past 18 years it ""never interfered with Hezbollah.""UN WARNED TO STOP GIVING HEZBOLLAH FREE REIN IN LEBANON — OR FACE CONSEQUENCESFirefighters in the Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona battle blazes sparked by Hezbollah rockets and drones on June 3.

While Jewish sovereignty ended 2,000 years earlier, in the year 70 A.D. at the hands of the Roman conquest, there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the land throughout. The first Jewish commonwealth dates back 3,000 years to the time of King David.That war saw surrounding Arab nations – Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordanand Iraq, (with additional forces sent by Saudi Arabia and Yemen)  –attack the fledgling state. The war led to the displacement of some 750,000 Arabs. At the same time,Arab nations began expelling hundreds of thousands of their Jewish populations, many of whom would settle in Israel.Today’s war in Gaza is a continuation of the many wars and conflicts that have ensued since.

The French and Brits wanted to depose Nasser while Israel wanted to regain access through the Straits of Tiran. An agreement facilitated by the U.S. and Soviet Union resolved the conflict, but the canal remained closed until 1957 due to sunken ships. Nasser remained in power.In 1964, some three years before Israel took over territory won in the 1967 war, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was formed, as well as additional smaller groups, calling for a return to what they consider their homeland. Their aim was the destruction of the State of Israel.

Israel's victory against the Arabs was hailed as one of the most significant victories in military history.Following the Six-Day War, with no serious peace agreement reached between the warring parties, the fighting between Israel and Arab nations continued, evolving into a three-year War of Attrition.The tension is underscored by the Three No's declaration made by the Arab League in September 1967 in Khartoum, Sudan: No peace, No recognition, and No negotiations with Israel.Arab nations, led by Egypt and Syria, launch a surprise attack on Israel on the holiest day of the year for the Jewish people, Yom Kippur.

The war lasted more than three months, with Israeli troops reaching as far as the outskirts of Beirut, leading to the exodus of thousands of PLO members,including Arafat.Despite the withdrawal of the PLO from Lebanon, Israeli troops continued to monitor activities in Lebanon. On Sept. 16, in coordination with the Israeli army, a Lebanese Christian militia group known as the Phalange enters two Palestinian refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila. The Phalangemission was to wipe out terrorists in the camps,but instead they killed many civilians in a notorious massacre.Reports vary on the number of people killed, from 460 to 3,500. Israel held a commission of inquiry following outrage from the Israeli public and found that Israel was partly responsible for the massacre.

It can do this by defeating Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, as well as normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia.",October 4,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"Former CentCom commander Gen. Frank McKenzie says Iranian senior leadership is not in a good place right now amid the Middle East conflict on 'America Reports.'One year ago,Iran took a gambleand started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostagesA year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won’t back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He’s that worried.ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANONYou can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first isrestoring Israel’s securityand carrying out the military destruction of Iran’s terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.Israeli soldiers raise their fists from a moving APC in northern Israel on Tuesday, Oct. 1.(AP/Baz Ratner)Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.Iran couldn’t stand it.Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.Heavy smoke billows from an Israeli airstrike on an area between the Lebanese southern border villages of Kfarkela and Aadaysit Marjaayoun on Oct. 2.(Stringer/dpa via Getty Images)Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah,according tothe Wall Street Journal.The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel’s missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel’s multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.Officers of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significantbreach of Israel’s borderssince the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during the Friday Prayers and a commemoration ceremony of late Lebanon's Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Tehran, Iran, on Oct. 4.(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/West Asia News Agency/Reuters)And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn’t ready.Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.Israel’s systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah’s leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel’s strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran’s power may be required.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONDespite Israel’s military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran’s missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn’t, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can’t go on forever (although China would like it).The path ahead depends on restoring Israel’s security and taking out Iran’s capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It’s not easy – the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.And it’s important for Americans to stay committed to Israel’s security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by theshock unleashing of antisemitism.Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above.

(Video: IDF Spokesman's Unit)JERUSALEM – Even as Israeli forces continue to battleHamas terroristsinside the Gaza Strip, tensions appear to be rising on Israel’s northern border as the Iranian-backed Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon ramped up its rocket fire and Israel responded, hitting military targets and killing one of its top, elite commanders.Despite efforts by U.S. and French mediators to negotiate a solution that would prevent another major conflict breaking out in the region, the odds of a second war for Israel, against another Iranian proxy, seem to be drawing closer.""I do believe that Hezbollah is interested in a war and it is doing everything it can to drive Israel into a war,"" Sarit Zehavi, founder and president of the Alma Education and Research Center, which is located on Israel’s northern border and focuses on the security challenges there, told Fox News Digital.""Hezbollah has created a situation in the northern part of Israel that is unbearable for Israelis and unbearable for the State of Israel,"" she said.

""It’s not a full-scale war yet, because neither side is using its full capabilities, but every day we are seeing rockets launched into Israel.""While Hezbollah’s rocket, missile and armed drone attacks have been ongoing since Oct. 7, when thousands of Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip infiltrated southern Israel, murdering more 1,200 people and taking a further 240 as hostages, over the past week the number of attacks have escalated and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has responded, hitting an increasing number of sites across southern Lebanon.The scene of a Hezbollah strike in the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, where a woman and her 15-year-old son were injured during a Hezbollah rocket barrage on Feb. 13, 2024.(Erez Ben Simon/TPS)Last week, a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanese territory scored a direct hit on the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona, seriously injuring a woman and her son. The following day, Feb. 14, Hezbollah targeted an army base deeper inside Israel, killing one IDF soldier and wounding several others.In response, Israeli fighter jets struck what the army described as military targets – observation posts, weapons storage facilities and compounds – it said belonged to Hezbollah. On Wednesday, Israel said it killed a commander and six fighters fromHezbollah’s elite Radwanunit and local media reported that the strike killed at least 10 civilians in the area as well. Israel named the Radwan commander as Ali Muhammad Aldbas.IRANIAN PROXIES STEPPING UP THEIR DRONE ATTACKS IN WAR WITH ISRAELIsraeli military forces near the Lebanese border on Feb. 14, 2024.(Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS)Earlier in the week, France, Lebanon’s former sovereign, announced that it had delivered a written proposal to the Lebanese government aimed at ending the hostilities with Israel. According to media reports, the French proposal calls for Hezbollah and any other militant groups based in southern Lebanon to withdraw 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Israel.U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein, who in 2022 successfully mediated an agreement between Israel and Lebanon on a decades-old maritime border dispute, has also been engaged in finding a peaceful solution that would prevent an additional, perhaps more intense and far broader regional war. Reports suggest that his proposal also involves some kind of security zone along the border.United Nations peacekeeping forces drive along the main road leading to Lebanon's southern town of Naqura, close to the border with Israel on Oct. 27, 2022.(Mahmoud Zayyat/AFP/Getty Images)Israelis, however, are not optimistic about such proposals, particularly if they do not include a complete return and greater enforcement of the conditions laid out inU.N. Security Council Resolution 1701. Reached following the 2006 war between the two countries, Resolution 1701 involves Hezbollah pulling back to beyond the Litani River, some 25 kilometers inside Lebanon, and the placement of either multinational U.N. forces or the Lebanese military along the border to enforce it.On Tuesday, Hezbollah chiefHassan Nasrallahdisparaged any peaceful solutions, saying in a televised address that his group would only stop its cross-border attacks on northern Israel ""when the shooting stops in Gaza,"" Reuters reported.

""Withdrawal for Hezbollah is meaningless. They are not an external army that took over the area, their fighters live there, so how can they withdraw from an area they live in? They are entrenched in the villages and their rockets are hidden inside their homes. I want to see trucks loaded with these munitions leaving the area, but will that happen? I don’t think so.""David Daoud, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a D.C.-based think tank, said war between Israel and Hezbollah was ""inevitable"" and the only question was ""when it will occur – now or at some indefinite point in the future.""Lebanon's Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, gives a televised address at a memorial ceremony to mark one week since the passing of Mohammad Yaghi, one of the powerful armed group's figures, in Baalbek, Lebanon Jan. 5, 2024.(Reuters/Mohamed Azakir)""I don’t think either side intends to go to war, each for their own considerations,"" he said. ""Hezbollah is fighting from within a Lebanon experiencing economic collapse, political deadlock, and lack of foreign funding, and it has more to lose by launching a war than by just continuing its ongoing attacks at their current level.""Daoud said continuing with its current level of intensity ""has a massive impact on Israel but does not give Israel international legitimacy for a broader military operation against Lebanon.""He also said efforts to mediate a more peaceful solution, to include removing Hezbollah from along Israel’s border, were ""doomed to fail"" because there was no way to guarantee that Hezbollah would stay out of south Lebanon for good.IRAN SETS MIDEAST ON FIRE AS CRITICS SAY BIDEN POLICIES FAILED: 'FURTHER RECKLESSNESS'Hezbollah fighters attend a memorial for their slain leader, Sheik Abbas al-Mousawi, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in 1992, in south Lebanon, on Feb. 13, 2016.(AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari, File)""All the diplomatic deals on the table depend upon the Lebanese State, the Lebanese Armed Forces, and UNIFIL to prevent Hezbollah’s return,"" Daoud said. ""But even the presence of forces there won’t make a difference, because Lebanon has made clear it is unwilling or unable to rein in Hezbollah.""He highlighted a recent interview with Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib, who said trying to restrain or disarm Hezbollah, which has sizeable support in the country, would mean civil war for Lebanon, whereas leaving Hezbollah armed risked regional war. He said his personal preference between the two choices was a regional war.""The U.S. is hugely motivated to prevent a war from happening between Israel and Lebanon, especially because war is not part of Biden’s ideology and because he understands that a war with Hezbollah really means a war with Iran,"" said Dr. Eyal Pinko, a senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv.However, he said that as Hamas, which is alsobacked by Iran, continues to be destroyed by Israeli forces in Gaza, the more Iran will pressure Hezbollah to attack Israel from the north.""I don’t believe that Hezbollah wants a war, its position in Lebanon is very bad,"" said Pinko, a retired Navy commander who served in the Israeli navy and intelligence agency for 30 years.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is at war.,"October 7, 2023",2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"FOX News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst joined ‘Cavuto Live’ to report on the latest news emerging from Israel as the country declares war.Sabbath tranquility in Israelwas ruptured on Oct. 7, marking the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and 43 years to the day that Egypt’s president Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Muslim Brotherhood terrorists.Early on Saturday morning Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets upon Israel, reaching as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.This audacious attack shines a glaring spotlight on the failures of the Biden administration’s foreign policy, the unholy alliance between Iran and Hamas, and the global implications that reach as far as Beijing.AT LEAST 100 DEAD AS HAMAS LAUNCHES UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON ISRAEL, NETANYAHU SAYS NATION IS 'AT WAR'Let’s look at all the pieces on the global chessboard and what it means for the U.S. under Biden’s leadership going forward.Police officers evacuate a woman and a child from a site hit by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, in Ashkelon, southern Israel, Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023. (AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov)The Unholy Alliance: Iran and HamasIran's support for Hamasis not a secret. What’s alarming is the extent to which this alliance has been fueled by the Biden administration’s billions in aid to Iran. Despite the theological divide between Iran’s Shiite theocracy and Hamas’ radical Sunni ideology, their common goal of annihilating Israel unites them.Israel faces a grueling struggle ahead, fighting on multiple fronts while facing international scrutiny.Look for Iran to bring in its most powerful proxy in the region,Lebanon’s Hezbollah,with an arsenal of some 100,000 rockets aimed at Israel.The Hostage Crisis: A Calculated MoveHamas has escalated the conflict by taking Israeli hostages, likely confined in fortified bunkers. Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu has responded with full military mobilization. The recovery of these hostages will be a long, costly endeavor, potentially involving thousands of casualties.The Palestinian Power Vacuum: West Bank in the BalanceAs if the situation weren't volatile enough, Hamas is likely making a play to unseat the geriatricPalestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas. Should it succeed, a new front will open in the historic Jewish lands of Judea and Samaria, complicating Israel’s military calculus.ISRAELI PM NETANYAHU DECLARES 'WAR AFTER HAMAS TERRORISTS LAUNCH MASSIVE ATTACK: LIVE UPDATESThe ""Proportionality"" Trap: International ScrutinyIsrael, while defending its very existence, will be subject to calls for ""proportional"" response from the international community. It’s a twisted irony that Israel is expected to moderate its self-defense while under indiscriminate attack.Biden’s Track Record: A Litany of FailuresThe Biden administration’s foreign policy failureshave had a profound impact since the president took office. From the disastrous withdrawal from Kabul to the lack of deterrence against Russian aggression in Ukraine, the U.S. has displayed glaring weaknesses. Adding insult to injury, recent reports suggest that Iran has successfully placed agents of influence within the Biden administration. This is not just a breach of national security; it’s a chilling testament to the level of Tehran’s ambitions and a direct contributor to the emboldening of Iran and its proxies like Hamas.The Saving Grace: The Abraham AccordsIsrael finds itself in a precarious situation, but it would be in even greater difficulty were it not for the Abraham Accords. Orchestrated by theTrump administration, this visionary diplomatic effort normalized relations between Israel and several Muslim nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThese agreements have created a strategic realignment in the region,providing Israel with a broader coalitionof nations that share an interest in curbing Iranian aggression and fostering stability. While the Abraham Accords may not directly mitigate the immediate crisis, they offer a long-term framework that isolates malign actors like Iran and Hamas, giving Israel strategic depth and diplomatic leverage it didn’t have before.Beijing Watches: The Taiwan ConnectionAs the crisis unfolds,Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinpingis observing America's response closely. Any sign of American indecisiveness or weakness will be analyzed as a factor in China’s own geopolitical calculations, particularly concerning Taiwan. In a world increasingly defined by great power competition, how America responds to the Israel-Hamas crisis will resonate far beyond the Middle East.The Road Ahead: High Stakes, Higher CostsIsrael faces a grueling struggle ahead, fighting on multiple fronts while facing international scrutiny.Hamas,emboldened by Iranian supportand American weakness, will continue its assaults. The potential collapse of the Palestinian Authority adds yet another layer of complexity.In this global chessboard of high stakes, the ripples of weak leadership can spread, affecting alliances, emboldening enemies, and altering the geopolitical landscape.Cars are on fire after they were hit by rockets from the Gaza Strip in Ashkelon, Israel, on Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023.(AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmerica must urgently recalibrate its foreign policy, purge its administration of foreign influence, and stand firmly with its allies.If it fails to do so, the consequences will reverberate far beyond the borders of Israel, impacting the power dynamics of a world already teetering on the edge.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHUCK DEVOREChuck DeVore is a vice president with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, was elected to the California legislature, is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, and the author of the new book, ""Crisis of the House Never United.""Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

It was swiftly rejected Friday by Palestinian leaders and runs counter to Washington's vision for the war-ravaged enclave.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahupresented the two-page document to his security Cabinet late Thursday for approval.Deep disagreements over Gaza's future have led to increasingly public friction between Israel and the United States, its closest ally. The Biden administration seeks eventual Palestinian governance in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank as a precursor to Palestinian statehood, an outcome vehemently opposed by Netanyahu and his right-wing government. Netanyahu's plan envisions hand-picked Palestinians in Gaza administering the territory.BIDEN TO GO TO UN SECURITY COUNCIL TO FORCE TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE ON ISRAEL, HALT RAFAH OFFENSIVESeparately, cease-fire efforts appeared to gain traction, with mediators to present a new proposal at an expected high-level meeting this weekend in Paris. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have been struggling for weeks to find a formula that could halt Israel’s devastating offensive in Gaza, but now face an unofficial deadline as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches.In Gaza,Israeli airstrikesin the center and south of the territory killed at least 68 Palestinians, including children and women, overnight and into Friday, health officials and an Associated Press journalist said.

At a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, relatives wept over bodies laid out in burial shrouds in the courtyard, and a man cradled a dead infant.The overall Palestinian death toll since the start of the war rose to more than 29,500, with close to 70,000 people wounded, Gaza health officials said. The death toll amounts to close to 1.3% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million.A masked man holding a gun walks with others after two men were killed in an Israeli drone strike in the West Bank. The photo was taken on Friday, Feb. 23, 2024.(AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed)Netanyahu's plan, while lacking specifics, marks the first time he has presented a formal postwar vision. It reiterates that Israel is determined to crush Hamas, the militant group that overran the Gaza Strip in 2007.Polls have indicated that a majority of Palestinians don’t support Hamas, but the group has deep roots in Palestinian society. Critics, including some in Israel, say the goal of eliminating Hamas is unattainable.Netanyahu's plan calls for freedom of action for Israel’s military across ademilitarized Gazaafter the war to thwart any security threat. It says Israel would establish a buffer zone inside Gaza, which is likely to provoke U.S. objections.The plan also envisions Gaza being governed by local officials who it says would ""not be identified with countries or entities that support terrorism and will not receive payment from them.""It’s not clear if any Palestinians would agree to such sub-contractor roles. Over the past decades, Israel has repeatedly tried and failed to set up hand-picked local Palestinian governing bodies.The Palestinian Authority, which administers pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Friday denounced Netanyahu's plan as ""colonialist and racist,"" saying it would amount to Israeli reoccupation of Gaza. Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but maintained control of access to the territory.The Biden administration wants to see a reformed Palestinian Authority govern both Gaza and the West Bank as a step toward Palestinian statehood. It has sought to chip away at Netanyahu's resistance by holding out the prospect of the normalization of ties between Israel and Arab powerhouse Saudi Arabia.Israel declared war on Hamas on Oct. 7, after the militants stormed into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. More than 100 hostages were freed in a weeklong cease-fire in late November.Since the start of the war, 29,514 Palestinians were killed in Israel's offensive and close to 70,000 were wounded, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday. Two-thirds of those killed have been women and children, said the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.Israel says it has killed at least 10,000 Hamas fighters, without presenting details. It holds Hamas responsible for civilian casualties because the group operates and fights from within civilian areas. The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to do more to avoid harm to civilians, but the daily number of deaths reported in Gaza appears to be relatively constant.The Israeli offensive has inflicted immense suffering in Gaza. About 80% of the population have been displaced, infectious diseases run rampant and hundreds of thousands of people are facing hunger.In the West Bank, two Palestinians killed in an Israeli drone strike on their car were buried Friday in the Jenin refugee camp.

Yaakov Amidror, a Distinguished Fellow at JINSA's Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy discusses Israel's readiness in case of war with terror group Hezbollah.JERUSALEM – Retired Gen. Yaakov Amidror, the former national security adviser to Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu, discussed with Fox News Digital the likelihood of an imminent full-blown war between the Jewish state and the Lebanon-based terrorist movement Hezbollah.The Shiite Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah, which is the de facto ruler of Lebanon, according to experts on the country, fired some 50 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday. Shrapnel from a Hezbollah anti-tank missile hit an American citizen and two Israelis. The 31-year-old American is in critical condition. Since last week, Hezbollah has launched over 200 rockets and drones into Israel’s north.""We don't expect the Americans to fight for us. That should be done by Israelis. This is a principle that we don't want to change. What we need is American support by sending munitions of all kinds, and to do it in very high number, in a constant flow that will allow us to do the war with our constraints in our military and capabilities,"" Amidror, a distinguished fellow for the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA,) told Fox News Digital.AMERICAN WOUNDED IN HEZBOLLAH ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAELTzipi Livni, Israel's chief negotiator with the Palestinians, left, with, from left, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Yaakov Amidror and Maj.

He said the real question is if ""Israel has enough to wage a war against Hezbollah in full. For that, the answer is yes. The more time that we will have after the war in Gaza, the better our situation will be, because we have to fulfill our stores and let the soldiers and the commanders rest, after nine months of war.""Hezbollah’s ally, Hamas, invaded Israel on Oct. 7 and massacred nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 American citizens.

The first is the ""huge number of rockets and missiles."" He said many ""are very precise. And this is a bigger threat for Israel."" The second threat, he says, is ""the anti-tank capability of Hezbollah, which launched more than 1,000 anti-tank missiles into Israel since the beginning of the war. It's a huge threat to our ground forces."" The third threat, he said, is drones. ""We don't have a full answer for that.

He believes Israel should concentrate on Hezbollah and not the Lebanese state, noting that if a peace process is to happen it should be done ""by weakening Hezbollah and not weakening the Lebanese system.""The key Hezbollah stronghold is in south Beirut. Amidror stressed how Hezbollah uses civilian buildings as rocket launchers and storage for its armaments. Hamas and Hezbollah frequently commit war crimes by exploiting their civilian populations to advance their war goals.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-advanced-military-technology-full-display-during-iran-attack,Israel’s advanced military technology on full display during Iran's attack,Iran’s first-ever missile attack on Israel from its own soil brought together all different tiers of Israel’s aerial defense system and showed its technological superiority.,April 17,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari discusses Iran's attack on Israel, saying the attacks proved that Iran seeks to ""escalate the region.""JERUSALEM — Some of Israel’s most advanced military technology was on display over the weekend when its multi-level aerial defense array led the way in striking down an estimated 99% of the more than 350 drones, rockets and missiles that were fired by Iran in an unprecedented attack on the Jewish state.From the Iron Dome, which in its latest format usesartificial intelligence (AI)to improve accuracy when shooting short-range surface-to-surface rockets, to David’s Sling, which intercepts short- to medium-range and medium- to long-range surface-to-surface missiles, to the Arrow 2 and 3 systems, which is used for longer-range ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as AI-driven aircraft and other technology, Israel’s defensive operation proved it was far superior to the offensive capabilities of the Islamic Republic.In a press briefing following the attack, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari hailed Israel’s defensive operation, which was carried out together with partners from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), as a ""very significant strategic achievement."" He said it demonstrated the ""exceptional professionalism"" of Israel’s Aerial Defense Array and the ""defensive abilities of the air force as well as the army’s military and technological superiority.""BATTLEFIELD DEMANDS SPARK AI RACE IN UKRAINE AS WAR WITH RUSSIA RAGES ONTal Mimran, of the Cyber Security Research Center in the Faculty of Law at Hebrew University, told Fox News Digital that broader cyber methods and even AI technology were also likely used in the successful defense operation.""AI-powered algorithms analyze radar and other sensor data to track incoming missiles and calculate the best time to intercept these more effectively and prioritize targets,"" he said. ""AI makes the system more effective against a wider range of threats, like drones and other small, low-flying objects.""Mimran saidthe Iron Dome, which Israel has been using for more than a decade to thwart rocket attacks from Gaza and Lebanon, now uses a ""significant application of AI to improve system accuracy.""""Using AI increases the Iron Dome’s success rate to over 90% and reduces operating costs,"" he said. ""This is important because these threats are becoming increasingly common and pose a challenge to traditional air defense systems, as is evident in the Russia-Ukraine war.""Rockets fired by Hamas terrorists from Gaza City are intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome defense missile system in the early hours of Oct. 8, 2023.(Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images)Mimran also noted that over the past few months ""IDF officials have acknowledged using AI-based tools for several purposes, including targeting support, intelligence analysis, proactive forecasting and streamlined command and control.""According to Mimran, Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has spotlighted the IDF’s Habsora, or ""the Gospel,"" an AI-based system that is used to generate possible military targets for attack. However, he said, accusations that the IDF has been using AI systems to commit mass assassinations give too much credit to the AI-powered tools currently in use.Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, played down the role of AI in the weekend operation, telling Fox News Digital that while the technology is incorporated in some air force systems, ""a live event with 300 incoming projectiles cannot be left to AI; there needs to be responsible human in the loop making real-time decisions.""ISRAEL'S USE OF AI IN HAMAS WAR CAN HELP LIMIT COLLATERAL DAMAGE 'IF EXECUTED PROPERLY,' EXPERT SAYSDozens of Israeli Air Force planes were deployed to intercept UAVs and cruise missiles launched from Iran over the weekend.(IDF Spokesman's Unit)""I know that senior air force personnel were involved in controlling every aspect of this,"" said Conricus, a former IDF spokesperson for the international media. ""I find it hard to believe that any significant part of the targeting done [over the weekend] was done with AI.""He said that over the past six months – since Oct. 7 when thePalestinian terror group Hamascarried out a brutal attack in southern Israel, sparking a full-blown war in Gaza and daily rocket fire by the militant Shiite terror group Hezbollah across Israel’s northern border, too – Israel has been forced to utilize its innovative missile defense technology.""All of the systems have been fully operational since Oct. 7 and all have confirmed real-world hits,"" Conricus said, adding that Israel’s newest layer of aerial defense, the Arrow 3 system, debuted just a few months ago by intercepting ballistic missiles fired by the Yemen-based Houthis, an extremist Islamist group that is supported and funded by the fundamentalist Islamist regime in Tehran. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are also Iranian proxies.Israeli defense systems intercept an Iranian missile over Maale Adumim, near Jerusalem, in the early hours of April 14, 2024.(Matanya Reichman/TPS)""I think that today what we have is a pretty solid and well-rounded air defense that deals with a very wide array and broad spectrum of incoming threats, from very small and fast projectiles like UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) to extremely large and lethal ballistic missiles, which are also very fast, tremendously big and carry a ton of explosives,"" he said.Iran’s attack on Sunday – the first ever directly from its soil – brought together all the different tiers of Israel’s defensive system, Conricus said.""They are all interlinked and communicate with each other,"" he said, describing how a central command office provided an overall picture of the attack as it unfolded, giving a threat assessment in real time and coordinating the entire operation with the U.S. and other CENTCOM partners.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?Iron Dome and other sophisticated military tech help to bring down 99% of Iran's missiles and drones. (Getty Images.)Conricus said that while many of the innovative defense systems were created by Israel, ""a large part of the development was also carried out with the Americans,"" allowing ""the radar systems and the digital intercepting systems"" to communicate with U.S. defense systems.""""They were developed together with congressional funding and support,"" he said, explaining that there were ""a lot of plug-and-play capabilities"" and, if needed, the U.S. systems can easily connect with the Israeli system.According to Israeli army estimates, Iran fired some 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles and 170 suicide drones that carried about 60 tons of warheads and explosives combined. While most of the projectiles were shot down before reaching Israel’s borders, two air force bases were lightly hit and a 7-year-old Israeli girl was seriously injured. Forces from theU.S., British and French militaries, as well as from several countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, participated in the operation.""To coordinate such an attack is not an easy task because all three weapon systems have [different] velocities and performances,"" said Tal Inbar, a senior research fellow at Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.He said that the UAVs, mostly Iranian-produced Shahed 136s, would have been fired first because they move at the slowest pace; followed by the cruise missiles and finally the ballistic missiles, which have a relatively short flight time from Iran to Israel, depending on the launch site.U.S. CENTCOM Gen. Michael Kurilla, left, meets with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant amid rising tensions with Iran.(Ariel Hermoni/IMoD/File)Inbar noted that Iran’s decision to use drones gave Israel several hours to ""prepare itself to the maximum.""In addition to deploying advanced missile defense systems and scrambling fighter planes, he said Israel also put in place some levels of cyberprotection, including disrupting satellite navigation, which is effective in stopping some of the projectiles from reaching their targets.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Ballistic missiles cannot be jammed because they use an internal navigation system, but this is not the case with drones,"" Inbar said, noting that Israelis have become used to GPS disturbances over the past six months.Recentmedia reportsalso suggest that Israel deployed its new $1 billion spy plane, the Oron, which provided vital information that was used to track and destroy the drones and missiles in flight. The high-tech jet, which Israel unveiled at last year’s Paris Air Show, is equipped with thousands of advanced sensors. The Oron has the ability to scan vast terrain and gather an unprecedented amount of information at a considerable distance from the targets being tracked.

I've seen Hamas horrors and it hit me very hard,It has been one week since the world witnessed the horrors of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.

I have always dreamt of being a journalist and am one of the fortunate ones who do what they love most. And while I cannot imagine myself doing anything else, I have realized in past years what a huge toll it has on my life.The most disturbing thing I have seen, since the Hamas attacks of October 7, is too horrible to describe and share here. In the past week, I have seen the most awful things that can be done to people of all ages—babies, older women, young teens -- scenes that I will never forget.Yonat Friling is a Sr. Field Producer for Fox News Media based in the Jerusalem Bureau.I have lost friends and colleagues in this round of terror attacks, too. Like most people in Israel since the attacks on Saturday morning, October 7, we either know someone who was murdered, kidnapped or currently fighting Hamas. This touches almost every household here.The army’s presence here in Israel during conflict times is familiar, and we work well with them and are able to bring the stories of the people here.ISRAELI SHELLING AT LEBANON BORDER KILLS REUTERS VIDEOGRAPHER AND INJURES JOURNALISTSThere are 70,000 living near theIsrael-Gaza border area, and in less than 24 hours, more than 1,000 of them have been slaughtered. Families seeking shelters on a sunny Saturday morning were killed; in some places, they barricaded themselves for 10 to 16 hours with no electricity or water, with only the clothes they had. They heard the Hamas militants' footsteps and their conversations in their homes. Each story we hear is more unfathomable than the other, more disturbing.The scene in Israel since theHamas attacksis grim. Most of the towns and communities are empty. The streets are silent, shops are closed, and there are no people are walking around. There is a heavy army and police presence, and the smoke from the rockets and the airstrikes fills the air.In the communities that were closest to the border, the houses of Israelis living there have been torched, and there's no resemblance to the vibrant lifestyle that was there just a few days ago.I have covered many wars and conflicts here in Israel, but this is the hardest one I have encountered so far; I am at a loss for words to describe what I feel, and frankly, I haven't had the time to do so.Members of Yonat Friling's team covering the aftermath of the Hamas attacks in Israel in October.One of the most amazing things is that the people of Israel were shocked, but right after, they bounced back, organized blood drives and food deliveries, and opened their homes and hearts to people they have never met, so there's a little comfort in these humbling scenes.On October 10, around the globe, we observedWorld Mental Health Day.I have covered many wars and conflicts here in Israel, but this is the hardest one I have encountered so far; I am at a loss for words to describe what I feel, and frankly, I haven't had the time to do so.It takes courage to admit your flaws and vulnerability.

Like the police, the fire and medical services, military personnel, and rescue workers, journalists are professional first responders to crises and disasters. But we are often among the last of those groups to recognize the psychological implications.Apart from the journalists in the field, there are those in the newsrooms -- who may be subjected tovicarious traumawhen repeatedly exposed to distressing images and experiences, even if they are not on the scene.When covering such events, we must act responsibly toward our viewers.

Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility—especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks.

Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.FORMER JETS QUARTERBACK REVISITS AWKWARD HUG BETWEEN ROBERT SALEH, ARRON RODGERS AFTER FIRINGNew York Jets owner Woody Johnson looks on before a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Acrisure Stadium on October 2, 2022 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.(Joe Sargent/Getty Images)""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-proxies-stepping-drone-attacks-war-israel,Iranian proxies stepping up their drone attacks in war with Israel,"Considered one of the world’s leaders in producing and using high-quality drones, Israel failed to prevent Hamas’ effective use of drones in the initial stages of its deadly Oct. 7 attack.",January 12,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"FOX News' Trey Yingst reports the latest from southern Israel.JERUSALEM – Beginning Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists used remote controlled drones to disarm tanks and knock out surveillance cameras during its surprise attack on Israel, through to last week, when a Hezbollah drone from Lebanon landed directly in an army base innorthern Israel, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming part of the weapons arsenal used by Iranian-backed non-state players in their war against the Jewish state.While Israel has in place what it calls ""an aerial defense array"" – used multiple times over the past three months to thwart ""hostile aircraft"" from Gaza and Lebanon – as UAVs become easier to obtain, manufacture, enhance and weaponize, Israel, as well as other countries around the world, are racing to contend with an ever more lethal form of combat that is already outpacing existing military defense systems.""The Israeli – and the U.S. – militaries have been using drones for a long time, especially in counterterrorism, for intelligence gathering or for precision strikes in order to distinguish between civilians and fighters,"" Dr. Liran Antebi, program director of advanced technologies and national security at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital.US IMPOSES NEW ROUND OF SANCTIONS ON NETWORK INVOLVED IN IRAN’S DRONE PRODUCTIONXtend’s Griffon Counter UAVs, with speeds of up to 93.1 miles per hour, and AI technology are being used by the IDF to identify and kill rogue drones. (Extend.)(Xtend)""However, what was once the silver bullet used by democracies in counterterrorism and to act in more ethical ways, is now in thehands of terroristsor non-democratic states and is being used in the opposite way,"" she said.According to Antebi, ISIS was already a huge fan of UAVs when it waged jihad in Iraq and Syria a decade ago. Now, more sophisticated, and much more lethal armed drones, are taking center stage in global conflicts, most recently in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war. In some cases, Russian soldiers have used military grade UAVs, including thosecreated by Iran, to strike right in the heart of civilian populations.In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently declared a plan to produce a million drones this year to fight back against Russia. And Russia, according to reports, is also increasing its drone stocks, including stepping up purchase of the Iranian-designed Shahed 136 suicide drone, a move that could have direct impact and increase the capabilities of groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the Houthi terror group in Yemen, which is also considered a proxy of Tehran.""While Israel is considered one of the world’s leaders in producing and using high-quality drones and UAVs, as well as a leading country in the field of counter systems to fight against those technologies, it has not been very effective at implementing those defense mechanisms,"" Antebi said, using Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack as an example.IRAN PRAISES HOUTHI PROXY GROUP RAIDING US MILITARY ASSETS, ISRAEL: 'SUPPORT TO THE RESISTANCE FRONT'Firefighters help a local woman evacuate from a residential building destroyed by a Russian drone strike, which local authorities consider to be Iranian-made Shahed-136, in Kyiv, Oct. 17, 2022.(Reuters/Vladyslav Musiienko)She said that since the start of the current Gaza war, Hamas, Hezbollah and even the Houthis, had used all manner of UAVs to strike Israel, ranging from enhanced ""off-the-shelf"" drones to more sophisticated military-grade UAVs, capable of dropping bombs or of self-exploding.""What we have not seen yet in our arena are the larger UAVs capable of launching missiles, which we know Iran is already producing,"" Antebi said. ""We also haven't seen any FPV (first person view) drones yet, which we also know are being used in Ukraine.""Unlike ordinary drones, which are operated using a mobile phone or tablet and can be easily tracked using existing defensive technology, FPVs are operated with VR goggles and are much more difficult to detect and intercept.Tal Mimran, from the Cyber Security Research Center in the Faculty of Law at Hebrew University, told Fox News Digital, that the use of armed drones, even the simplest ones, by non-state actors was a game-changer for Israel – as well as for other Western democracies with conventional armies bound by international law.""When we think of an army like the U.S., Israel, the U.K., a drone is a technical weapon that is used alongside more significant tools such as airplanes or helicopters, but when it comes to a weaker state, and specifically non-state actors, it is a strategic change,"" he said, adding that Iran’s training of terror groups in the art of drone warfare was ""closing the gap between Israel and rogue groups such as Hamas or Hezbollah.""ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: IDF UNCOVERS EVIDENCE OF HAMAS DEVELOPING PRECISION MISSILE CAPABILITIES WITH IRAN'S HELPHouthi security troops ride a vehicle after guarding a gathering for an address by the group's leader inside Al-Sha'ab Mosque on Nov. 14, 2023 in Sana'a, Yemen.(Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images)While Israel has in place a multibillion-dollar rocket and missile air defense system designed to respond to attacks on multiple fronts and which can easily take down the relatively crude rockets lobbed by Hamas, the midrange rockets and missiles possessed by Hezbollah and even the longer-range ballistic missiles fired in recent weeks by the Houthis from Yemen, smaller, more nimble threats from armed or exploding drones are still a challenge.""Israel deals very well with a missile spread and the Iron Dome can intercept some of the drones,"" said Mimran. ""But there is no doubt this is a game changer.""Already, the situation appears to be changing. Earlier this month, for the first time, the Israeli army said that it used an advanced drone in a precision strike against a Hamas target inside Gaza. Until now, Mimran said the military had refrained from using offensive drones to fight Hamas, even though they had been used on the northern front, in Lebanon and Syria. But that approach might change if the northern front opens up.Iran showed video of a Shahed drone in flight, Feb. 24, 2023.(IRINN via AP)""We might see new things that we haven't seen until now,"" said Mimran, referring to Israel’s capability of sending a ""swarm of drones"" with technology developed by Israeli defense company Elbit. It is also very possible, he added, that Hezbollah too has the capacity of sending hundreds, if not thousands, of drones at one time ""creating chaos like we have never seen before in these parts.""Aviv Shapira, co-founder and CEO of Xtend, a company developing drones for the defense market, said it was just a matter of time before the threat of drones became global.HEZBOLLAH CLAIMS IT DOESN'T WANT EXPANDED WAR WITH ISRAEL AFTER LAUNCHING DRONE ATTACK ON ISRAELI ARMY BASERockets are fired toward Israel from the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, Oct. 23, 2023.(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)""It will happen all over the world and right now, no one knows how to deal with it,"" said Shapira, whose company began developing racing drones for the gaming industry but was soon commissioned formilitary purposes. ""In the U.S. there are so many anti-terror measures in place, but now it is possible for anyone to suddenly take a drone, without a radio [and therefore not trackable] and use it in an attack.""He said that until now, defense companies were focused on developing advanced cyber measures to counter armed drones, but as tethered or pre-programmed UAVs become more common, there was a need for a new type of defense systems.""The problem is that you don’t know where these drones are coming from because they are so small and they cannot be stopped with jamming devices,"" said Shapira, whose company worked with the Israeli army to tackle the previous Hamas threat of incendiary balloons and kites that were causing havoc a few years ago.IRAN, RUSSIA, SLAM US-UK JOINT STRIKES ON YEMEN’S HOUTHIS, WARN OF ‘INSTABILITY IN THE REGION’Smoke rises after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip hit a house in Ashkelon, southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.(AP)""These drones don’t have radio communications, so the only way to mitigate this problem is to physically intercept them,"" he said. ""That means either shooting them down, using laser or technology like we have developed, which involves a high-speed drone that catches other drones with a net""According to Shapira, Xtend’s Griffon Counter UAV, with speeds of up to 93 mph, flies faster than any other drone currently available and can be programmed to operate autonomously, using AI, to identify a ""rogue drone and kill it.""And, he added, the technology is so simple to use that it does not require a soldier or extensive training, but anyone can learn to operate it in less than 30 minutes.However, Antebi, who is also a researcher of advanced technologies in warfare, warned that the development of all new technologies – defensive or offensive – ran the risk of having a ""boomerang effect.""""There are a lot of startups and technology companies creating amazing technologies that can change the world for good, but we also have to be aware that the bad guys also want to use those technologies and they are capable of using them for bad,"" she said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAn Iranian military truck carries surface-to-air missiles past a portrait of Iran's supreme leader during a parade on April 18, 2018, in Tehran.(Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images)For Mimran, a broader concern, particularly in terms of drone warfare, is that currently there are no international guidelines, regulations or benchmarks.""While there have been some global campaigns aimed at trying to ban the use ofdrones in wars,"" he said. ""The ideological gaps between the West and the rest of the world are becoming so large that there is no way for the international community to sit together and think of appropriate regulation or rules of the game for this kind of weapon.""Ruth Marks Eglash is a veteran journalist based inJerusalem, Israel.

(Mike Drewecki Camera)Anti-Israel demonstrators descendedon Washington, D.C., on Wednesday as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress in a scene that quickly turned chaotic.At least one demonstrator, whose face was covered, was spotted by Fox News carrying what appeared to be the flag of the terrorist group Hamas, while others were heard shouting ""allahu Akbar.""At Union Station, agitators burned an American flag and vandalized a Christopher Columbus statue with the words ""Hamas is coming."" They also took down an American flag and flew the Palestinian flag instead.A man who walked by the statue and remarked that he was Jewish and was offended by the language was then chased down the street and yelled at and called ""Hitler"" by agitators. He and a woman were later let inside a building to get away from the protesters. When a Fox News reporter asked why they followed the man, one said it was because he was White and Jewish.PROTESTERS CHANT ‘FREE PALESTINE’ AS NETANYAHU ADDRESSES CONGRESSThe US Capitol Police later advised, ""No flags under our protection have been removed or vandalized. Our officers will enforce the law if anyone attempts to remove a flag in USCP jurisdiction. To clear up inaccurate reporting.""Union Station, where the American flag was removed, is not on the U.S. Capitol Grounds.Video on social media captured a person who tried to save the American flag as it was being burned at Union Station.  Protesters chased after the man, ripping it away from him, but he proudly displayed a scrap of it in a picture seen later on X.Reacting to a photo of a protester holding a Hamas flag, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote simply on X: ""Terrorists.""Earlier in the day, hundreds of protesters had gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue and 3rd Street, outside the Gallery of Art.

(Video: Reuters)JERUSALEM — WithIsrael on the vergeof a third full-blown war against Hezbollah because of the Lebanese organization’s constant firing of deadly missiles, drones and rockets, the differences and similarities between Hezbollah and Hamas are now under the microscope.The Islamic Republic of Iran finances the Mideast terrorist movements Hamas and Hezbollah, who have declared war on Israel and who are also responsible for committing numerous terrorist attacks against American civilians and military service personnel.Fox News Digital contacted experts for a tale-of-the-tape analysis on Hamas, which is situated in the southern Gaza Strip, and Hezbollah, which is the de facto ruler of the Lebanese state on Israel’s northern border. Israel has fought two wars against Hezbollah, in 1982 and in 2006.""Hezbollah is the crown jewel in the Iranian empire of terror and evil and is by far the most powerful Iranian proxy equipped with nation state capabilities and even with more firepower than several European militaries have today,"" Jonathan Conricus, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former IDF spokesman told Fox News Digital.HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS LAUNCH MASSIVE ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAEL AMID MOUNTING TENSIONSIn this Feb. 13, 2016, file photo, Hezbollah fighters hold flags as they attend the memorial for slain leader Sheik Abbas al-Mousawi, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in 1992, in Tefahta village, south Lebanon.(AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari, File)Despite widespread poverty and economic instability in Iran, the Islamic Republic is also a generous funding source of Hezbollah, providing the Lebanese terrorist organization with over $700 million a year, according to the Israel Defense Forces and theU.S. State Department. Joint military cooperation between Iran’s regime and Hezbollah has been a longstanding feature in Lebanon, Syria and throughout Europe with respect to terrorism and war planning.""In a military comparison, Hezbollah is far more powerful than Hamas across the board in every military metric. In terms of the amount of rockets they have, the range, the accuracy or the payload or size of the warhead, also in terms of the amount of personnel, armed fighters, their training and their equipment,"" Conricus added.Israeli soldiers fire a mobile howitzer in the north of Israel, near the border with Lebanon Jan. 15, 2024.(AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg)Hezbollah has amassed a massive arsenal of an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles that are aimed at the Jewish state. The IDF has degraded Hamas’ supply of 20,000 rockets and missiles since the start of the war. However, Hamas was capable of launching eight rockets from the city of Rafah into Israel two weeks ago. Fox News Digital reported last week that Hezbollah launched over 200 missiles, rockets and drones into Israel.The economics of Hamas and Hezbollah have similarities and differences in the scope of funding and military training from Tehran.""Hezbollah and Hamas are both terror organizations funded mainly by Iran.

They are Shiites, but Jihadi Shiites, made of Lebanese Shia Islamists who have been recruited (and funded) by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, or the Sepah Pasdaran as early as 1980. They were launched by the Islamic Republic in northern Bekaa that year and marched south all the way to the southern suburb of Beirut and then to the south after Israel started to withdraw.""ODDS OF ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH WAR 'INEVITABLE,' EXPERTS FEAR: 'TOTALLY PESSIMISTIC'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF Gibor base in Kiryat Shmona, where he was briefed by 769th Brigade Commander Avraham Marciano and Northern Command Home Front coordinator Brig.-Gen.

Hamas as such is not a ‘nationalist’ group, but a Pan-Islamist organization.""In contrast to Hamas, Phrase noted that Hezbollah believes ""in exactly the doctrine of the Iranian regime. That is to establish a Khomeinist republic in Lebanon to join the sister Islamic Republic in Iran, and also in Iraq and Yemen, and eventually form a ‘parallel’ Shia Khomeinist (Jihadist) type of Caliphate, known as Imamate, Shia Islamists reject the Sunni Caliphate.""Hezbollah Radwan forces training in Southern Lebanon near the Israeli border.(AP/Hassan Ammar)The Islamic revolutionary Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini founded the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, with a mission to export his Shia Islamism across the world.""So, they are at polar opposites ideologically, how did they come together and what is common between them.

That was a major crisis for Hamas, accused by Sunnis of betraying them. But, eventually, when Assad regained ground in Syria, and the Islamic Regime shifted the fight to Gaza, Hamas regained ‘Jihadi notoriety’ in the region.""""Strategically speaking, Hezbollah is currently enjoying a situation where it has Israel exactly where it wants it. And Israel has indeed achieved quite a lot of military achievements. But, on the strategic level, Hezbollah is benefiting from an attrition in Israeli capabilities and from a very challenging diplomatic situation,"" Conricus, the former IDF spokesman, noted.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah speaks via a video link as his supporters raise their hands during the Shiite holy day of Ashoura in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, Aug. 9, 2022.(AP Photo/Hussein Malla)""As long as the international community fails to understand the severity and doesn't act with urgency in order to facilitate a diplomatic deal that will return Israeli civilians to their homes safely, the only other option that remains is the military one, which Israel, unfortunately, will have to use in order to implement the responsibility of any government to safeguard the lives of its civilians. I hope that can be avoided, but currently that does not seem to be the case.""The U.S. has sanctioned both Hamas and Hezbollah as foreign terrorist organizations.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/rising-from-ashes-israelis-nations-war-torn-south-move-home-year-after-oct-7-massacre,Rising from the ashes: Israelis in nation's war-torn south move home a year after October 7 massacre,The unique communal structure of the kibbutz plays a vital role in fostering resilience and support as people heal from the devastating impact of the October 7 massacre with many now returning home.,October 5,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"Fox News' Chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the escalating war from Tel Aviv on 'Special Report.'Before October 7, the communities of the mostly agricultural cooperative settlements, commonly known as kibbutzim, near the Gaza Strip, were considered some of the most picturesque places in Israel, characterized by green fields and carpets of vibrant red anemones. Yet, they were also among the most bombarded areas in the country. ""Ninety-nine percent of the time, it’s paradise; one percent of the time, it’s hell,"" was a common saying among residents.""It’s fair to say this year, we live in that one percent"" Ofer Liberman admits, reflecting on the harsh reality faced by his community. For 22 years, he has served as the spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Am, nestled in the Gaza envelope.On October 7, it was Liberman’s daughter, Inbal, the community’s security coordinator, who displayed remarkable courage. She opened the weapons storage lockers and distributed arms to the community’s rapid response team, sending them to various locations along the kibbutz fence. She and the team engaged in face-to-face battles with Hamas terrorists. Her quick actions prevented them from entering the kibbutz and prevented a massacre similar to what occurred in neighboring communities.ISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS FORCE IS ‘AT WAR’ WITH HAMAS AS IDF HITS BACK AT TERROR TARGETSRuins of burnt out housing on Kibbutz Kissufim after Oct 7, 2023| A sign on a school at Kibbutz Gvulot nearly a year after the terror attacks| fields of Anemones at Kibbutz Nahal Oz.(Efrat Lachter)On Wednesday, during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Liberman celebrated with his family back in Kibbutz Nir Am. ""My wife and I were the only ones to come back in mid-November, while the kibbutz was under full military control. I manage the agriculture in Nir Am, and I had to be here. By the end of March, a small number of families returned, and on August 15, when government funding ended, everyone returned except for 12 families,"" he recounted.""This was a sad holiday; some of our friends still have family members and friends held in Gaza. In the morning, we were informed by the IDF there would be loud noises coming from their fighting in Gaza,"" Liberman described the ongoing tension in the region. ""People got anxious because it reminded them of October 7 — the booming and gunfire. But we’re managing a routine. People go to work, and children go to school, living my life completely, with sounds of war.""A view shows a destroyed home riddled with bullets, following the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip, in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, southern Israel on November 2, 2023.(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo)After October 7, 15,000 people were evacuated from the 21 kibbutzim insouthern Israel,first to hotels and then into temporary housing across the country. Remarkably, about 70% have returned home, a significant achievement considering the ongoing war in Gaza and the devastating impact of the attack, which claimed the lives of some 1,200 people, 319 of whom were kibbutz members, and destroyed hundreds of homes.FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARYHowever, six of the communities where the impact was most severe have yet to return. InKibbutz Be’eri, 98 men, women, and children were murdered, and 30 were kidnapped. In Kfar Aza, home to 700, 64 people, including women and children, were massacred, and 19 were taken hostage.

They’ve been hosting us since October 8,"" Amir Tibon, a resident of Nahal Oz, told Fox News Digital. ""Being together as one community in this temporary housing has been significant, as we are surrounded by the people we love. Our children still go to school and kindergarten together, which makes a big difference.""Israeli army soldiers search the remains of a torched vehicle for forensic evidence at the site of the October 7 attack on the Supernova desert music Festival by Palestinian terrorists near Kibbutz Reim in the Negev desert in southern Israel on October 13, 2023. The rave event had drawn thousands of party-goers from October 6 to the desert site close to Kibbutz Reim, less three miles from the Gaza Strip. But it turned into a horror show early the next day when Hamas militants crossed the border on motorcycles, vans, speed boats or paramotors, launching their surprise offensive on Israel.((Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images))On October 7, Tibon and his wife Miri were rescued along with their two younger daughters, thanks to his mother Gali, and father, retired IDF Major General Noam Tibon, who drove from Tel Aviv to the kibbutz to rescue them.

I saw women and men leading their kibbutzim and prioritizing the mission of returning, even in uncertain times. They decided to focus on the mission of going, working through their emotional states while being part of the teams planning the return. This sense of ownership fosters a deeper sense of belonging than in other places where people feel less influence over future plans.""Tibon reflected on the complexities surrounding the decision to return home. ""This is a conversation we have every day. The issue is about the sense of security that the government and IDF must provide, and overcoming the psychological barriers of returning to a place where such horrors occurred.""Fields of anemones grow in Kibbutz Nahal Oz.

But we still have two friends, Omri and Zachi, in the hands of the enemy,"" Tibon explained. ""For me, going back to the kibbutz means living in a house where a neighbor was killed in the house in front of me, and another neighbor was murdered in the house behind. This is where I will raise my daughters.

""This resulted in the martyrdom of one service member and the injury of 18 others, including civilians. This constitutes a clear hostile act.

Subsequent reporting and intelligence found it was an explosion in the hospital's parking lot stemming from a misfired rocket fired by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas alleged. The initial reports from the Times and others prompted several Arab leaders to cancel meetings with President Biden and sparked riots outside of U.S. and Israeli embassies across the Middle East.While many news organizations uncritically ran with Hamas' narrative, The Times stood out with its blaring headline that read ""Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say"" and even included an unrelated photo of rubble from a bombed building from a separate incident.The following week, The Times published an editor's note admitting it relied ""too heavily"" on Hamas' version of events.The conclusion from Hamas' disinformation campaign drawn by New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg was that ""It Is Impossible to Know What to Believe in This Hideous War.""Former Times reporter Alison Leigh Cowan accused her ex-employer of committing ""modern-day blood libel"" with its erroneous reporting. The Free Press editor Bari Weiss, a former Times opinion page editor, raked the paper over the coals for ""publishing Hamas PR"" and its subsequent ""soft non-apology.""Even after that unflattering episode, the coverage of the war from the ""Paper of Record"" has continued raising eyebrows. While reporting on the Hamas sympathizers who have ripped posters of Israeli hostages in cities and college campuses across the country, The Times described the anti-Israel vandalism as ""its own form of protest- a release valve and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was the Israeli government’s mistreatment of Palestinians in the years before Oct. 7 and since the bombing of Gaza began.""Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst gave an update about the Israel-Hamas warduring an appearanceon ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday.Yingst explained that fighting ""has certainly intensified in southern Gaza,"" specifically in the city of Khan Younis.""It's not just Hamas cells that are fighting the Israelis, but also smaller factions like PFLP and DFP,"" the reporter said. ""The Israelis say over the past several days they've lost 19 soldiers and a number have also been injured in these battles.""""We've seen some of the images released by Hamas and Islamic Jihad showing ambushes against Israeli forces in this area,"" Yingst added.

(Credit: Israel Police Spokesperson’s Unit)When commandos from Israel’s elite Yamam counter-terrorism force launched a daring daytime raid on two homes deep within central Gaza andsuccessfully rescued four hostageswho had forcefully been taken across the border on October 7, it was the first time many people would learn of the unit’s existence.For years, the operations of Yamam have been shrouded in secrecy. Often, credit for its missions was given to other units. ""Up until a few years ago, not many people knew about Yamam’s activities,"" a unit source told Fox News Digital. But in the age of smartphones and social media, videos of their operations have spread online. ""Today, with social media broadcasting operations in real-time, we understand that the rules of the game have changed,"" the source says.Yamam — Yeḥida Merkazit Meyuḥedet, in Hebrew, or Special Central Unit — was founded in 1974 as a special unit of Israel’s Border Police, with the primary mission to take control of and resolve hostage situations. In this regard, it is similar to the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, but because it also is capable of rapid offensive raids, such as the hostage rescue executed in Gaza in June, it is closely aligned with such elite American units as Delta Force and Navy SEALs, with whom they are also said to train and cooperate.ISRAEL RESCUES HOSTAGE AFTER 325 DAYS IN HAMAS CAPTIVITYYamam counter-terrorism unit in action somewhere in Israel.(Israel Police Spokesman's Unit)""Yamam is like an aircraft carrier with a wide range of in-house capabilities,"" said Zohar Dvir, a retired unit commander, told Fox News Digital. The unit includes specialists like snipers, bomb disposal experts, canine handlers, medics and undercover agents known as ""mista'aravim."" ""It’s full on 'Fauda,"" Dvir added.""Yamam equips its personnel with cutting-edge technology,"" David Tzur, a retired commander from the group, told Fox News Digital. ""The unit serves as a testing ground for innovations, collaborating with civilian and defense industries to refine and replicate technologies for broader use.""""What sets Yamam apart is their ability to carry out thousands of high-risk operations with exceptional precision,"" Dvir explained.""Yamam is considered one of the most experienced — if not the most experienced — counter-terrorism units globally,"" a unit commander speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital. ""Because of the realities we face daily, countering terrorist threats in the West Bank, Yamam fighters participate in hundreds of operations each year. After Oct. 7, we joined the fight in Gaza.""Yamam members played a critical role in the recent rescue of four hostages held by Hamas terrorists.(Israel Police Spokesman's Unit)As part of a condition of talking to Fox News Digital all current Yamam members withheld their full names due to security considerations.Intelligence pinpointing the locationof the hostages in the densely populated Nuseirat refugee camp had been gathered weeks earlier by Shin Bet, Israel’s internal intelligence service, with the help of American and British drones. ""We knew about the situation weeks before,"" explains Captain A., a team leader told Fox News Digital. ""We received the mission, studied the target, and began our preparations.""HARRIS' SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN STATE REWARDS TERRORISM, EXPERTS WARNOn a Saturday morning, the operatives arrived in civilian trucks at the target locations, which were just a few hundred meters apart. Storming the two locations, they rescued the four hostages. At the first site, Noa Argamani, whose terrified image was seen worldwide as she was shown being taken away on a motorcycle by terrorists from Israel on the morning of October 7, was found. At the second location, they rescued Shlomi Ziv, Andrey Kozlov and Almog Meir.There was resistance, but ""everything went according to plan,"" said Deputy Superintendent A, a key figure in the operation.Yamam counter-terrorism unit snipers watching out for enemy forces.(Israel Police Spokesman's Unit)The team faced a particularly challenging situation at Argamani’s location, where they feared one of the terrorists was close to her. ""The goal was to get as close to her as quickly as possible, and that’s what we did. We only realized she was alive when A. and D."" — two operatives on the team — ""shouted, ‘We have a diamond! We have a diamond!’ Once we confirmed she was with us, our priority was to get her out safely,"" Sgt.

She was terrified and couldn’t believe what was happening, even when we told her, ‘We’re here to take you home,’"" A. told Fox News Digital.Chief Inspector Arnon Zmora was killed during the raid.(IDF)While Argamani’s rescue went smoothly, the situation at the second apartment was far more complicated. As the team entered, they faced ""very effective"" fire. In the ensuing battle, the team’s commander, Arnon Zmora, was critically injured. ""Everything happened very quickly. It was a matter of seconds,"" recalls Captain A.As with the rescue of Argamani, the team shielded the hostages with their body armor and helmets as they evacuated them under fire. ""The area was like a hornets’ nest, packed with militants inside and outside,"" A. says. ""We quickly moved [the hostages] towards the military vehicles, all the while taking effective fire from within the apartment and its surrounding.""Yamam troops conducting a weekend rescue operation in the Gaza Strip while under heavy fire.(IDF)Though the hostages were rescued unharmed, the end of the mission was tragic for the members of the Yamam team.

""But this is both our privilege and our duty,"" he said. ""We’ll fight until the last soldier, no matter the cost.""""While these operations are heroic, they create the illusion that military pressure alone will free the hostages,"" said Tzur.  ""If there’s an operational window for a rescue, we should take it, but ultimately, we’ll need to make a tough and ugly deal. On October 7th, we were caught off guard, and now we’re forced to negotiate with the devil.

Today, the Palestinian youth and the anti-oppression, anti-occupation movement in Palestine is more energetic, more alive, and more prepared than ever during the past 70 or 80 years. God willing, the movement will achieve its goals.""The ""usurper regime"" is Israel for Khamenei, whose jingoistic foreign policy consists of the destruction of the Jewish state and thefinancing of Palestinians terrorist groupson Israel’s borders.Lior Haiat, the spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, told Fox News Digital on Saturday, ""Those terror organizations [Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad] are working as proxies of the Ayatollah regime "" in the Islamic Republic.AT LEAST 100 DEAD AS HAMAS LAUNCHES UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON ISRAEL, NETANYAHU SAYS NATION IS 'AT WAR'Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Republic of Iran, partners with the Palestenian Hamas terrorist group, are driving the war that was launched against Israel, according to Foreign Ministry and Middle East experts.(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters )Haiat added: ""Iran is trying for years, especially in the last few months, to have a terror organization, both the Islamic Jihad that is fully supported and financed by Iran, and Hamas terror organization that is also financed but not fully by Iran. They are calling them to attack Israel and Israelis.""He stressed that Iran is ""without a doubt . . . behind the scenes"" of this war against Israel.The Iranian regime-controlled Tehran Times reported on Saturday that the Islamic Republic backs the Palestinian Hamas and PIJ war against Israel. According to theTehran Times article, Iran’s Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi declared the war on Israel as  ""glorious"" that has murdered at least 100 Israelis.""We declare our support for this operation, and we are confident that the Resistance Front also supports this move,"" Safavi told attendees at the 6th International Conference of Solidarity with Palestinian Youth. He added that Iran will stand alongside the Palestinian resistance ""until the liberation of Palestine and al-Quds.""Iran’s reference to Palestine means the Jewish state, and al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.The Iran-backedHamas invasion of Israelfollows President Biden’s decision just last month to release $6 billion dollars to Iran as part of a prisoner swap.While the Biden administration said the funds will be supervised by Qatar and not used for terrorism, Iran’s U.S.-sanctioned President Ebrahim Raisi boasted that the money will be used""wherever we need it.""Yigal Carmon, the founder and president of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), predicted the outbreak of the Iran-backed war in a late August article titled""Signs Of Possible War In September-October.""Carmon, a former counter-terrorism adviser to two Israeli Prime Ministers, wrote, ""There has also been an increase in efforts by Iran and Hezbollah to smuggle weapons into the West Bank, similar to the smuggling of weapons into Gaza.""ISRAELI PM NETANYAHU DECLARES 'WAR AFTER HAMAS TERRORISTS LAUNCH MASSIVE ATTACK: LIVE UPDATESRockets into Israel from Gaza Strip(Photos Majdi Fathi/TPS)Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated Lebanese terrorist movement responsible for themass murder of hundreds of Americans.Carmon wrote, ""There have recently been increasing reports about the potential use of new weapons by Hezbollah, Hamas and the PIJ that can cause a large number of Israeli fatalities, such as extra-powerful explosive charges and rockets fired on Israeli localities, as mentioned above. In this situation, Israel will likely be compelled to undertake a large-scale response, above and beyond its routine counter-terrorism measures, even at the cost of an all-out war.""Carmon continued that the Iranian-regime controlled PIJ ""secretary-general Ziad Al-Nakhaleh said that, during his June 2023 meeting with Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei, the latter had ‘reiterated [the need to] develop the arming of the West Bank and the resistance there.""Nakhaleh added: ""We, as Palestinians and as resistance forces and movements, understand the importance of arming the West Bank, but this requires efforts by the Palestinians themselves, and also the assistance of our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran.""All of this helps to explain Iran’s laser-like focus on creating multiple war fronts against the tiny Jewish state.OUTRAGE AS IRAN PRESIDENT PREPARES TO ADDRESS UN: 'WANTS TO KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS'The militant Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel at daybreak Saturday, firing thousands of rockets as dozens of Hamas fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations by air, land and sea and catching the country off guard on a major holiday.(AP Photo/Hassan Eslaiah)The former Israeli counter-terrorism official, Carmon, told Fox News Digital that Hamas’s war is aimed ""to prevent normalizationbetween Israel and Saudi Arabia"" with respect to diplomatic relations.Brigadier General (Res) Amir Avivi, a former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces' Gaza Division, told Fox News Digital that ""Iran funds Hamas by tens of millions of dollars per month. Hamas is an Iranian proxy that dominates the Gaza Strip and is acting in accordance to its instructions, in particular since Hamas' number two Saleh Aruri became a much more dominant figure in the organization.""Avivi added: ""Iran sees Saudi Arabia and other pragmatic Sunni countries begin to normalize relations with Israel and seeks to strengthen the Iranian-Hamas-Hezbollah axis around the Middle East. Hezbollah made a statement calling Arab countries to stop normalization efforts. That is why we have to unite behind the Israeli-American-pragmatic Sunni bloc and defeat terrorism wherever it acts. Iran provides Hamas with ammunition, training and equipment, including smuggling through the Rafah tunnels and training inside Iran.""IRAN MOVES TOWARD POSSIBLE ATOM BOMB TEST IN DEFIANCE OF WESTERN SANCTIONS: INTEL REPORTTexas Republican Senator Ted Cruz blamed Tehran for the war against Israel, writing on X (formerly known as Twitter): ""Iran-controlled Hamas terrorists launched a literal war against Israel tonight.

Hamas also took more than 200 hostages, and Israel has pounded Gaza in the weeks since, leading to accusations in an open letter signed by hundreds of former and current journalists that Israel is engaged in ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing.""""We are renewing the call for journalists to tell the full truth without fear or favor,""the letter states. ""To use precise terms that are well-defined by international human rights organizations, including ‘apartheid,’ ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘genocide.’ To recognize that contorting our words to hide evidence of war crimes or Israel’s oppression of Palestinians is journalistic malpractice and an abdication of moral clarity.""The letter, which said Israel was guilty of ""atrocities,"" also noted the dozens of journalists who have been killed in the war. It made just one mention of Hamas and complained that the war was improperly contextualized, despite being initiated by Hamas' devastating terrorist attack.HAMAS TELLS NY TIMES IT HOPES WAR WITH ISRAEL IS ‘PERMANENT,’ PAPER SAYS HAMAS NOT INTERESTED IN GOVERNINGA group of protestors entered the atrium of The New York Times building in Midtown Manhattan carrying a banner calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.((Photo by Fatih Aktas/Anadolu via Getty Images)""Since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, in which more than 1,200 Israelis, including four journalists, were killed and some 240 others captured, these issues have compounded,"" the letter states. ""News coverage has positioned the attack as the starting point of the conflict without offering necessary historical context — that Gaza is a de facto prison of refugees from historic Palestine, that Israel’s occupation is illegal under international law, and that Palestinians are bombarded and massacred regularly by the Israeli government.""""My hope for this letter is to push back on the culture of fear around this issue, and to make decision-makers and reporters and editors think twice about the language that they use,"" Abdallah Fayyad, a former editorial board member at the Boston Globe, told theWashington Post.Other signers from mainstream and left-leaning outlets represented in the letter include the Los Angeles Times, New Yorker, New York magazine, Washington Post, MSNBC, Bloomberg, Daily Beast, Chicago Sun-Times, HuffPost, and The Guardian.On Nov. 10, the letter was updated to remove a signer with the Associated Press, although it was unclear who it was.The AP suspendedanother reporter, Issam Adwan, from covering the war in Gaza last month after a media watchdog exposed his fervently anti-Israel social media postings. The AP didn't respond to a request for comment.But it's not just the demand for harsher coverage of Israel, which has been commonplace over the years when the ongoing conflict has made international news.

Opinion editor David Shipley wrote a mea culpa about the decision, saying some readers found it ""racist,"" and a separate email to staff by executive editor Sally Buzbee noted the ""deep concerns"" in the newsroom about it.Ramirez told Fox News Digital the incident was ""unfortunate"" but praised his employer, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, for standing behind him and the cartoon. The Post has an agreement where his cartoon appears in both outlets simultaneously twice a week, and Ramirez is reconsidering the deal after the Post's action.""People are emotionally invested in their politics,"" Ramirez said of the reaction to the cartoon. ""So it's always going to cause a reaction, this one moreso just because of the heated debate that's going on with the issue.""One Post insider credited Shipley for limiting the fallout by acting quickly on the matter, although they acknowledged they didn't expect the cartoon would cause a dust-up.""There was both external criticism and internal criticism. I think a number of people inside and outside were offended by the caricature, both of the man and the woman. I’m not sure, however, if the message itself was the problem,"" they told Fox News Digital, adding, ""I went right past that cartoon and didn’t think anything about it until I started hearing the rumbles about it.""POLITICAL CARTOONIST SPEAKS OUT AFTER WASHINGTON POST PULLS HIS WORK MOCKING HAMASRamirez supplied examples to Fox News Digital of other pictures he's drawn that use similarly exaggerated features, in response to accusations that he was crudely drawing Arabs.Cartoonist Michael Ramirez sent Fox News Digital examples of other exaggerated renderings he's done of people after he received backlash for his portrayal of a Hamas spokesman.(Michael Ramirez/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Creators Syndicate)TheNew York Times, no stranger to criticism over its coverage of the war, got a taste of pressure from the outside last week as well.A group of protesters entered the atrium of the Times building in Manhattan carrying a banner calling for a cease-fire.

On the other hand, the Times has taken criticism from pro-Israel voices for some of its coverage, most notably when the newspaper admitted it relied ""too heavily"" on Hamas claims for its initial report on the Gaza hospital explosion last month.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFor more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion and channel coverage, visitfoxnews.com/media.Fox News' Lawrence Richard contributed to this report.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

""Presidents of these universities need to take heed before they make these woke decisions that adversely impact the reputation of these elite institutions because they have awakened the sleeping giant of donors who are now saying, ‘I'm not just going to write a check anymore and automatically give them money no matter what they say or do.’""Several top universities, including UPenn, have drawn criticism for allowing pro-Palestinian student groups to rally and express anti-Israel sentiments. Several major donors have cut off support from the Ivy League school, and drove Gureghian and a board of advisors member to resign.UPenn faced criticism prior to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel for hosting a ""Palestine Writes Literature Festival"" featuring speakers with a history of antisemitism despite alumni and students' appeals to cancel or condemn the event, Fox News previously reported. Gureghian, who was still a trustee at the time, was surprised the university's president, Liz Magill, let the Sept. 22 event proceed after concerns were raised.""There's plenty of people on the board, all of whom are substantial men and women, that you could get advice and counsel from, and clearly they would give you the advice and counsel to cancel,"" he said.

Lieba Nesis, entertainment writer for The Jewish Voice, told Fox News Digital in an interview that Gad has previously ""felt the need to correct himself"" for his initial reaction expressing sympathy for Israel, writing on social media he was ""personally attacked, shamed, unfollowed and threatened"" and reiterated his long-standing criticism of the Israeli government's ""occupation and their attacks on innocent Gazans.""Fox News Digital's Jeffrey Clark contributed to this update.Newly-minted House Speaker Mike Johnsontold FOX Newsin his first television interview since gaining the gavel that the U.S. stands firmly behind Israel, while back at home, lawmakers and the Biden administration alike must find common ground and acknowledge ""God is not done"" with America yet.Johnson told ""Hannity"" the House is primed to proffer a $14.5 billion support bill for Israel, slightly more than what the Louisiana Republican said Israel – via the White House – has asked for.However, a key difference between the House appropriation and other federal support is that the money will come in exchange for ""pay-for's"" in the budget, rather than simply printing the money.Johnson said the figure is a ""very specific number tied to very specific measures"" and that each dollar should be offset by a cut elsewhere.In terms of potential U.S. military involvement in Israel's fight for survival against Iran-backed Hamas, Johnson said he is hopeful to avert a boots-on-the-ground situation, but added that during a White House meeting Thursday he reminded President Biden's staff that they have limited ability to directly respond without congressional approval.The Founding Fathers, he said, envisioned a ""multitude of wise counsel"" in such matters, which he noted is why Congress has the power to declare war, not the executive branch.Johnson addedthat he has met previously with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and agreed that while Americans talk of ""existential threats"" stateside, Israel faces one or more daily.""Their neighbors want to eliminate them,"" he said.""America will back [Netanyahu] up – they tell us when we're in Israel the reason we're able to sustain ourselves and survive is because everybody knows our big ally is America.""White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that theU.S. strikes on Iranian proxies in Syriawere targeting weapons and storage facilities.“These strikes were in self defense,” Kirby said on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""Hours earlier, the U.S. military conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria in response to ongoing attacks against American military personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past week, according to the Department of Defense.A pair of F-16s targeted two facilities – a weapons depot and an ammo storage area – near Abu Kamal used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News' Jennifer Griffin.

Hamas has launched thousands of rockets at Israel since the start of the war on Oct. 7, intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure.Israel has responded byhammering the Gaza Stripwith airstrikes and conducting brief ground incursions to pave the way for a future full-scale invasion. Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told journalists Friday it is not a question of if, but when Israel conducts a ground operation to eliminate Hamas.Israeli raids overnight by land and sea targeted tunnel infrastructure beneath the Gaza Strip as the number of hostages held captive by Hamas has risen to 229 people.The rescue of hostages and destruction of Hamas military capabilities are among the main mission objectives for the Israeli military, Gallant said.Fox News' Trey Yingst contributed to this update.Overnight, anIsrael Defense Forcesraid struck a compound use by Hamas' naval forces, the military said.""IDF soldiers of Flotilla 13 conducted a targeted raid from the sea in the southern Gaza Strip. During the activity, the soldiers struck Hamas military infrastructure and operated in a compound used by Hamas' commando naval forces,"" the IDF said.The soldiers were assisted by Israeli Navy vessels and aircraft. IDF forces exited the area after the raid was carried out.Hamas terrorists in a statement claimed to have repelled the Israeli raid from the sea.IDF earlier said it killed the commander of Hamas' West Khan Younis Battalion, Madhat Mubasher, in an overnight airstrike in the Gaza Strip. Mubasher ""took part in sniper attacks and was responsible for large explosive devices [used] against IDF forces and Israeli towns,"" according to the military.Separately, IDF said it carried out more than 250 airstrikes against Hamas targets in the past day.Fox News' Yael Rotem-Kuriel contributed to this update.The legacy media’s widely panned coverage of last week'sGaza hospital explosionraised eyebrows across the globe and resulted in multiple corrections and editor’s notes. National Center for Audio and Video Forensics founder David Notowitz, who sniffs out deceptive and misleading evidence for a living, was among the many who were stunned anyone allowed the Hamas-backed Gaza Health Ministry to set the initial framing of the story.Notowitz believes the media backlash could have been avoided if journalists simply followed the common-sense methods he uses when determining the trustworthiness of evidence and sources.""Hamas is not a reliable news source, ever. Now, you should be skeptical of anything they give you. It might be real, but you should be skeptical. Skeptical of any videos, any stills, any news they give you. It could be accurate, but check your sources and check other sources other than them,"" Notowitz told Fox News Digital.""A missile was shot off from Gaza intending to reach Jews. It misfired, landed in a parking lot in the Gaza hospital. Immediately, Hamas Health Ministry announced it was the fault of the IDF. And immediately, The New York Times, Reuters, BBC, they all swallowed it. They didn't even look into it,"" Notowitz added. ""They didn't try to get other opinions… way too quick on them for doing that.""Fox News Digital's Brian Flood contributed to this update.AHamas officialsaid Friday that the Palestinian terrorist group cannot release the hostages it has captured during its war with Israel until a ceasefire deal is reached, a report says.The Russian newspaper Kommersant quoted Abu Hamid – a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow – as saying that Hamas needs to locate where Palestinian factions have taken the hostages inside the Gaza Strip, according to Reuters.""They seized dozens of people, most of them civilians, and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them,"" Hamid reportedly said, noting that a calm environment was needed to do so.The development comes as the number of hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists has risen to 229, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari said Friday.Friday's number is five more than the 224 hostages reported on Thursday, and the number is likely to change as various operations continue to unfold, Hagari said.Since Hamas began taking hostages during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, only four have been released from custody – a mother-daughter duo from the Chicago area and two elderly Israeli women.Fox News Digital's Greg Norman contributed to this update.The U.S. on Friday lobbed additionalsanctions against the Palestinian terror group Hamasafter the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, which started a war.The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement the measures targeted additional assets in a Hamas investment portfolio and people facilitating sanctions evasion by Hamas-affiliated companies, including a Hamas official in Iran and members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.A Gaza-based entity that Treasury said has served as a conduit for illicit Iranian funds to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group was also targeted, the department said. Iran backs Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East.""Hamas has built their own illicit networks for terror by taking many of the same steps the Kremlin is taking to avoid our financial sanctions. And much like many Russian elites, senior Hamas officials often live in luxury, while the average Gazan faces dire living conditions,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wall Adeyemo said in a speech Friday announcing the sanctions.""Almost immediately after its horrific attacks, Hamas solicited donations to fund its continued terrorist activities,"" he said. ""Our goal is to cut off those financial resources, while ensuring humanitarian aid can continue to flow to the Palestinian people in Gaza.""Reuters contributed to this update.Rep.

This is the first official meeting of a senior Qatari representative with an Israel family since the outbreak of the war.""As a parent, a father of three children held by Hamas in Gaza, I hope Qatar will continue its efforts to immediately return home my wife and three children, and the more than 30 children held hostage by Hamas,"" Brodutch said.IDF spokesperson Rear Adm.

The IDF killed Hamas operatives and destroyed rocket launch sites, he said.""In the coming hours we will reveal evidence that shows Hamas's use of humanitarian facilities for terrorist infrastructures in a way that endangers the citizens of Gaza"" he added. ""I repeat, we will expose these materials that connect Hamas to the cynical use it makes of humanitarian facilities.""Hagari also updated the number of deceased IDF soldiers to 310 and the number of hostages to 229. ""We continue to put in the most effort – the civilian effort, the operational effort, the intelligence effort to do one thing – bringing the hostages home is the highest priority,"" he said.Hagari added, ""Hamas prefers, at any point in time, to endanger the residents of the Gaza Strip in order to protect terrorists. At every point, he prefers to get food, electricity and medical equipment to Hamas terrorists than to the citizens of Gaza who are not involved in the war. We will expose these evidence and bring them to the attention of the world and the public.""Fox News' Lawrence Richard contributed to this update.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says theground invasion of Gazais ""close"" and that the world should prepare for a lengthy battle to eradicate Hamas in the Palestinian territory.""It's not a question of weeks, but a question of months,"" Gallant told Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Friday.Israel has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops along the border with Gaza and launched several small-scale ground incursions to hit terrorist targets. But a full-scale invasion to eradicate Hamas, promised after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in which 1,400 Israelis were brutally murdered, has so far not come to fruition.Gallant said he cannot give a precise date for the start of the operation, but plans are underway for the Israelis to enter Gaza and destroy Hamas and its governing capabilities. The army's mission is to return some 229 hostages to their families, secure Israel's southern area and deter Israel's adversaries in the region from joining the war.""I'm the son of holocaust survivors,"" Gallant said.

Security Council this week says he is seeing positive signs at the international body amid efforts to find common ground on ways to resolve the crisis that erupted from the Hamas terror attack on Israel.""The U.N. is an opportunity, a place where you expose difference in order to try to find solutions. So you shouldn't walk in expecting to find unanimity, you should walk in expecting to find difference so that you can find areas of common ground that you work on,"" Tom Tugendhat, the U.K. Minister of State for Security, told Fox News Digital in an interview.Tugendhat took the U.K. chair for the Security Council for a meeting on the situation in the Middle East, and used it to express British support for its ally Israel.""The U.K. stands resolutely with Israel in defending itself against terror,"" he told the Council. ""We are clear that it must act in line with international humanitarian law and take every possible step to avoid harming civilians. We have given that message to Israel as a friend and ally, and we restate that position in this Council.""Tugendhat told Fox News Digital after the meeting that there were two clear messages that emerged from the gathering and his discussions with other governments' officials.""The first is Israel's right to self-defense,"" he said. ""It is simply unacceptable that the state of Israel should have to be there to get murdered by Palestinian terrorists, Hamas, every few weeks, months or years. That's clearly unacceptable. The second thing is that the Palestinian people should not suffer for the fact that Hamas has occupied and controlled that territory for… 30 or so years and therefore, finding ways in which we can get aid in through the Rafah crossing and support Palestinian civilians is incredibly important.""""Is that the answer to all it?

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/israel-two-important-things,I just came back from Israel and saw these two important things,"I have must returned from a trip to Israel where I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem. President Biden must be committed to Israel, too.",April 10,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"British Foreign Secretary David Cameron joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Britain's position as the war in Israel continues.Israel changed on October 7, 2023, whenIran-backed Hamas terroristsattacked and killed thousands of innocent people. Everywhere you look in Israel the scars of terror are present, but through the devastation, I saw an unbreakable resolve in the Israeli people and their government. I made clear to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when I met with him in Jerusalem that I will always stand with Israel. Now, President Biden must show that his administration and Democrats in Washington will do the same, stop cowering to the radical left of their party in a disgusting and dangerous attempt to get votes from Hamas-sympathizers, and force Qatar to do its job in securing the immediate release of hostages and ending its coddling of Hamas leadership.While in Israel, I saw two important things very clearly. First, I saw the absolute evil of Israel’s enemies and their brutality. I saw where Jewish people were killed just for being Jewish, where women were raped and murdered and babies butchered. I talked with people who experienced the attack firsthand and thankfully survived, and they told me what happened to them, their families and friends.I saw parents setting up memorials at theNova Music Festival sitefor their children who have been taken hostage or murdered. I stood in a destroyed home and listened to the last words of a young Israeli woman via audio recording as she talked to her father before Hamas gunned her down. I met with the families of American hostages whose devastation and grief is overwhelming. And I saw firsthand what Israel faces from Iran and its proxies and what they would do to us, too, if they can.TOP DEMS TURN ON ISRAEL AFTER BIDEN CALL WITH NETANYAHUSecond, in meetings with thePrime Minister Netanyahuand Israeli leaders, I saw the incredible and unprecedented work Israel is doing to preserve civilian life and get aid into Gaza.We are all heartbroken by the accidental Israeli strike on a humanitarian aid convoy that killed seven aid workers, including an American citizen. Israel did the right thing and immediately took responsibility, apologized, and launched an investigation, as it always does. Any civilian death is tragic and should be avoided at all costs – and the death of any American should demand the accountability and apology that Israel has promised and delivered. Israel is doing more to prevent civilian deaths than any warfighting nation has been expected to do in history and taking responsibility when tragic incidents happen.BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU THAT US WILL CHANGE POLICY ON GAZA UNLESS ISRAEL PROTECTS CIVILIANSThere will be accountability for this tragedy, and we pray that something like this never happens again, but what President Biden and Democrats cannot do is allow it to blind them to the fact that Hamas is still holding Americans hostage, or allow them to ignore the undeniable fact that the United States and Israel have a common security interest indestroying Hamasand getting these hostages back home today. Hamas must be destroyed and that means going in Rafah and any other place Hamas is hiding behind innocent civilians.I truly believe that if Netanyahu had taken Rafah when he wanted and destroyed Hamas, the war would be nearly over. But at every step, the U.S. has forced Israel to go slow and all Biden has done with that time is use it to build his attacks on and betrayal of Israel, and forced the hostages to languish in captivity even longer.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe five Americans that are being held hostage by Hamas have been held in captivity for more than half a year. It is unacceptable that President Biden, senior members of his administration and Democrats in Washington continue to attack Israel, call for the ousting of its democratically-elected government, and allow the abandonment of our ally at theUnited Nationsand on the world stage. And it is disgusting that while they launch these attacks on our ally, Democrats say little or nothing about the fact that American citizens are being held hostage by a brutal, murderous terrorist organization that we know is committing horrific sexual abuse against these innocent people.But speaking every single day about the hostages still being held by Hamas, as I have done since this attack happened, is not enough. While his reported letter to Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamin bin Hamad Al Thani is a start,Biden must do moreto force Qatar do its job in securing the immediate and safe release of all hostages.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPQatar has had months to secure the release of hostages from Hamas. How this has not yet been accomplished. Why is Qatar allowing the leaders of Hamas to live in luxury and under protection in Doha while American citizens remain tortured in the captivity of terrorists? That must end now and we need to see concrete evidence today that Qatar is doing its job as a U.S. ally to get our hostages and all hostages being held by Hamas out. Qatar enjoys many of the benefits of being an American ally, including hosting a U.S. military base. If the Qataris won’t do their part to get our hostages out, everything should be on the table in terms of consequences for its inaction.My latest trip to Israel is my sixth visit since I was elected asgovernor of Floridain 2010 and my third as Florida’s U.S. Senator. The State of Florida and Israel have always had a strong relationship, and each time I visit I am reminded of that bond between our people and the importance of supporting the Jewish state. I will never walk away from Israel and am more committed than ever to forcing the Biden administration to stand by our great ally as it fights for its existence against the unimaginable barbarism of Iran-backed terror.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

It was meant as an incentive for Hamas to govern peacefully but instead financed miles of terror tunnels under civilian infrastructure. Also in January 2023, Netanyahu led government reforms that curbed judiciary powers, prompting large-scale protests.""You are weakening us, and our enemy is going to see it, and we’re going to pay the price,"" former Minister of Defense Benny Gantz cautioned Netanyahu at the time.The prime minister placed blame on the protesters, many of whom said they would not serve in the Israeli military if the country's democratic institutions were weakened.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""The refusal to serve because of an internal political debate – I think that, if anything, that had an effect,"" Netanyahu told Time.Netanyahu said his biggest mistake, however, was not going to war with Hamas in the past, listening to his security cabinet, which opposed such a move. For years, Israel's strategy was to respond to Hamas' attacks periodically by striking back and damaging them to the point of the terror group agreeing to a cease-fire that ultimately kept them in control of Gaza, with the ability to bolster their terror infrastructure that includes a complex network of underground tunnels.Time reported that when Israel did go to war against Hamas for less than two months in 2014, Israeli officials said the security cabinet brought Netanyahu a plan to end the terror organization. The plan was predicted to lead to the deaths of approximately 10,000 Gazan civilians and 500 Israeli soldiers.""There was no domestic support for such an action,"" Netanyahu told Time regarding that plan. ""There was certainly no international support for such an action – and you need both.""Danielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.

Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus joins 'FOX News Live' to describe the 'barbaric crimes' on the Israeli community by Hamas terrorists.JERUSALEM- After more than 12 hours of ongoing terror and rocket attacks by Palestinian terrorists from Gaza in Israeli communities in the south, Israeli civilians along the country’s northern border – close to Lebanon – slept uneasily on Saturday night, fearing a similar attack by theIranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah.On Sunday morning, even as Israeli forces continued to battle Hamas fighters near Gaza, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for firing shots into a disputed area known as Mount Dov. Israel retaliated by striking Hezbollah infrastructure, according to the IDF spokesperson, including taking out two tents that the terrorist group erected there in June.Amir Avivi, CEO of the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), told Fox News Digital that he was surprised that Hamas’s attack on Saturday was not coordinated with Hezbollah or that Hezbollah did not take advantage of the events unfolding to also attack Israel.IRAN-FUNDED TERROR PROXIES LAUNCH WAR AGAINST ISRAEL AMID SURPRISE INVASION AGAINST JEWISH STATEThe fence of an Israeli military position is seen damaged after Hezbollah targeted it by rockets, on an occupied hill of Kfar Chouba village, southeast Lebanon, Sunday, Oct. 8, 2023. Israeli soldiers battled Hamas fighters in the streets of Israel's south on Sunday and exchanged strikes with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group in the north, while Israel's retaliation strikes leveled buildings in Gaza. The prospect of Hezbollah joining the fighting a day after an unprecedented surprise attack from Gaza raised the chances of a broader conflict.(AP Photo/Hussein Malla)Avivi, a Brigadier General (Res), and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces' Gaza Division, told Fox News Digital that ""This was really the big chance for Iran to start, by surprise, a multi-fronted war against Israel, which would have been much more devastating because they would have conquered all of Israel’s towns in the north,"" he said.Avivi said that Hezbollah’s failure tojoin forces with Hamascould have been due to an Iranian desire to keep the Shiite group intact for any future confrontations. If both groups attacked Israel together, he theorized, they might end up being destroyed and leaving Iran more vulnerable.He said that the shooting on Sunday was definitely a message from Hezbollah. ""It was very pinpointed and, in a place, where no people live,"" said Avivi.""Officially our routine here has continued, but I don’t think anybody slept well last night,"" Sarit Zehavi, founder and president of the Alma Education and Research Center, which focuses on Israel’s security challenges on its northern border, told Fox News Digital.Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah speaks via a video link, as his supporters raise their hands, during the Shiite holy day of Ashoura, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, in Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022.

She said that she wants to believe Israel’s military is also preparing for any possible confrontations with Hezbollah.""Right now, we are focusing on the next steps, and clearly on a political level the next step is trying to prevent the opening of another front, while militarily it is trying to prepare for the possibility of another front,"" said Zehavi. ""And there is no doubt thatthe Iraniansare interested in opening other fronts.""Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that whether other fronts might erupt for Israel was the ""six million dollar question.""A huge mural of Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei Iran's Supreme Leader painted next to a smaller one of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (R) seen on Motahari street on March 8, 2020 in Tehran, Iran.(Kaveh Kazemi/Getty Images)She said that the Sunday morning shooting appeared to be an act of solidarity with Hamas as opposed to a declaration of war but ""as I understand it the war in Gaza will take a long time and there might be other occasions for Hezbollah to try something while the IDF is busy in the South.""""According to my understanding, Hezbollah does not want to be dragged into a situation where Hamas is leading them,"" said Mizrahi, who previously served as Israel’s deputy national security advisor on foreign policy. ""But there might be a temptation to take advantage of this opportunity.""Smoke rises over Gaza City on October 7, 2023 during Israeli air strikes.(MAHMUD HAMS/AFP via Getty Images)Mizrahi said that the scenario of terrorists infiltrating Israeli border communities was usually one applied to the north and the discovery several years ago of attack tunnels dug by Hezbollah fueled that possibility. Now that Hamas has used this tactic, taking Israel by surprise on Saturday, killing more than 300 people, and taking multiple hostages, Hezbollah has lost its advantage, she explained.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MIDDLE EAST'S HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS GROUPS?""Maybe they will try some small acts of solidarity or maybe there will be some accidents, but not a very wide war that will open a second front,"" said Mizrahi, highlighting that there are strong voices in Lebanon cautioning Hezbollah against taking such action.""Besides, the IDF is now ready and prepared for them on the northern border, so they have lost the element of surprise,"" she added.Palestinian gunmen from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades appear carrying their weapons during a military parade in the Balata refugee camp, east of Nablus, in the northern West Bank.

""The IDF is now mobilizing hundreds of thousands of soldiers and compared to what happened [two years ago], I think we are experiencing something very different.""""The more determined IDF is in gaining control of Gaza and destroying Hamas, the less chance there will be of more fronts happening,"" Avivi added.

Hamas’ hostage taking, their hostage taking of children, of the disabled, elderly civilians, are a war crime,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""But when we are talking about the blockading of water, food, electricity to a population of 2.2 million Palestinians, it is unacceptable to think that 1,700 Palestinian children alone, that their deaths will somehow make up for, or justify, the violence of what we saw on Oct. 7.""AOC ACCUSES ISRAEL OF WAR CRIMES: HAMAS COMMITTED ‘HORRIFIC’ ATTACKS, ‘HOWEVER…’Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.( Andrew Harnik/Pool/AFP via Getty Images/File)The progressive ""Squad"" member went on to accuse Israel of committing an ""indiscriminate bombing campaign"" against Gaza and questioned the effectiveness of its recent actions.The congressional representative did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital on the matter.Ret.

The first thing was that she acknowledged the conduct of Hamas terrorists Oct. 7 were war crimes, yet failed to acknowledge that 8,000 rockets have been fired indiscriminately at Israel since that date.""Every time one of those rockets is fired, it is a war crime because the law of war doesn’t focus on whether you kill civilians. It focuses on the fact that you’re trying to kill civilians,"" he said.‘SQUAD’ REP. TLAIB IGNORES US INTEL ABOUT GAZA HOSPITAL, SIDES WITH HAMAS OVER BIDEN ADMINRockets are launched by Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip towards Israel, in Gaza, Oct. 7.(AP Photo/Hatem Moussa)The second thing that jumped out is the characterization of the consequences of combat operations as collective punishment.He said, ""collective punishment"" is a phrase being tossed around that is ""simply erroneous,"" because it requires an intent to inflict collective suffering on the population because of something that happened to your forces.""Collective consequences of combat is not the same thing as collective punishment, and the prohibition on collective punishment is more focused,"" Corn said.He explained that during World War II, the Germans would have a soldier killed by the French resistance, and in retribution, they would round up 50 civilians and execute them as a collective sanction.MEDIA ACCUSED OF PARROTING HAMAS' TALKING POINTS ON GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST, IDF SPOX SAYS TERROR GROUP ‘LYING’Smoke plumes along the Gaza-Israel border on Oct. 7.(Gallo Images/Orbital Horizon/Copernicus Sentinel Data 2023)""There’s no indication that the Israeli military operations are directed for that purpose,"" Corn said. ""Instead, they’re directed to destroy Hamas combat capability as a legitimate exercise of self-defense.""But the most troubling aspect, he said, of Ocasio-Cortez’s accusation is that it is ""factually and legally invalid.""""I think for somebody in a position of a member of Congress, they bear an obligation to ensure that before they accuse soldiers and pilots of committing war crimes, that they understand what the law is that dictates that accusation,"" Corn said. ""The fact that civilian casualties are inflicted during combat operations does not prove thecommission of war crimes.""Expanding on the subject, Corn said war crimes in combat are established by proving either that an attack was deliberately directed against civilians — which he said what Hamas has been doing, but not the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] — or that an attack on the military objective is conducted in a way that is inherently indiscriminate because the anticipated civilian harm will be excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage derived from the attack.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPUnless a person knows what the value of the target was, the efforts the IDF went through to verify the true nature of the target, the precautionary measures IDF implemented to mitigate civilian risk, the way Hamas abused the civilian population to shield the target from attack, and other factors, Corn said a person cannot make a credible accusationagainst Israelfor committing war crimes.""This is the problem of what I've called ‘effects-based condemnations,’ where you look at the effects of an attack, and you immediately assume that the party that caused the destruction must have committed a war crime, and it's legally and factually invalid,"" he said. ""Candidly, it's quite disappointing that a member of our Congress would make that allegation. And it also demeans the integrity and the honor of the IDF combatants who, in my opinion and based on my experience, are actually trying much harder than their enemy to take measures that mitigate the risks to the civilian population.""Fox News Digital's Lindsay Kornick contributed to this report.Greg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.Story tips and can be sent to Greg.Wehner@Fox.com and on Twitter @GregWehner.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

I've been very clear about that,"" Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told Fox News Digital Tuesday.In a call last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following an airstrike from the country that killed seven workers delivering food and aid in Gaza, Biden called for an immediate cease-fire to address the need to get aid to the war zone.Biden's move to endorse a cease-fire comes as pro-Palestinian protests have plagued his campaign events in recent months.PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS' PAINTED RED HANDS A 'SYMBOL' ROOTED IN 'CRAZE TO SEE BLOOD': EXPERTDemocratic senators revealed their concerns about the war in Israel.(Getty Images)""There's been far too much civilian death right now,"" Sen.

However, the resolution did not include condemnation of Hamas, which prompted criticism against the Biden administration.At a Senate Republican lunch Tuesday, GOP conference Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., circulated a document to his colleagues, listing ""27 times Biden & Democrats abandoned Israel"" since the initial Oct. 7 Hamas attack.GOP SENATORS CONVINCE SPEAKER JOHNSON TO DELAY MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT ARTICLE DELIVERYThe document, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, listed events, including the Biden administration urging Israel to end a ground campaign in Gaza last year and Senate Democrats in November voting against a stand-alone Israel aid bill that did not tie the assistance to aid for Ukraine.""President Biden is demanding a highly damaging, unconditional cease-fire. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are equating Prime Minister Netanyahu to Hamas. These unprecedented actions undermine Israel’s mission to free the hostages and eliminate Hamas,"" Barrasso told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement.Asked how Biden was handling support for Israel at the same time as addressing concerns for Palestinian civilians, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said, ""It's a challenging situation.""Sen.

(Credit: Alma Research and Education Center)DespiteIsrael’s nearly one-year-long warwith Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks, security experts continue to sound the alarm that Jerusalem’s greatest threat actually lies to the north in Lebanon, where Hezbollah has developed a sophisticated tunnel system.Hezbollah, an Islamic terrorist organization that has long had the backing of Iran, has over the last two decades developed a network of tunnels that stretch more than 100 miles in cumulative length throughout southern Lebanon.Though the existence of the tunnels has been known for decades, the significant role they play in arming Hezbollah has once again come to light during the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, where terrorists have not only relied on tunnels for operational rearmament and maneuvering capabilities but also tohouse hostages taken by Hamasnearly a year ago.While it is estimated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) haveeradicated roughly 80% of Hamas’ tunnels, Hezbollah’s tunnels, which have largely remained untouched since the war in Gaza began, are believed to be far more sophisticated and ""significantly larger,"" according to areportby the Alma Research and Education Center, a nonprofit organization that researches Israeli security challenges along its northern border.NETANYAHU HITS BACK OVER GLOBAL PRESSURE TO MAKE CEASE-FIRE CONCESSIONS, SAYS DEMANDS ARE 'IMMORAL', 'INSANE'A guided tour by the Israeli army on June 3, 2019, shows the interior of a tunnel under the Lebanese-Israeli border.(JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images)Hezbollah is believed to have begun mining its tunnels after the Second Lebanon War in 2006 in close coordination between Iran and North Korea after Tehran reportedly derived ""inspiration"" from Pyongyang and the tunnels that it developed in the aftermath of the Korean War.Iran deemed North Korea a ""professional authority on the subject of tunneling"" due to its experience in digging tunnels for military use when it attempted to drill tunnels across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in an attempt to militarily invade areas just north of Seoul, the capital of South Korea.While the tunnels and their intended use were never realized by the authoritarian nation,two of the four neutralized tunnelsuncovered were reportedly capable of accommodating up to 30,000 troops per hour along with armaments like armored personnel carriers, tanks and field artillery – an operational blueprint Hezbollah has turned to in its fight against Israel.The report found that Hezbollah under the advisership of North Korea – a relationship that may have begun as far back as the 1980s – built two types of tunnels across southern Lebanon, ""offensive tunnels and infrastructure tunnels.""This image provided on Friday shows the comparison between tunnels dug by North Korea and Hezbollah.(Alma Research and Education Center)The offensive tunnels were intended for similar operational use as North Korea’s, and at least six tunnels were discovered by IDF forces that led into Israeli territory during Operation Northern Shield, which began in December 2018.Alma's research found that some of Hezbollah’s tunnels are also capable of transporting ATVs, motorcycles and other ""small vehicles,"" though it did not specify the number of terrorists that they could accommodate.The tunnels are equipped with ""underground command and control rooms, weapons and supply depots, field clinics and specified designated shafts used to fire missiles of all types,"" the report said, noting that arms like rockets, surface-to-surface missiles, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles can be fired from ""shafts"" in the tunnels. ""These shafts are hidden and camouflaged and cannot be detected above ground.""DOJ CHARGES HAMAS LEADERS OVER 'TERRORIST ATROCITIES' IN OCT 7 ISRAEL ATTACKThe tunnels are believed to connect the capital of Beirut, where Hezbollah’s central headquarters is located and its logistical base in the Beqaa Valley near the Syrian border, to southern Lebanon.This image provided on Friday lays out the areas where Hezbollah has infiltrated in Lebanon.(Alma Research and Education Center)""We call this inter-regional tunnel network ‘Hezbollah's Land of the Tunnels,’"" theAlma report first released in 2021detailed, noting the tunnel system is more akin to a ""metro"" of tunnels rather than one long tunnel.The second series of tunnels Hezbollah mined, known as the infrastructure tunnels, form an underground network in and near southern Lebanese villages that establishes the first and second ""lines of defense"" against an Israeli invasion – a project of ""enormous magnitude,"" according to the Alma report.One such tunnel is estimated to be nearly 28 miles long, prompting the question as to how the terrorist organization was able to get away with building such a sophisticated system without opposition from the Lebanese government.Hezbollah terrorists take part in a training exercise in Aaramta village in southern Lebanon in May 2023.(AP/Hassan Ammar)""Hezbollah does try to keep the locations, routes, internal structure, etc., of these tunnels a secret. [It] does this by expropriating territories, by preventing civilians from entering into certain areas and by taking advantage of [its] presence and influence in the government,"" Boaz Shapira, a researcher with Alma, told Fox News Digital.Shapira said Hezbollah not only has the support of roughly 40%-50% of the Lebanese population, it is ""much better funded, organized, trained and armed"" than the Lebanese government, army, police or even the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which has aforce of some 10,500 peacekeeping troopsin Lebanon and that were put in place after the 2006 war.Spanish U.N. peacekeepers stand on a hill overlooking the Lebanese border with Israel on Jan. 10, 2024.Hezbollah’s cooperation with authoritarian nations like Iran and North Korea has long made it a major threat to Israel.But its growing power within Lebanon has moved it to the top of the list when it comes to Israeli security threats, according to not only Shapira but also former IDF Major Gen. Yaakov Amidror.""Lebanon’s government is too weak to counter Hezbollah,"" Amidror told Fox News Digital. ""Everything important is decided by Hezbollah, not by the government.""HEZBOLLAH OPERATIVES KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES AS TERROR GROUP FIRES 100 ROCKETS AT JEWISH STATEHezbollah is believed to haveas many as 50,000 terroristsand, according to Shapira, its sphere of influence has extended to nearly every branch of Lebanon’s security apparatus.""Taking action against Hezbollah would be perceived as cooperation with Israel and basically as treason in Lebanon, and in the past year also against the Palestinians,"" he said. ""That means that no one in the army has any incentive for challenging Hezbollah.""Hezbollah terror forces train in southern Lebanon close to the Israeli border.(AP/Hassan Ammar/File)Shapira said demographics inside the once predominately Christian nation have shifted over the last several decades, and it now has a majority Muslim population – though the U.S. State Department analyzes the breakdown in Muslim populations in Lebanon as nearly equally dividedbetween Shiite and Sunni groups.""This trend is happening in the army as well. That means that almost every Shiite soldier in the army has a brother, cousin, friend that is a Hezbollah terrorist,"" Shapira said.Amidror, a distinguished fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America after serving as Israel's former national security adviser to the prime minister and a 36-year veteran of the IDF, told Fox News Digital he believes Israel needs to take a proactive approach when it comes to countering Hezbollah.Hezbollah fighters form a human barrier during the funeral procession for top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut's southern suburbs on Aug. 1, 2024.(KHALED DESOUKI/AFP via Getty Images)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""We should initiate the war against Hezbollah,"" he said, noting that the timing of its operation is the main variable that needs to be determined.""It will not be an easy job.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., like several other lawmakers, released a statement condemning Iran’s massive missile attack on Israel, though he also continued to call for a ceasefire hostage deal to resolve a “wider conflict.”“I strongly condemn Iran’s massive missile attack on Israel. For months, leaders in Israel and Iran have chosen to escalate tensions rather than pursue diplomatic solutions,” Sanders said. “They have pushed us to the brink of a wider and more disastrous war. The U.S. must now forcefully demand an end to hostilities.“A ceasefire for [a] hostage deal remains the key to resolving the wider conflict. That could stop the escalatory cycle, and end the bombing and the rocket attacks, and allow displaced people to return to their homes sooner,” he added. “It is the only way to protect civilians, end suffering of the Palestinian people, as well as ensure peace in the region and security for Israel.”Sanders also said the U.S. cannot allow extremist leaders in the Middle East draw our country into another war in the region.The comments came as other lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer issued statements condemning the attacks, as well.""The United States will continue to stand by our ally Israel in support of Israel’s right to defend itself,"" Schumer said.

(AP/Hussein Malla)Israel Defense ForcesSpokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel on Tuesday has declassified military operations aimed at thwarting an October 7-style attack by Hezbollah along the country’s northern border with Lebanon.In a video message,Hagari said the Lebanese terrorist group since the onset of the war in Gaza has fired more than 9,500 rockets at Israeli homes, forcing 60,000 residents to evacuate.“Hezbollah has openly declared that it plans to carry out its own October 7th massacre on Israel's northern border, but on an even larger scale. They call this plan ‘Conquer the Galilee,” Hagari said. “For years, Hezbollah has been planning to do in northern Israel what Hamas did in southern Israel on October 7th: invade Israel, infiltrate civilian communities and massacre innocent civilians. To make sure that Hezbollah can never carry out such an attack and in order to enable all 60,000 Israelis to safely return back to their homes in northern Israel, the IDF is taking action.”“Hezbollah planned to launch their October 7th attack from villages across southern Lebanon, where they have been building up their arms, capabilities and forces for the last two decades. Hezbollah also dug tunnels under homes in these villages close to the border with Israel,” Hagari continued. “Tonight, we are declassifying a series of IDF operations conducted since the beginning of the war aimed at dismantling Hezbollah's terrorist infrastructure and capabilities in the area of the Israel-Lebanon border.”“During this operations, IDF Special Forces entered into Hezbollah compounds in dozens of locations along the border with Israel, collected intelligence, dismantled Hezbollah's weapons and terrorist infrastructures. Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapon caches, and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons,” he also said.“Overall, IDF soldiers exposed and dismantle over 700 Hezbollah terror assets during these operations,” according to Hagari.TheIsrael Defense Forcessaid Tuesday that it has called up "" four additional reserve brigades for operational missions in the northern arena.”“This will enable the continuation of operational activity against the Hezbollah terrorist organization and the achievement of operational goals, including the safe return of the residents of northern Israel to their homes,” the IDF said in a statement.The development comes as Israel’s military is conducting limited ground operations inside Lebanon.A security official handles the remains of a rocket that landed on a highway near Kfar Qasim, Israel, on Tuesday, Oct. 1, after it was fired from Lebanon into Israel.

(AP/Hassan Ammar/File)As Israel continues to pound the Hezbollah terrorist movement in some of the most intense clashes since the 2006 war, United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSC) 1701is facing new criticismfor failing to disarm the Lebanon-based terrorist organization.The U.S. and other world powers passed Resolution 1701 at the United Nations Security Council in 2006 in an attempt to prevent a third war between Israel and the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah. Israel fought Hezbollah in 1982 and in the summer of 2006.Two key elements of Resolution 1701 have proved to be largely ineffective, according to experts on Lebanon and the U.N.The first part involved the 10,000 peacekeeping (with added personnel) U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that was expanded in 2006 to aid the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in assuming military control over the region, replacing Hezbollah, between the Litani River and the southern border in Lebanon.UNIFIL was tasked to work with the LAF to ensure the area was ""free of any armed personnel, assets, and weapons."" However, Hezbollah’s growing absorption of the Lebanese state has turned it the de facto ruler over the country, according to many experts, or a heavily armed ""state within a state.""The second crucial element of 1701 was to disarm Hezbollah. Yet, the Lebanese terrorist entity has dramatically re-armed itself to the point where it now has at least 150,000 missiles and rockets aimed at Israel.Smoke rises from the site of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday, Oct. 1. (AP/Hassan Ammar)North Koreaon Tuesday is accusing Israel of committing “terrorist acts against Lebanon” following its strikes targeting Hezbollah terrorists inside the country.“Israel is resorting to massacre, terrorism and assassination, talking about the ‘right to self-defense' and ‘security.’ Its brutality and shamelessness are arousing great hatred and resentment of the international community,” North Korean state media quoted a foreign ministry spokesperson as saying Tuesday.“It is a hideous war crime and unethical crime that Israel killed many civilians by committing indiscriminate military attacks and terrorist acts against Lebanon,” the spokesperson continued, describing Israel and the U.S. as “cancer-like entities of regional peace and stability and the common enemy of the Arab people.”“We strongly denounce Israel which is expanding its large-scale massacre of innocent civilians to the whole Middle East... and express invariable support and solidarity to the Arab people in their struggle for defending sovereignty, right to existence and territorial integrity,” the North Korean official added.Fox News’ Timothy H.J. Nerozzi contributed to this report.An armed Israeli Apache helicopter is seen from northern Israel, near the Israeli-Lebanon border, on Tuesday, Oct. 1. (AP/Leo Correa)Turkey’s Foreign Ministryhas released a statement Tuesdayslamming Israel’s limited ground operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, calling it an “illegal invasion attempt” that must “end immediately.”“Israel’s violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon by launching a ground attack is an illegal invasion attempt,” the Ministry said. “This attack must come to an end immediately, and Israeli troops must withdraw from Lebanese territory.”Turkey added thatIsrael’s military operation“targets the security and stability of the region and beyond.“This dangerous invasion attempt is likely to spark a new wave of migration and to give ground to extremists all around the world,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.The Ministry concluded that the U.N. Security Council “must uphold international law and take the necessary measures against this attack that aims the occupation of Lebanon.”Former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton, who hastrained Israeli soldiers,told ""Fox News @ Night"" that the Israeli military has “done a very effective job by reducing Hezbollah’s rocket infrastructure to less than 50 percent.”“Israel does feel, I’m sure, emboldened here with some momentum,” he continued. “I think they have to ensure that they keep their borders safe and we will see how long this goes.”Hamilton added that Israel wants peace and “they don’t want this conflict to continue.”The Israeli military announced Monday night that its troops began “limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon.“These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel,” the Israel Defense Forces said.A missile fired by Hezbollah landed in the central Israeli village of Kfar Qassem on Tuesday, Oct. 1, the IDF says. (IDF)TheIsrael Defense Forcesreleased a video Tuesday purportedly showing a missile that was fired by Hezbollah landing in a village in central Israel.The IDF says the projectile landed in Kfar Qassem, which is located east of Tel Aviv.“Hezbollah doesn’t care who, or how. They only care about harming Israelis,” theIDF wrote on X.The two sides have been exchanging rocket fire since Hamas launched its war on Israel on Oct. 7 last year.On Monday, Hezbollah’s second-in-command Naim Qassem said the terrorist group willcontinue to fire rockets at Israel,adding that “We know that the battle may be long,” according to Reuters.Photos of Syrians celebrating the assassination of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah last weekput the spotlighton the brutal activities of the terror group's role in sex slavery, mass starvation and kidnappings in the Syrian civil war which led to the deaths of over half a million Syrians.Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""Israel’s targeted assassination of Nasrallah last weekend has prompted greater interest in the inner workings of the Shiite terrorist organization that is widely considered the de facto ruler over Lebanon.The Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist entity is mainly known in America for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people in 1983, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut also in 1983, resulting in the murders of 241 U.S. military personnel.A new investigative video series by the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) shines a rare light on the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah’s role in sexual slavery, rape and mass murder. The shocking expose about Hezbollah’s enslavement of a Syrian woman aired days after Israel reportedly launched devastating explosions of pagers held by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon in September.CPC President Joseph Braude told Fox News Digital ""Hezbollah’s war on Israel obscures its larger war to subjugate much of the region — as a tyrant in Lebanon, an occupier in Syria, a mafia of sex and drug trafficking, and the nerve center of Iran’s Arab empire. Millions of Arabs whose lives have been shattered by the militia want a different future. Hezbollah does not want the world to hear their voices.""The Israeli Defense Forces announced Tuesday it was carrying out""limited and targeted"" raidsalong Israel's northern border against the terror group Hezbollah.The ground raids will target Hezbollah strongholds that threaten Israeli communities along the Jewish State's northern border, according to IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.Hagari said Hezbollah turned villages in Lebanon into military bases in preparation for an attack on Israel.Israeli soldiers work on tanks at a staging area in northern Israel near the Israel-Lebanon border on Tuesday, Oct. 1.

Any home used by Hezbollah for its military needs is expected to be targeted.“You must immediately head north of the Awali River. Save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately,” he added. “Be careful, you are not allowed to head south. Any head south could put your life at risk. We will let you know when it is safe to return home.”The IDF announced earlier Tuesday that it was carrying out ""limited and targeted"" raids along Israel's northern border against the terrorist group Hezbollah.The raids come after Israeli airstrikes over the last week killed multiple top members of Hezbollah, including the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.Fox News’ Landon Mion contributed to this report.Live Coverage begins here"

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/why-mideast-neighbors-wont-offer-refuge-palestinians-stuck-gaza-war-zone,Why Mideast neighbors won't offer refuge to Palestinians stuck in Gaza war zone,"Increasingly desperate Palestinian civilians appear to be stuck in the war-torn Gaza Strip, with nearby Arab countries keeping their doors firmly closed.",March 20,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane (Ret.) joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Israel's ground operations in Gaza after Hamas fighters were found in the Al-Shifa hospital and Netanyahu's criticism of Sen. Chuck Schumer's remarks.JERUSALEM –Following Secretary of State Antony Blinken's Thursday meeting with his Egyptian counterpart in Cairo, a press release noted, ""The Secretary reiterated the United States’ rejection of any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,"" and while forced displacement is not on the table, some analysts wonder why regional countries won't give, at the very minimum, temporary refuge to the Palestinians in Gaza.Images of malnourished children and desperate civilians seeking food and water in the war-tornGaza Striphave flooded both mainstream and social media channels in recent weeks and damning reports by relief organizations have accused Israel of holding up crucial aid deliveries. Yet the reaction of the international community is to force those people to keep living in an ever-worsening humanitarian situation.Requests for an explanation by Fox News Digital on this policy from both regional nations, who in the past have offered refuge to civilians escaping wars in Syria, Iraq and Sudan, and from international organizations that have galvanized to help refugees from other war-torn lands, were either met with silence or with a one-dimensional statement emphasizing that Gazans should not be forced to leave the coastal enclave.None of the responses addressed people in Gaza who are desperate to get themselves or their families out of harm’s way, even temporarily, until a cease-fire is declared. They also did not address the reality that much of Gaza’s housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed by five months of fighting and could take years to rebuild.URBAN WARFARE EXPERT SAYS ISRAELI MILITARY TAKING UNPRECEDENTED STEPS TO PROTECT GAZA CIVILIANSGazan residents and other foreign nationals wait at the Rafah border crossing in the southern Gaza Strip to enter Egypt on Nov 1, 2023.(Majdi Fathi/TPS)""We are now watching a black comedy scene where Israel is pleading with the Palestinian civilians to empty the areas where Hamas terrorists are hiding, so the Israeli forces can target them, while Arab states and even some Western powers and international organizations are urging and even forcing the Palestinian people to remain in a dangerous territory of war,"" Dalia Ziada, director of MEEM Center for Middle East and East Mediterranean Studies, told Fox News Digital.""These Arab states and international organizations will later blame Israel for carrying out disproportionate attacks in densely populated areas where Hamas terrorists are purposefully hiding among Palestinian civilians,"" she said.Ziada, an Egyptian national who was forced to flee her native Cairo after condemning Hamas for its brutal terror attack in Southern Israel on Oct. 7, said that since Israel’s creation in 1948, Arab leaders have perpetuated propaganda that accepting Palestinian refugees ""undermines the so-called Palestinian cause and will allow Israel to take control of the entire disputed territories.""From right to left, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation, Reem Ibrahim Al Hashimi, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and Secretary-General of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Hussein Al-Sheikh, pose for a group picture before their meeting in Cairo, Egypt, Thursday, March 21, 2024(AP Photo/Amr Nabil)""Recently, the narrative has changed a little to justify the rejection of receiving Palestinian refugees, especially in countries like Egypt and Jordan, which are the immediate neighbors of the current crisis,"" she said, noting that instead of allowing those fleeing the violence to enter, Egypt has claimed that opening its doors to Palestinian refugees, even temporarily, would constitute a threat to the country’s national security.Instead, the Arab country, which shares a direct border and land crossing with the Gaza Strip, has bolstered its defenses with additional soldiers and reinforced the wall along theEgypt-Gaza border.ODDS OF ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH WAR 'INEVITABLE,' EXPERTS FEAR: 'TOTALLY PESSIMISTIC'RAFAH, GAZA - MARCH 08: A view of the makeshift tents set up near the border of Egypt as Israeli attacks continue on March 08, 2024, in Rafah, Gaza.

An in-depth story published earlier this month by U.K. outlet Sky News detailed how Gazans are being charged as much as $5,000 per adult and $2,500 a child by an Egyptian travel agency, Hala, to arrange passage through the border crossing and into the safety of the Sinai Peninsula. Before the war started, it was possible to arrange travel via the agency for only $350 per person.Officially, Egypt has allowed only foreign nationals and the injured to leave Gaza since the war started in October, the report said. It noted, however, that the number of medical evacuees and foreign nationals leaving was much less than those who had paid to leave. The report said that while Hala was not listed as an official government service, all entry into Egypt is monitored by the border authority.Displaced Palestinian men watch as an Egyptian army armored personnel carrier drives near the border fence between Gaza and Egypt, on February 16, 2024 in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.(Photo by MOHAMMED ABED/AFP via Getty Images)Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative faction and a member of the Palestinian parliament in the West Bank, told Fox News Digital that charging Palestinians to leave Gaza was ""wrong"" but, he noted, the number of people who actually wanted to escape the Strip is ""very small.""Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, right, meets U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, left, at Tahrir palace in Cairo, Egypt, Thursday, March 21, 2024. Photo: AP Photo/Amr Nabil(AP Photo/Amr Nabil)""The Palestinian people do not want to be refugees again,"" he said. ""Some already became refugees in the past and they do not want to be forced out again.""""Nobody will accept the eviction of people from Gaza, this is Israel’s plan – the cleansing of Gaza – and it is something that we cannot accept,"" Barghouti said. ""The question is why Israel is not allowing sufficient aid into Gaza, why there are thousands and thousands of trucks waiting to enter? The question is why is Israel bombarding civilian areas and why has Israel destroyed our hospitals and our universities?""He also said that Israel was actively preventing injured individuals from leaving Gaza, suggesting that out of some 16,000 that needed to leave for medical treatment, only four had been permitted to leave.GAZA AID FROM US, OTHERS FALLING SHORT AS CRITICS SAY BETTER AND CHEAPER WAYS: NOBODY 'KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON'Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the Islamic Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.(AP)A spokesman for COGAT,the Israeli military authoritythat coordinates between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, told Fox News Digital that some 3,200 injured Palestinians had been permitted to leave Gaza for medical treatment since the war began.While Barghouti said that the Palestinian Authority would be willing to allow refugees from Gaza to move to the West Bank, if Israel would allow it, Arab states in the region have not been so eager to allow entry to Palestinian refugees. Some are actively even blocking it, by refusing to issue visas to Palestinian passports holders and all underscore the point that they do not want to be complicit in a forced evacuation. They speculate that Israel will not allow those who leave to return, despite comments by Israel’s foreign minister and others to the contrary.Tal Heinrich, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Fox News Digital that Israeli government policy was that ""the future of Gazan Palestinians is in Gaza.""""The Palestinians in Gaza are temporarily displaced within Gaza as a result of the war that Hamas waged on us on Oct 7,"" she said. ""Reconstruction of the strip after the elimination of Hamas should be intertwined with de-radicalization efforts of the Palestinian society.""Fahad Nazar, a spokesman for Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Washington, said his country ""rejected and condemned the forced displacement of Palestinians, who want to return to their homes and are not interested in seeking refuge in other countries.""Hundreds of families in Khan Yunis leave for Rafah in the south through a humanitarian corridor opened by the IDF, on Jan 22, 2024.(Majdi Fathi/TPS)Salman Al-Ansari, a prominent geopolitical analyst from Saudi Arabia, told Fox News Digital that the idea that Arab countries should take in Palestinian refugees ""has been misconstrued and misrepresented.""""The Saudis, Egyptians, and Jordanians know for a fact that accepting Gazans as refugees would mean an end to the Palestinians’ rights to their own lands,"" he said. ""It’s obvious that the Israeli wishful plan is to simply empty Gaza of its inhabitants. Once they are gone, they will never return.""""Throwing blame on Arab countries for their refusal to take in Palestinian refugees is nothing but a red herring,"" Al-Ansari said. ""The solution lies in not causing more death and destruction and in opening multiple and safe humanitarian corridors, establishing a truce, and most importantly, creating a clear path to ending the occupation and implementing U.N. Security Council Resolution 242.""Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani depart after a news conference at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 12 , 2021.(Olivier Douliery/Pool via Reuters)While most senior ministers in Israel’s current government have stated that Gazan civilians will be allowed to remain or return to the territory, even if the Jewish state maintains security control, some far-right members ofNetanyahu’s governmenthave made comments that Israeli settlements should be rebuilt there. Until 2005, Israel had several military bases and civilian communities in Gaza.""This far-right Israeli government harbors some delusional ideas that they can simply empty Gaza of its inhabitants by leveling the entire Gaza Strip and making it uninhabitable,"" Al-Ansari said. ""This is a very dangerous policy that could backfire on the entire region and on U.S. interests in the Middle East.""BIDEN'S VISION FOR A PALESTINIAN STATE DOOMED, EXPERTS SAY: 'AN EXPLICIT RECOGNITION OF HAMAS'Gazans and other foreign nationals wait at the Rafah border crossing on Nov 1, 2023.( Majdi Fathi/TPS)AState Departmentspokesperson told Fox News Digital that the overall goal of his trip was to ""discuss efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire agreement that secures the release of all remaining hostages, intensified international efforts to increase humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and coordination on post-conflict planning for Gaza.""Asked if he would raise the question of refuge for Gazans who want to leave, the spokesperson said Blinken had previously""made clear there should be no forceable displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.""At the United Nations, which advocates for and assists with refugees from many other war zones, Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, also said, ""Palestinians should be safe wherever they choose to be and should not be moved out of Gaza against their will.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets Jordan's King Abdullah II during a visit to Amman on Jan. 16, 2014.(Jordanian Royal Court via Getty Images)""Our focus remains on ensuring their safety and protection in Gaza, which is why the secretary-general continues to push for a humanitarian ceasefire,"" he said.Egyptian analyst Ziada said the only way to explain the indifference of Arab countries to the suffering of Palestinian civilians is that ""Arab leaders do not really want to carry the burden of rescuing them.""Smoke rises following an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip as seen from southern Israel on Dec. 1.(AP/Ariel Schalit)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""They only chose to curse Israel and sing love to the Palestinians to avoid doubling the outrage against them from their citizens, who are extremely depressed by the leaders’ political and economic failure,"" she said.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/egypt-strengthens-border-gaza-israel-continues-attacks,Egypt strengthens its border with Gaza as Israel continues attacks,"Egypt, which borders Israel and Gaza, says they ramped up security over the last two weeks, ahead of Israel's plan to expand their military operations in southern Gaza.",February 9,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"Alex Hogan reports on IDF discoveries of Hamas hideouts.Egypt has sent about 40 tanks and armored personnel carriers to northeastern Sinai within the past two weeks as part of a series of measures to bolster security on its border with Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.The deployment took place ahead of the expansion of Israeli military operations around Gaza's southern city of Rafah, where much of its population has sought safety, sharpeningEgyptian fearsthat Palestinians could be forced en masse out of the enclave.Israeli warplanes struck Rafah, which adjoins the border, on Friday and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to prepare to evacuate the displaced people.RIGHTS GROUP SLAMS EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT FOR CONVICTING EL-SISI CHALLENGER: 'CLEAR MESSAGE'Since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted on Oct. 7, Egypt constructed a concrete border wall that reaches 6.6 yards into the ground and is topped with barbed wire. It has also built berms and enhanced surveillance at border posts, the security sources said.Last month Egypt's state information service detailed some of the measures it had taken on its border in response to Israeli suggestions that Hamas had obtained weapons smuggled from Egypt. Three lines of barriers made any overground or underground smuggling impossible, it said.Images shared with Reuters by the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights, an independent group, appear to show the installation of the wall in December, with several berms running behind it.Later pictures, which the group said were taken in early February, appear to show three vertical layers of coiled barbed wire being installed on top of the wall. Reuters was not able to independently verify the images.Satellite images from January and December also show some new construction along the 13 km (8 mile) border close to Rafah and the extension of a wall to the sea's edge at its northern end.Displaced Palestinians reside alongside the Egyptian border wall.(Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Egyptian and Israeli authorities did not respond to requests for comment.The new measures come after an expansion of security in northern Sinai as Egypt's military consolidated its grip against an Islamist insurgency that escalated a decade ago.Well before the current war in Gaza broke out, Egypt said it had destroyed tunnels through which smuggling to Gaza had previously flourished, and had cleared a buffer zone close to the border.On the approach to the Rafah Crossing with Gaza, the remains of razed houses can be seen along with miles of concrete walls that have been built parallel to the sea and near roads close to the border.Egypt and Israelhave been at peace for more than four decades and in recent years have extended ties through Israeli exports of natural gas and security coordination around their shared border and the Gaza Strip.The two countries have maintained a blockade on Gaza, strictly limiting the movement of people and goods across its borders, after Hamas took control there in 2007.But the relationship has come under strain because of Israel's current military operation in Gaza, unleashed in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas.Egypt has repeatedly raised the alarm over the possibility that Israel's offensive could displace desperate Gazans into Sinai, while bristling over suggestions from Israel that it would retake full control of the Gaza-Egypt border corridor in order to ensure the Palestinian territory's demilitarization.In January, Egypt announced two operations to tackle drug smuggling in northeastern Sinai in an apparent effort to demonstrate its control of the area.An Israeli official told Reuters that restructuring of security on the border, where he said a small number of tunnels remained, was under regular discussion by the two countries.Israel would try to organize for the movement of displaced Palestinians northwards within Gaza ahead of any military operation there, the official said.Egyptian security sources have played down any discussions and said they are prioritizing efforts to reach aceasefire in Gaza. The state information service called accusations of smuggling ""lies"" intended to give cover to Israel's objective of occupying the border buffer zone, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.Egypt has also blamed Israel for limiting deliveries of aid into Gaza, where the risk of famine is growing and aid workers have warned of disease spreading.Israel has denied holding up or rejecting humanitarian supplies.Egypt has framed its opposition to the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza as part of wider Arab rejection of any repeat of what Palestinians mourn as the ""Nakba"", or ""catastrophe"", when some 700,000 fled or were forced from their homes in the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDiplomats and analysts say Egypt is also concerned about infiltration by Hamas and hosting a large refugee population.

In the statement, the president said she was ""deeply saddened"" by certain actions of the agitators, who have formed an ""encampment"" on the campus and have riled students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chants.The statement is the latest action from the school’s administration amid the fiery protests in and around the New York City campus that began Wednesday as dozens of anti-Israel activists created an encampment on the main lawn of campus.COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT ORDERS VIRTUAL CLASSES AS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS TAKE OVER: 'WE NEED A RESET'Students at Columbia University returned to the campus’ lawn area on Friday morning to continue their anti-Israel protest and say they will ""hold this line"" until their demands are met.(FNTV)See the dramatic moments on the campus from Columbia University anti-Israel protests.On Wednesday, dozens of protesters called on the university to divest itself from companies that have ties to Israel.

Some things that were said at those protests and on social media were profoundly unsettling and frightening,"" Shafik wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Tuesday.

But as a peace deal continues to evade the war in Gaza, Harris has declined to answer questions on whether the U.S. could use its soft power in halting weapons shipments to a top ally in the Middle East to affect policy change under her leadership.Last week, Harris was pressed on whether she would do anything differently from President Biden with Israel and the war in Gaza. She answered in the negative, but quickly pivoted to the need for a peace deal.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request from Fox News Digital on whether halting weapons shipments would be on or off the table if Harris takes the White House.Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, speaks at a campaign rally at the Enmarket Arena on Aug. 29, 2024 in Savannah, Ga.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)""President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-israels-war-survival,Morning Glory: Israel’s war of survival,"The only way to understand Israel's war in Gaza is to rely on the right experts. The legacy media can't be counted on, so here is an essential set of resources to get behind the scenes.",April 1,2024-10-15,Israel War,Fox News,Middle East,"Fox News' Trey Yingst provides details on the strike that Lebanese security sources claim killed a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader and explains the possibility of a response from Iran.Do you know what you are talking about when you opine onIsrael’s war of survival?""Give me five minutes with a person's checkbook,"" the late Billy Graham remarked, ""and I will tell you where their heart is.""That famous dictum is no longer true because… who uses checkbooks? But a modern corollary is now applicable: ""Show me the podcasts you follow in your feed and actually listen to, and I’ll tell you whether you are genuinely informed about ____.""CAPTURED HAMAS TERRORISTS SAY GROUP IS 'COLLAPSING FROM WITHIN,' SAYS ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTERPodcasts have become an alternative to news programs—network, cable or on the radio—and to newspapers. Sports pods came first as fans of specific franchises are ""super consumers"" of news and analysis of the clubs they follow. My feed is full of Cleveland sports for example: ""Terry’s Talkin’"" with Terry Pluto and David Campbell of Cleveland.com, along with ""Orange and Brown Talk"" and ""Buckeye Talk"" from the same platform with different hosts who cover the Cleveland Browns and The Ohio State University Buckeyes football have been in my podcast feed the longest.An Israeli soldier on top of a tank on the border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Sunday, March 17, 2024.(AP)Also on the feed is the relatively new ""Kings of the North"" pod, hosted by Doug Lesmaires and Bill Landis, which has forged a concept that ""northern"" college football deserved its own pod—as opposed to, say, dreaded SEC pods that don’t understand that the best college football is played north of Tennessee. It’s quite entertaining, as well as my other regular sports pods. That’s what the best sports pods are: entertaining and informative.Of political and general news pods, there are now thousands competing with sports pods. I enjoy ""Getting Hammered"" with Mary Katharine Ham and Vic Matus because it is funny and topical, and I feel like I am listening in to conversations my adult children might be having. It does cover some news, but mostly it provides a dive into the informed perspectives on the news of a different age cohort.But if the subject you are interested in is Israel’s war in Gaza, and quite likely the imminent, much expandedbattle between the IDF and Hezbollahon the northern border of the Jewish state, you have to be much more selective.Thus, I have become a daily listener to the Times of Israel’s The Daily Briefing (especially when the platform’s senior analyst Haviv Rettig Gur is a guest) and it’s ""What Matters Now"" pod which also often features Rettig Gur, who has become something of a must-listen to interpreter of the war for non-Israelis.I discovered Rettig Gur on the ""Call Me Back"" podcast hosted by Dan Senor, a pod on which Senor interviews key observers of the war in Gaza and the likelihood of another front that exploded in intensity in the north. Senor is an American who seems to know pretty much every journalist and many officials in Israel.Senor’s March 21 interview of Israeli War Cabinet member Ron Dermer was perhaps the first ""strategic"" pod I have listened to. Dermer quite obviously had many messages to deliver from the War Cabinet to the American public that supports Israel’s war. He picked Senor’s pod because he wanted to speak to that audience specifically. It was a wise choice. Senor is a seasoned interviewer but, in this episode, like almost every other episode, Senor is eliciting information, not dealing out his opinions.Finally, I’m not Jewish, but I am also not blind to the surge in antisemitism in the United States to truly staggering levels, so I make a habit of listening to every ""Commentary"" pod that appears as well as relevant ones from The Free Press, the platform pioneered by Bari Weiss which has exploded in popularity as an alternative to legacy media.The latter is usually a new take with a new voice on most episodes, but the Commentary pod has a recurring format: Editor-in-chief of Commentary Magazine John Podhoretz leads a daily conversation with his Executive Editor Abe Greenwald and two or three of his key contributors—Matt Continetti, Seth Mandel and Christine Rosen—through every aspect of Israel’s war and its impact on Jewish Americans of the antisemitic Krakatoa that went off in the states after 10/7, as well as a good mix of domestic American politics as campaign 2024 heads into its third turn.Bari Weiss launched The Free Press, an important alternative to the legacy media.(Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)What ""JPod,"" as Podhoretz is known online and off, does is simply run through the current developments with his gang of very, very smart voices—say, a focus on the abstention of the U.S. on last week’s Security Council Resolution decoupling a ceasefire from release of the hostages or on the views of American Jewry on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Commentary pod also welcomes guests like Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, Eli Lake or Eliana Johnson. They also welcome—wait for it—the remarkable Rettig Gur now and again.Finally, I make a point to listen to Donniel Hartman, 66, and Yossi Klein Halevi, 71, on their ""For Heaven’s Sake"" pod, whenever it appears, because these are two very smart old Israeli friends who are public intellectuals of great reputation in Israel who seem to me to be left and center-left (and both anti-Netanyahu) and thus certain to introduce me to some Israeli thinking that isn’t necessarily going to make it into news reports I ordinarily read. They also represent voices from my age cohort with references throughout to their 50-plus years of Israeli history and politics.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBottom line, I’d have half as many facts and views of the war if I only listened to two of these four podcasts focused mostly on Israel’s war of survival. If I relied only on American legacy media, I would have a terribly distorted view of the war and would be blind and dumb to vast amounts of crucial data about the war.Thus, on Friday’s night ""Special Report""—Gillian Turner sitting in for Bret Baier—the ""Winners and Losers of the Week"" segment came up, and I rattled off these pods as the ""winners of the week"" because of their collective coverage of this terrible but necessary war. I recommend all four of them to you because so much of the coverage of the war in Gaza and what seems likely to be a war in Lebanon requires a lot of information and assessment that most reporters and pundits simply don’t have the time to acquire.Give me five minutes with your podcast feed, and I’ll know not just your passions, but probably your point of view on politics generally and whether or not you are in a position to even articulate an informed opinion on the war that Israel is waging. Give them all a try. Start, perhaps with Senor’s conversation with Dermer from last week and his latest interview or Rettig Gur which posted early Monday morning in the U.S.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI would be happy to listen to a pod that was news from the Palestinian point of view, but I am afraid there just isn’t anything that can be relied on given Hamas’ stranglehold on Gaza’s Arab population. If you have a suggestion, leave it in the comments. I’ll give any serious pod a chance. But if you are an American journalist or elected official who is commenting on the war without reference to the Israeli point of view—not just the government’s positions and statements but the Israeli public’s almost completely United attitude towards the war—perhaps say nothing until you are least informed of the facts in Gaza and on the northern border. To get those facts, you are going to have to go in harms way and out of your American news comfort zones.Try it. You may not change your mind, but at least you will be less in danger of holding a risible opinion untethered to the reality of the situation in Israel.Hugh Hewitt is one of the country’s leading journalists of the center-right.

But, under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has succeeded in mitigating the threat of Hamas by destroying its tunnel infrastructure and taking out its leaders. Israel is also successfully degrading Hezbollah in the north by eliminating its senior leadership and launching a targeted operation in southern Lebanon with the goal of pushing the group north of the Litani River and reducing the threat the terrorist organization poses to our northern border.""Danon, who is a member of Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, added, ""While we are making progress, there is still work to be done.

His right-wing coalition government had suffered public humiliation when his administration was forced toabandon its judicial reform planbecause of massive civil society protests.Now, with a string of tactical victories over Hezbollah and Hamas' top leaders, including Israeli control over most of the Gaza Strip, Bibi, as he is known in Israel by his nickname, has gained popularity in political polling.""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah.

That is why you see him rising in the polls. He is the only one to use the term victory. You don’t hear that from the security establishment."" He cited the examples of Bibi’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Herzi Halevi , the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who ""are not talking about a complete defeat of Hamas.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a joint meeting of Congress in the chamber of the House of Representatives at the U.S. Capitol on July 24, 2024.(Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The veteran Israeli commentator said Israel’s seizure of the southern Gaza city of Rafah was a telling example of a clash between Bibi and his war planners, Gallant and Halevi. There was hesitation on the part of Gallant and Halevi while Netanyahu wanted to expedite the capture of Rafah, the last major holdout of sizeable Hamas terrorist forces. Kahana chalked up a possible explanation of delay from Gallant and Halevi to the Biden administration’s interference in havingexpressed opposition to the IDF operationin Rafah.After a four-month offensive in Rafah, the IDF, in September, declared victory over Hamas’ Rafah brigade.

He compared Bibi to Britain’s WWII prime minister, Winston Churchill, who demanded that his army do certain things but encountered resistance.

America’s Newsroom anchor Bill Hemmer looks back at the top headlines of the past 12 months.Hamas’ surprise terror attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 launched a war and completely upended theglobal news cyclefor the remainder of the year, dividing newsrooms from both editorial and ideological viewpoints.The Hamas terror attacks, which targeted women, children and the elderly, along with Israel’s forceful response, have sparked rallies, protests and even bouts of antisemitism across America, from higher learning institutions to the streets of major cities. Prominent news organizations were no different, with cable news outlets and major newspapers seeing colleagues disagree.TheNew York Timeshas seen an assortment of issues related to the Israel-Hamas war, taking heat from both sides as many pro-Israel Americans have dismissed the Gray Lady as anti-Israel but pro-Palestinian protesters have targeted the paper’s Manhattan headquarters to demand a cease-fire in Gaza.NEW YORK TIMES ACCUSED OF 'BOTH-SIDING' PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTORS TEARING DOWN POSTERS OF KIDNAPPED CIVILIANSThe New York Times has seen an assortment of issues related to the Israel-Hamas war.(Reuters/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo)New York Times Magazine poetry editor Anne Boyer resigned even last month in protest of what she called Israel's ""U.S-backed war against the people of Gaza."" Her decision came after now-former colleague, NYT Magazine writer Jazmine Hughes, stepped down after she was reportedly reprimanded for signing an open letter declaring Israel was guilty of ""apartheid and genocide.""The open letter actually called out The New York Times by name, blasting its editorial board for writing ""what Israel is fighting to defend is a society that values human life and the rule of law.""Signing the letter was in violation of the paper's public protest policies. Fellow Times writer Jamie Lauren Keiles also resigned after signing the letter. But while a handful of staffers have ditched the Times in support of the Palestinian people, some observers feel the paper favors Palestinians.The Times, which has long been accused of an anti-Israel tilt by certain critics, was accused of ""both-siding"" pro-Palestinian protesters tearing down posters of civilian hostages. The New York Post editorial board even scolded crosstown paper Times, accusing the Gray Lady of downplaying antisemitism in the process.The Times also took heat for inaccurately reporting that Israeli airstrikes caused an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds last month. Israel quickly denied the claims and presented evidence that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad was behind the blast and U.S. intelligence ultimately confirmed that Israel was not behind the explosion.WASHINGTON POST PULLED ANTI-HAMAS POLITICAL CARTOON AMID 'DEEP CONCERNS' FROM STAFFERSThe Times soon releaseda lengthy editor’s noteapologizing for its reliance on unverified claims by Hamas.Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that some Times staffers ""chafed when the NewsGuild held a virtual meeting during which some members debated the merits of issuing a statement calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to U.S. government aid to Israel, a move that they said would compromise their neutrality and put colleagues in war zones at risk.""The Journal also noted that NewsGuild President Jon Schleuss ""said the union hadn’t considered issuing such a statement,"" but admitted to having a meeting ""to listen to its hundreds of members who wanted the union to issue a statement, as well as to people who opposed it,"" which essentially confirmed infighting by the paper’s staff.Over at the Washington Post, there was internal uproar over a political cartoon that mocked the terrorist group Hamas.The Post cartoon titled ""Human shields"" depicted a Hamas spokesperson saying, ""How dare Israel attack civilians,"" while a frightened-looking woman and four small children remain bound with rope to his body. The cartoon was featured in the Nov. 8 print edition of the paper and online, which was later deleted upon viral backlash. The paper's executive editor Sally Buzbee addressed staffers after she noticed ""deep concerns and conversations"" in the newsroom.The Los Angeles Times saw some staffers sign an open letter criticizing ""Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians,"" only to reportedly get told they wouldn’t be able to cover the war as a result.MSNBC was forced to deny a report that Mehdi Hasan was ""quietly"" removed from the anchor chair, insisting it was a coincidental move to focus on breaking coverage. But Hasan, who formerly worked for Al Jazeera, has been one of the strongest critics of Israel in the mainstream media during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and saw his show get canceled by the network weeks later, although MSNBC insists it was simply a programming decision.NEW YORK POST EDITORIAL BOARD ACCUSES NYT OF DOWNPLAYING ANTISEMITISM: PAPER DOES 'NOT WANT YOU WORRYING'Hearst, amedia companythat owns Esquire, Cosmopolitan and other major brands, reportedly told employees to be careful about ""controversial"" statements after a senior fashion editor commented on the Israel-Hamas war. Lizz Schumer, a senior editor and union shop steward at Good Housekeeping, told the Washington Post, ""It feels like a drastic overreach on the part of our parent company.""Across the pond, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) initially referred to the organization as ""freedom fighters,"" ""gunmen"" or ""militants"" rather than terrorists. As the situation escalated into a war,viewers became increasingly frustratedwith the news organization’s refusal to use the term ""terrorists,"" particularly after reports of Hamas’ brutal actions against civilians.Although the BBC originally defended its decision, claiming ""terrorism is a loaded word,"" the network eventually did an about-face and started calling Hamas a ""terrorist organization.""Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said he held private conversations with CNN and MSNBC about their coverage of Israel after scolding the networks on the air and urging news organizations around the world to do a better job covering the Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7.""I've called out the coverage on CNN while I was being interviewed on CNN. I've called out the coverage on MSNBC while I was being interviewed on MSNBC,"" Greenblatt previously told Fox News Digital.""All of them need to do better. They need to do better because this isn't just about antisemitism, although it is. The carelessness with which they treat Jewish victims is crazy,"" he continued. ""This isn't just about Israel, although it is. Demonizing and dehumanizing Israelis and Zionists is how you get this kind of barbarism and these atrocities. This is about humanity.""Greenblatt scolded MSNBC on ""Morning Joe"" the Monday following the Hamas terror attacks, bluntly asking, ""Who's writing the scripts?"" His remarks came after several MSNBC hosts and pundits referred to Hamas as fighters and militants. ""I’m looking right at the camera, they are terrorists,"" he told MSNBC viewers.While on MSNBC, Greenblatt also begged the network and their liberal viewers to ""get this story right"" because of the magnitude of the conflict.""Please stop calling this a retaliation. This is a defensive measure against an organization that is committed to one thing, killing Jews. Not a peaceful resolution of a conflict. But murdering Jews,"" he said. ""And if you’re wondering if I’m exaggerating, please, I beg of you, everyone watching, and everyone at this network: Just watch the footage.""He appeared on CNN the day after the brutal terror attack and took exception to CNN International anchor Becky Anderson's choice of adjectives when describing Hamas. While the CNN interview was on the phone and didn't generate the headlines that his MSNBC comments received, the ADL leader didn't exactly hold back.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Hamas should be seen as the hate group that it is. A hate group that’s been promoting an ideology of hate for years. Dehumanizing Jewish people and dehumanizing the Jewish state. As we’ve seen in America and around the world, when you dehumanize people, you create the conditions, you brainwash the public into thinking acts of dehumanization is permissible,"" Greenblatt told CNN viewers.""You need to tell Becky Anderson to stop using words like ‘spectacular’ to describe the terror organization of Hamas. Stop saying they made great gains, spectacular gains,"" he continued. ""We should call these people the barbarians that they are, and we should recognize that the only words to use in the context of this are ‘criminal’ and ‘homicidal.’ Those are the only adjectives that apply.""Fox News’ Joseph A.

""You both must ensure that any error, like your abandonment of Israel at the United Nations Security Council in March 2024, is not repeated when dealing with these accusations.""Critics charged Biden with abandoning Israel and the hostages taken by Hamas amid the administration’s failure late last month to veto a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution calling for a cease-fire, putting further strain on the administration's relationship with America's closest ally in the Middle East.""Any misguided attempt by the ICC to prosecute leaders of the Israeli government in the midst of that nation’s justified defensive war against Hamas terrorists would be extraordinarily troubling, and I am calling on President Biden and the entire administration to do everything possible to defend our Israeli allies and demand the ICC investigate the proponents of the Oct. 7 terror attack,"" D'Esposito said in a statement to Fox News Digital.Tuesday’s letter notes that the ICC has never been recognized by any presidential administration and neither the United States nor Israel have ever been a part of the court empaneled in The Hague, Netherlands.""If the Court does decide to move forward with these sham prosecutions, based on accusations leveled by terrorist organizations and corrupt foreign governments,"" the three Republicans from New York warned ""there must be consequences"" and called on the Biden administration to ""consider the harshest punishments for those involved with this prosecution if they do move forward.""ISRAEL IS CONCERNED ICC COULD ISSUE ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST NETANYAHU, SENIOR OFFICIALS: REPORTHouse Republicans urged President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to pressure the ICC against issuing warrants for Israeli officials.(Getty Images)""The leadership of our greatest ally stands falsely accused of war crimes, ranging from disproportionate force to deliberately starving the Palestinian civilians within the Gaza Strip,"" the letter says. ""These accusations cannot be further from the truth. The civilian casualty ratio reported during these ongoing operations in the Gaza Strip is one of the lowest in any instance of urban warfare. That remains true even if you believe the figures coming from the Gaza Health Ministry.""The lawmakers said Israel has attempted to allow ""as much well-vetted humanitarian aid in as possible under the current security situation, accompanied by direct aid deliveries from the United States and our allies"" and asserted ""with attacks by terrorist groups within Gaza on thehumanitarian aid pierbeing constructed by United States military personnel, the ICC should consider who really does not want aid reaching the civilian population.""""There must not be any false equivalencies made between Israel and the barbaric terrorist organizations like Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the other members of the Palestinian Joint Operations Room who directly targeted and massacred Israeli civilians on October 7th, 2023,"" the letter says. ""In its operations in the Gaza Strip, Israel has attempted to minimize civilian casualties. In their terrorist attacks in Israel, members of the Palestinian Joint Operations Room did everything possible to maximize civilian harm.""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that the ICC could be issuing a warrant for war crimes against him in the coming days.(LEO CORREA/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)CRITICS CHARGE BIDEN WITH ABANDONING ISRAEL, HOSTAGES AMID GROWING TENSIONS WITH JEWISH STATEEsposito, Stefanik and Molinaro told the Biden administration that the United States ""must continue to pressure the ICC to prevent any of these warrants being issued for members of the Israeli government.""READ THE LETTER –APP USERS, CLICK HERE:""The ICC’s time and resources would be much better spent prosecuting the leadership ofterrorist groups in the Gaza Strip, who sit in lavish apartment blocks in Qatar, far away from the conflict, whose members have been well documented engaging in war crimes on October 7th,"" the letter says. ""If they do decide to move forward with these arrest warrants, it is our hope that the administration will stand with our ally Israel, reject any attempts to execute these warrants, and enforce severe consequences on those engaged in this sham prosecution.

But we didn't because the emotion of fear took our culture and changed it into something that we would never have accepted and most likely, never have recognized.RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATESToday, when it comes toUkraineand theRussianinvasion of Ukraine, I can see that we're headed down a similar path. Here's what I mean: This time we're not driven by fear; we're driven more by empathy. We see horrible images go across our social media feed or on our television screen. We see civilian lives, loss of life. We see absolute travesties that warrant, at some point, a discussion of war crimes. And we're driven by empathy to do something. You can't let this continue. We have to do something. And by the way, the emotion of fear is playing a role as well because we sit here and not irrationally fear whatVladimir Putin's next move may be.I want to be clear about something: I'm not telling you that I believe emotion has no role in life. In fact, as I've gotten older, I've actually started to appreciate more the role of emotion. There was probably a time when I thought rationality and logic and turning ourselves into essentially automated robots was the best way to achieve a just society. I was wrong. Logic is cold. It has its role, and you can tell anyone who listens to this knows I lean heavily on logic.But I've also come to understand sometimes that the world operates by very simple emotions – fear, strength, weakness, courage. I know that not only is the world explained by emotion, but emotion is important. It makes life richer. It can't be all black and white. It brings out the colors, and sometimes even though something is irrational, that's part of being human. That's part of this life.But when it comes to making a decision about whether or not to go to war, one that could result in nuclear war, one whose costs could be incalculable, I do want to be as rational as possible. Emotion, empathy, the humanitarian cause, the pleas of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the words in our mind that carry such heavy impact —  words like freedom, the concept of the underdog – they all lurk, playing on the irrational decision. But I don't think we can give in to it. I don't think we should just do something.I mean, let's just put into context what that kind of irrationality leads to, how that kind of irrationality is a false North Star. I don't hear many calls right now for us to do something inSyria. In Syria, little children are gassed. Chemical weapons. Chemical warfare. They die. They're disfigured. People die by the thousands in Syria because there's a civil war between separatists and Bashar al-Assad, the authoritarian dictator in Syria, who, by the way, is backed by Vladimir Putin, who's being funded and given weapons and supported by Russia.A Ukrainian serviceman aims towards Russian positions outside the city of Brovary, east of Kyiv, on March 9, 2022.((Photo by ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images))And oh, by the way, one more time: This travesty, these war crimes, this horrible, horrible loss of human life has been going on for over a decade, but we haven't been compelled by our media. Our brains haven't given into images to just do something. Why? And don't think Syria and Ukraine are the only places in the world where horrible things are happening. But I want to be clear about something: That doesn't mean we don't do something even if we don't do it everywhere. I don't believe that. I don't think just pointing out our inconsistency says, well, throw up your hands – don't do anything.It just means, hey, recognize we may not be living in the land of principle. We may not be living in the land of reason and logic. On the other side — and it's weird how political lines are totally scattered right now – I can hear from those on the right who say, ""What are you so afraid of? Why are you such a coward? Why does Vladimir Putin scare you so much? We got to go get him.""I think it's worth setting aside for a moment, in our own decision-making, about putting American interests first.And look, even though I used that voice, I don't blow off that kind of mindset, either. I love that America irrationally has an empathetic streak to help people, even when we don't help everyone. I also love that America irrationally sometimes just wants to kick some ass and do the right thing. But I know that those are instincts. I don't want to rip them out of the human experience. But I also want them to have the steering wheel.You can't just go marching boots into Ukraine. You can't impose a no-fly zone. You have to go through the process of the dominoes of warfare playing out, and you have to try to get inside the mind of your opponent. You do it if you're playing chess, you would do it if you were on the basketball court. You would do it if you're on the offensive line facing a defensive lineman.You would try to get into the mind of your opponent. What will they do? Will he try a spin move? Which way is he going to cross over, left or right? You would ask yourself what you have to guard, not just to play defense, so that you know how and when to play offense, and you have to do the same thing in warfare.CLICK BELOW TO LISTEN TO THE FULL EPISODE OF ""THE WILL CAIN PODCAST"":What would make Vladimir Putin launch a conventional war against a narrow country?

Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of approximately 7,000 additional U.S. troops to Germany in a move aimed at bolstering NATO defense and deterring Russian aggression.The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee the country. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.After several hours of fierce battle, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday raised concerns of repeated of the 1986 disaster.A senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Thursday that Putin’s goal appears to be seizing the capital of Kyiv, ""decapitating the government"" and ""installing his own method of governance.""He claimed Putin indicated this himself during his overnight speech.RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATESAccording to the U.S. Embassy Riga, U.S. troops from the Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in Latvia Thursday morning. They were the first U.S. forces being repositioned to the Baltics to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to Allies and bolster NATO’s eastern flank.Satellite images show developments of Russian invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022.

A third axis in the south is spreading from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to the Ukrainian city of Kherson.Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, called for Russia to be removed from SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, and for allies to support them through devastating financial sanctions against Russia, through defensive anti-air supplies, and by cutting all diplomatic ties with Russia.Recognizing Ukraine is not a member of NATO, Markarova said she did not expect U.S. troops to defend Ukraine but expected other support give their ""strategic friendship.""RUSSIA CRACKS DOWN ON ANTI-WAR PROTESTS, MORE THAN 1,700 DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTEDBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine before the House of Commons Thursday and moved to freeze assets of Russian banks. He announced the ""largest ever"" set of sanctions against Russia and vowed to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas.Anti-Russian demonstrations have popped up across Europe and in the U.S. in cities including New York, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris and Berlin. Meanwhile, Russian authorities began cracking down on anti-war protests across the country, reportedly arresting more than a thousand demonstrators in several cities.Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country severed diplomaticrelations with Russiaand called ""on all our partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of aggression in Europe since WWII.""While the attack on Ukraine was largely condemned by the West, it’s unclear whether forces will intervene, somethingRussian President Vladimir Putinwarned would show grave consequences. NATO is sending additional forces to bolster defenses in eastern Europe.Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attack on the country, The Associated Press reported. Several dozen people have been wounded. He didn’t specify whether casualties included civilians.Zelenskyy said he would be providing weapons to citizens who want to help defend the country, instructing them on Twitter to ""be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE IN LARGEST EUROPEAN ATTACK SINCE WWII""The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian,"" he said Thursday, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry’s assembly facilities.Russia ""has embarked on a path of evil,"" the president said, but Ukraine ""is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks."" Zelenskyy said sanctions would be lifted ""on all citizens of Ukrainewho are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.""The attacks came first from the air. Later, Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.In the north, video showed tanks rolling over the border from the Russian ally of Belarus through Senkivka.

The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.Western counties were anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to flee from the attack on Ukraine, Reuters reported.

Russian missiles also targeted several Ukrainian cities, and explosions could be heard before dawn in the capital of Kyiv, home to 3 million people.After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoringRussia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATOand for security guarantees.In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin said ""no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.""Among Putin’s pledges was to ""denazify"" Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/reporters-notebook-ukraine-war-one-year-on-human-tragedies-and-triumphs,"Reporter's Notebook: Ukraine war one year on, human tragedies and triumphs",Senior Fox News foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reviews a year of reporting from the frontlines of Russia's war against Ukraine.,"February 21, 2023",2024-10-15,Ukraine War,Fox News,Ukriane,"Fox News' senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on the conditions in Ukraine after a Russian strike knocked out power and water in Kyiv.One year intoRussia’s war in Ukraineand the media is full of anniversary stories detailing all the geopolitical dynamics of the situation. For me, looking back at our trips to Ukraine this past year, it’s the personal stories that stand out…as well as how my own life got intertwined with the tales of combat.Our first trip to Kyiv was during the tense run-up to the invasion last January and February. It was a time of mixed messages. The U.S. was declaring, including in a backgrounder we got at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, that Moscow was going to attack. Various expert analysts told us the same thing. Right to the brink though, including at a press conference we were at,President Volodymyr Zelenskyywas being cagey. He’d later say he didn’t want to spook the public.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a press conference before the war started in Kyiv, Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News.)Senior foreign affairs correspondent for Fox News Channel Greg Palkot reporting from a snowy Kyiv, Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)But the public was getting the message. One cold Saturday before the invasion, we spent time with dozens of locals in a woody suburb of Kyiv, learning all there was to know about crawling under barbed wire…dodging bullets…and applying first aid. Some of which they used on me after I slipped down an icy hill and smashed my glasses into my face!Shortly after that, I would get my own chilling news.My dear father, at the grand age of 108, had passed away. This cut short my trip to Ukraine in order to get back to New York for his funeral. Maybe appropriate, though, that this happened in the midst of news-gathering. Dad long ago instilled in me a passion for current events. When I went to the den in his home, I found the latest issue of the Economist magazine open to a story about Ukraine.Greg Palkot with his later father Ed.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Training session on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, as locals get ready for the war.BIDEN CHALLENGES PUTIN TO 'END THE WAR' IN UKRAINE, THREATENS TO RAMP UP SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIAWhich brings me to Feb 24, 2022. No, I wasn’t on the frontline of the invasion. I was in my pajamas in the dining room of our home in London in the early hours of the morning. I was getting the latest on every amazing detail of Vladimir Putin’s attack via a What’sApp group we had started in Kyiv earlier. Most important were the messages from our local producer24 year-old Sasha Kuvshynova. I passed them on to Fox News via a mass email group. In those early confusing days Sasha was an invaluable source of information for the network and our viewers.Sasha Kuvshynova kept us updated in the early days of the invasion.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Naturally, I was anxious to get back in the mix, and two weeks later I was in Lviv, Ukraine. Even though it was on the far western side of the country, it too was impacted by Moscow’s offensive actions, including a base hit by Russian missiles. It was used by the U.S. and otherNATO countriesto instruct Ukrainian military. Now, it was as a training center for international volunteers. Nearby residents told us how shocked they were to see rockets screaming overhead.On the way back to Lviv, I rang my dear friend and cameraman through thick and thin for the last 20y years,Pierre Zakrzewski. He was in Kyiv working with correspondents and friendsBenjamin Halland Trey Yingst, covering the incursions by Russian forces into the suburbs of the capital. They were reporting on the first waves of death, destruction and terror heaped on the Ukrainian people by Moscow. Pierre, as always, was deep in the mix. It would be the last time we’d speak.Sasha Kuvshynova and Pierre Zakrzewski in Kyiv, Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall was injured outside Kyiv while in the field covering Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.(Fox News)Because on the next day, as were preparing for live shots at our Lviv hotel, my producer Baz Davies walked into the room and said, ""I’ve got some news that will change your life."" Reporter Hall, cameraman Zakrzewski and producer Kuvshynova were all missing after a Russian missile attack. We would learn, the next day the first was badly injured. The other two…killed.REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ONCE-LIVELY UKRAINE CITY TURNS NEARLY SILENTMy sign offs during the lives that night were essentially…Sad time for Ukraine…and a sad day for Fox News. At a proper Irish funeral in Dublin for Pierre the following week…we would lift several glasses. For those we lost. And the country that was under attack.A memorial honoring Pierre Zakrzewski in Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)A memorial honoring Sasha Kuvshynova.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)And yes, the battle did go on. Remarkably, the Ukrainians were fighting back with clever tactics and daring deeds. Crucially pushing the Russian troops back and away from the outskirts of Kyiv and driving them across the border as Putin’s ill-planned push to topple the Ukrainian leadership stumbled.By the time we got there on my next trip to Ukraine in late April and May, it was quieter around Kyiv, but the scars were still there and the healing hadn’t really started.UKRAINIAN TOWN DEFIES THE RUSSIANS AS RESIDENTS COME HOME AND VOW, 'WE WILL WIN'A rainbow covers the road in Lviv, Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Greg Palkot and the Fox News team in Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)We went to Bucha, one of the hardest-hit towns by Russian fighters and saw….a long smoothed-over patch of dirt next to the main church where bodies had been buried in a mass grave. We visited a long residential street…eerily still that day…a shooting gallery for Russian mercenaries a few weeks back. And spoke with residents still breaking down in tears over the horror heaped on them.And we went to Borodyanka. Made infamous for a long apartment building. With the middle gashed out of it by Russian shelling…a statue to a Ukrainian poet with a bullet through its tin head…shops with their fronts knocked out. In many cases, we were told it was brave locals who stood up and fended off a first wave of Russian attacks. Only to get battered by nasty revenge attacks days later.A mass grave in Bucha, May 30, 2022(Andrew Fone/Fox News)An aerial view shows a residential building destroyed by shelling, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Borodyanka in the Kyiv region, Ukraine March 3, 2022.(REUTERS/Maksim Levin/File Photo)A Ukrainian serviceman walks by a destroyed apartment building in Borodyanka, Ukraine, Wednesday, April 6, 2022.(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)Throughout these trips we spoke with a lot of folks. Some innocents caught in the fire. Some helping to lead this young brave democracy. People like 26-year-old Sviat Yurash. He was our local producer during the early protests and Russian attacks in 2014. He would become the youngest member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He became famous as images of his lanky frame walking patrols around Kyiv, a long gun slung over his shoulder spread around the world.Now, he was doing duty back and forth between the front lines with a dog he rescued from the rubble of one Russian attack. His spirit intact. Confident like so many we spoke with that Ukraine would beat back the horrid Moscow land grab.REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: 'SHOCKING' RUSSIAN MISSILES HIT THE REGIONGreg Palkot and Sviat Yurash in Ukraine, November 2022A power cut in Kyiv, Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Greg Palkot filming a standup in the dark of Kyiv with his cameraman.(Fox News)Greg Palkot standing by a bombed out building hit by Russian missiles.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Still the war went on. Offensives and counter-offensives. By the time we returned in October and November, Kyiv had gained back more ground, but Moscow had a new tactic. It couldn’t win on the battlefield, so it would strike civilians. Or at least the infrastructure supporting regular folks. Power stations, power lines, water pumping stations, phone and internet relay stations.That became the weekly drill.Air raid sirens. A distant or not so distant rumble. Then emergency teams racing to a site. Which we raced to. To record the damage. And hear from people recounting projectiles falling around them. And then being left without vital essentials. A one-two Putin punch.A cemetery we visited in the heart of Kyiv also told the tale. Long rows of fresh graves a symbol of the massive toll of this war. We spoke with a mother who lost her son. A couple who lost a friend. Two others who were missing a colleague. Young and old. Black and white family photos. Teddy bears. Football scarves. Bits of life. Turned to death.A cemetery in Kyiv, Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Long rows of fresh graves a symbol of the massive toll of this war.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Long rows of fresh graves a symbol of the massive toll of this war.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)A funeral service at St. Michael's Monastery in Kyiv.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)We were in Kyiv for our Thanksgiving. For all their suffering and struggle, the staffers at our hotel prepared a turkey meal that would be prized on any American table. On this day of transplanted American warmth, I thought back on my own losses. In addition to my father dying in the past year, I also lost his last remaining sibling, 92-year-old Aunt Mildred. And his long-time girlfriend, 96-year-old Alice.REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: LEAVING UKRAINE AFTER THE 'BEST AND WORST OF TIMES'Also always on our minds, the loss of Pierre and Sasha. We stopped a few times during our reporting to see the exact spot where Russian missiles stole their lives. All that’s left…some ugly divots and spray marks from shrapnel on the side of the road. Flowers and memorial cards left. What was positive, though, the remarkable recovery of Benjamin Hall from terrible wounds. We had a warm reunion upon our return from the latest trip.Benjamin Hall with the Fox News London bureau team.(Fox News)And so back to this first anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. And what lies ahead. Frankly, not even us grizzled war correspondents know for sure. What seems likely is thatVladimir Putinwill not give up. He has set himself on a road to a brutal take-over and until he comes close to achieving something, he’ll continue to throw his cannon fodder into the ugly mix.So far, the U.S. and international allies don’t look like they’re giving up either. Most countries seem willing to up the ante. Though there are worrying signs, including in the U.S., of flagging enthusiasm.A young family stand next to a burnt out car in Kyiv.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Greg Palkot interviewing an elderly grandmother in Ukraine.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, awards a serviceman at the site of the heaviest battles with the Russian invaders in Bakhmut, Ukraine, Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2022.(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)Ukrainians inspect a Russian tank in Kyiv.From what we have seen in the past year, witnessed on the ground, and heard from everyone the country and its people will not give up until the Russians are driven out.(Greg Palkot/Fox News)As for the people of Ukraine. From what we have seen in the past year, witnessed on the ground, and heard from everyone from President Zelenskyy down to a lovely 89-year-old granny, the country and its people will not give up until the Russians are driven out. Sadly, though, that could take a lot of hard doing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGreg Palkot currently serves as a London-based senior foreign affairs correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).

The revolving door of leadership allowed the charismatic Prigozhin to establish control, leading to a highly controversial policy that allowed him to recruit directly from Russia’s prisons to reinforce his Wagner Group.PUTIN HOPES FOR ‘MORE CONSTRUCTIVE’ US PRESIDENT IN INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE, WARNS AMERICA MUST ‘BE CAREFUL’Ukrainian servicemen ride atop an armoured fighting vehicle Tuesday as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues at an unknown location in Eastern Ukraine.(Press service of the Ukrainian Ground Forces/Handout via REUTERS)Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who took command of the Russian forces in January, cut off Prigozhin from his access to prisons and much-needed munitions.

Lukashenko made it clear thatPrigozhin was facing death for his actions, and the mercenary warlord took the hint.Amilitary purge reportedly followed, but Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the Department of Defense did not see anything that should raise an alarm.Unfortunately for Prigozhin, the story did not end there but instead took one final, fatal turn two months later when his private jet exploded, ending the story of one of the most high-profile figures in the conflict outside of each country’s respective leader.MISSOURI SENATOR SAYS ‘LEFT HAS TAKEN OVER’ DEM PARTY AS CONGRESS FACES ‘REAL DISCONNECT’ ON ISRAEL, UKRAINEPrigozhin's exile seemed loose at best as the leaderreturned to Russia at least twice, seemingly within the first month he left the country.

The Kremlin waited a few days before confirming Prigozhin's death.PUTIN USES RUSSIAN CHURCH TO SPREAD HIS SAINTLY STATUS IN NATION WITH NO SEPARATION OF RELIGION AND STATEAt the time of the explosion, Putin was in Moscow presenting a state award to the crew of an Alyosha T-80 tank, which allegedly destroyed a Ukrainian armored convoy, Russian news agency TASS reported. Some compared Putin to the ""Godfather"" character Michael Corleone, who attended his son’s baptism while hitmen killed his rivals.Wagner’s future remains in flux: Putin has variously attempted to integrate the troops into the broader Russian military while alsoappointing Andrei Troshevas the new leader of Wagner.As bad as the Wagner drama may have appeared for Putin, it was far from the most troubling thorn in his side throughout the year: He spent more time figuring out how to keep the war effort going without resorting to a national draft, which would prove supremely unpopular among the Russian populace.HUNGARY VETOES $54B EUROPEAN AID PACKAGE FOR UKRAINE, DEALING ZELENSKYY ANOTHER BLOWRussia’s military also has continued to struggle with maintaining munitions after burning through its supplies in the first year.

The arrests occurred at the airport based on a tip-off, authorities say. (COURTESY: REUTERS / ANI)India’s prime minister begins a two-day visit to Russia on Monday, his first since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, a war that has complicated the relationship between the longtime partners and pushed Russia closer to India’s rival China.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit will include a meeting withPresident Vladimir Putin, whom he last saw in Russia in 2019, in the far eastern port of Vladivostok. The two leaders also met in person in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc.Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi’s importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports.STAMPEDE THAT KILLED 121 IN INDIA WAS CAUSED BY SEVERE OVERCROWDING AND LACK OF EXITS, AUTHORITIES SAYUnder Modi’s leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement.The partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, since Russia started developing closer ties with India’s main rival, China, because of the hostilities in Ukraine.Modi notably stayed away last week from the most recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, in Kazakhstan.Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greet each other before their meeting in New Delhi, India on Dec. 6, 2021. Modi on Monday begins a two-day visit to Russia that is his first since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, a conflict that has complicated the relationship between the longtime allies by pushing Russia closer to India's rival China.(AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File)Chietigj Bajpaee, senior South Asia research fellow at the U.K.-based Chatham House, said India is becoming increasingly estranged from forums in which Russia and China play a prominent role.""This is evident in India’s relatively low key presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last year, and now the decision by Modi not to attend this year’s summit,"" Bajpaee said.A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered their already touchy relationship as the rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have since persisted despite talks.Those tensions have seeped into how New Delhi looks at Moscow.""Russia’s relations with China have been amatter of some concern for Indiain the context of Chinese increased assertiveness in the region,"" D. Bala Venkatesh Verma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, told The Associated Press.But Modi also will seek to continue close relations with Russia, an important trading partner and major defense supplier for India.Since Western sanctions blocked Russian oil exports after the start of the Ukraine war, India has become a key buyer of Russian oil. It now gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts.India is also strongly dependent on Russia for military supplies, but with Moscow's supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy.""Defense cooperation will clearly be a priority area,"" Bajpaee said, adding that 60% of India's military equipment and systems is ""still of Russian origin.""""We've seen some delay in the deliveries of spare parts ... following the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" he said. ""I believe both countries are due to conclude a military logistics agreement, which would pave the way for more defense exchanges.""India has adopted a neutral stance, neither condemning nor condoning Russia’s war on Ukraine, and has called for negotiations to end the fighting. That in turn has bolstered Putin's efforts to counter what he calls the West’s domination of global affairs.Facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for actions over the war in Ukraine, Putin’s foreign travel has been relatively sparse in recent years, so Modi’s trip could help the Russian leader boost his image.""We kind of see Putin going on a nostalgia trip — you know, he was in Vietnam, he was in North Korea,"" said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. ""In my view, he’s trying to demonstrate that he’s not a vassal to China, that he has options, thatRussia is still a great power.""Alexander Gabuev, head of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Putin's interactions on the world stage show he ""is far from isolated"" and that Russia is not a country to be discounted.Trade development also will figure strongly in the talks, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between India’s major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russia’s Far East.India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to $65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters Friday.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPImports from Russia touched $60 billion and exports from India $4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, Kwatra said.

In May 2023, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry reported approximately 207,000 Russian troop deaths.The Russian government has kept its personnel losses a tight secret during its invasion of the much smaller neighboring country, in a likely effort to justify the lengthy and expensive fight and to keep its soldiers’ morale high.BIDEN LETS AMERICAN MILITARY INFO SLIP DURING LIVE INTERVIEW, SPARKING BACKLASHNearly 50,000 Russian soldiers have died in the war in Ukraine, according to a new statistical analysis.(Ukraine Foreign Ministry/ Twitter)The new study used a statistical concept popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic called excess mortality combined with data from the Russian government to provide a more accurate picture of Russia’s losses.Mediazona and the BBC’s Russian Service, working with a network of volunteers, used social media postings and photographs of cemeteries across Russia to identify and confirm 27,423 dead Russian soldiers between 2022 and 2023.""These are only soldiers who we know by name, and their deaths in each case are verified by multiple sources,"" Dmitry Treshchanin, a Mediazona editor who helped the investigation, told The Associated Press.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/record-number-nato-members-reaching-defense-spending-goal-ukraine-war-persists,Record number of NATO members reach defense spending goal as Ukraine war persists,NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said 23 of NATO's 32 member states are hitting the alliance's goal of spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.,June 18,2024-10-15,Ukraine War,Fox News,Ukriane,"Fox News’ Alex Hogan reports on the debate among NATO members on whether to allow Ukraine to use Western munitions and supplies for strikes on Russian soil.A record 23 of NATO's 32 member nations are hitting the Western military alliance’s defense spending target this year, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday, as Russia's war in Ukraine has raised the threat of expanding conflict in Europe.The estimated figure is a nearly fourfold increase from 2021, when only six nations were meeting the goal. That was before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scaleinvasion of Ukrainein 2022.""Europeans are doing more for their collective security than just a few years ago,"" Stoltenberg said in a speech at the Wilson Center research group.NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS THRASH OUT NEW SECURITY AID AND TRAINING SUPPORT PLAN FOR UKRAINEAfter the speech, Stoltenberg met at the White House with President Joe Biden. The U.S. president said the alliance has become ""larger, stronger and more united than it’s ever been"" during Stoltenberg's tenure.Biden spoke affectionately of Stoltenberg, calling him ""pal"" and saying he wished that Stoltenberg, who has been NATO's secretary general since 2014, could serve another term when the current one expires in October.""Together, we’ve deterred further Russian aggression in Europe,"" Biden said. ""We’ve strengthened NATO’s eastern flank, making it clear that we’ll defend every single inch of NATO territory.""President Joe Biden meets with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office at the White House on June 17, 2024.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Stoltenberg noted that allies were buying more military equipment from the U.S. ""So NATO is good for U.S. security, but NATO is also good for U.S. jobs."" he said.NATO members agreedlast year to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. The surge in spending reflects the worries about the war in Ukraine.Poland, at more than 4%, and tiny Estonia both lead the United States this year in the percentage of their GDP they spend on defense. Both countries border Russia.Defense spending across European allies and Canada was up nearly 18% this year alone, the biggest increase in decades, according to NATO’s estimated figures released Monday.Some countries also are concerned about the possible reelection of former President Donald Trump, who has characterized many NATO allies as freeloading on U.S. military spending and said on the campaign trail that he would not defend NATO members that don’t meet defense spending targets.""Shifting U.S. administrations have had the absolutely valid point to say that U.S. allies are spending too little,"" Stoltenberg told reporters. ""The good news is that’s changing.""Stoltenberg's visit is laying the groundwork for what’s expected to be a pivotal summit of NATO leaders in Washington next month. The mutual-defense alliance has grown in strength and size since Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago, with both Sweden and Finland joining.Defense spending by many European countries fell after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union seemed to neutralize what was then the prime security threat to the West.But after Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO members unanimously agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense within a decade. The full-scale invasion that Putin launched in 2022 spurred European countries newly on the front line of a war in the heart of Europe to put more resources into meeting that target.Much of the focus of the summit is expected to address what NATO and NATO member governments can do for Ukraine as it faces unrelenting air and ground attacks from its more powerful neighbor. They so far have resisted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s appeals to take his country into the bloc as long as the war is still on.Stoltenberg pointed to efforts to bolster Ukraine in the meantime. That includes NATO streamlining the eventual membership process for Ukraine, and individual NATO nations providing updated arms and training to Ukraine’s military, including the U.S. giving it F-16s and bringing Ukrainian pilots to the U.S. for training on the advanced aircraft.""The idea is to move them so close to membership that when the time comes, when there is consensus, they can become a member straight away,"" Stoltenberg said.However Russia’s offensive concludes, only taking Ukraine into the alliance will dissuade Putin from trying again in the future to conquer Ukraine, the NATO chief said.""When the fighting ends, NATO membership"" for Ukraine ""assures that the war really ends,"" he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has long been anathema to Putin, and it was one of his stated motivations for seizing Crimea. He offered last week to order an immediate cease-fire if Ukraine renounced plans to join the alliance, an offer that was dismissed by Ukraine.Aweekend conference held in Switzerlandwas billed as a first step toward peace and ended with pledges to work toward a resolution but had few concrete deliverables.

The $71 million increase could feed 3.8 million people once a day for one month, according to the UN branch.Russia’s invasion also affectedthe World Food Programme’s ability to obtain food. About 50% of its wheat came from Ukraine, according to Segar.""There's enough food between corn maize and wheat and oil that's stored in silos or on container ships in Ukraine to feed 400 million people,"" he said.""Imagine if we can't get that food to those who are starving, to those who are hungry,"" Segar continued. ""It is going to have a devastating effect on the world.""Almost all of Ukraine’s grain exports were shipped out of the Black Sea prior to the war, according to the World Food Programme.

The inauguration is scheduled for January 20, 2025.Election Day is on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Since 2024 is a presidential election year, citizens of the United States will be voting for a president and vice president to take office beginning in 2025.In addition to presidential elections every four years, there are also congressional elections that happen every two years, plus numerous local elections that happen yearly.Congressional elections refer to those where individuals are elected to represent states in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.

""There are direct 'election hacking' efforts that attempt to either directly or indirectly target the vote, by hacking into polling locations, registration databases, etc. Then, there are broader influence efforts that are intended to shape the context of the election itself – the issues, the mindset of voters.""Gualala, CA, July 4, 2020 - Person mailing United States absentee ballot for voting in an election by mail.Despite the uproar that rippled down during and after the 2016 election, which highlighted an array or Moscow-led misinformation campaigns,Facebookhas again been thrust into the hot seat – albeit armed with a few more resources, personnel, and knowledge – to demur election tampering.VATICAN UNDER FIRE FOR MOVING TO RENEW DEAL WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTYLast month, the tech giant announced that it had taken down hundreds of pages, postings, and accounts written in Chinese, English, and Filipino linked to a Chinese operation – but stopped short of pinning any blame directly on Beijing. Facebook said that the accounts were initially created several years ago and centered on altering perceptions of Chinese activity in the South China Sea, before taking a more U.S political turn last year.Moreover, some lawmakers this election cycle have also calledinto questionthe role non-profit foundations and charities have in being misused as a conduit for peddling and prying. Namely, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.,  wrote to top government officials last week requesting an investigation into how the CCP officials use nonpartisan American groups to push out Beijing's message and control narratives for those operating in their country.While the broad consensus among professionals is that Beijing favors a Joe Biden victory given President Donald Trump's rhetoric and trade crackdown against Xi Jinping's government, Whyte underscored that foreign powers ultimately aim to interfere so as to secure national interests.""The Chinese effort has combined some digital interference with more conventional forms of influence – dark money, message-crafting, and propaganda – to steer discourse and policy away from hot button issues for the CCP,"" he continued. ""This has meant astroturfing – the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization – conversations about Hong Kong so as to avoid visible outbursts of support. It has involved attempting to recast discussion of COVID-19 as Chinese in origins to fit the Party narrative.""Oct. 4: President Donald J. Trump participates in a phone call with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.(WHITE HOUSE)U.S. intelligence officials have also warned that the country is capable of far more sophisticated mechanisms than social media – pointing to modalities such as content farms, commentator brigades, and fake media personas to sway public opinion.Just weeks ago, Microsoft also sounded the alarm with a report highlighting Chinese activity focused on information persuasion and on raw intelligence collection from the Biden campaign and American think tanks. U.S. authorities typically view this as an ""opposition research"" effort to deepen their anti-Trump objectives.""Americans think of election interference through the lens of influence, with China being anti-Trump and Russia being pro-Trump, but state-sponsored hackers like China are equally focused on intelligence gathering,"" Eric Noonan, CEO of CyberSheath, pointed out. ""This work includes the harvesting of log-in credentials and coordinated phishing campaigns targeting politicians and politically connected individuals within or adjacent to the U.S.""""Chinese hackers have been active online, but their operations to date appear to be more targeted at intelligence gathering, espionage and suppression of activists and critics, rather than more direct 'election interference' per se,"" Karim Hijazi, CEO of Prevailion, said. ""The Chinese have traditionally been focused on cyber espionage. When it comes to our election, the Chinese are more likely to seek out ways of stealing information in order to better understand the policies, practices, and strategy of the next administration.Microsoft specifically identified the China-based group Zirconium as being behind the operation, warning the country ""already poses a high cyber-espionage threat to the Homeland and Beijing's cyber-attack capabilities will grow.""""We've detected thousands of attacks from Zirconium between March 2020 and September 2020, resulting in nearly 150 compromises. Its targets have included individuals in two categories. First, the group is targeting people closely associated with U.S. presidential campaigns and candidates,"" Microsoft stated. ""The group has also targeted at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump administration. Second, the group is targeting prominent individuals in the international affairs community.""The Florida state flag hands behind Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden as he speaks at Southwest Focal Point Community Center in, Pembroke Pines, Fla., Tuesday Oct. 13, 2020. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)The company noted that such targets have been ""academics in international affairs from more than 15 universities, and accounts tied to 18 international affairs and policy organizations, including the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center.""""Zirconium is using what is referred to as web bugs, or web beacons, tied to a domain they purchased and populated with content. The actor then sends the associated URL in either email text or an attachment to a targeted account,"" Microsoft explained. ""Although the domain itself may not have malicious content, the web bug allows Zirconium to check if a user attempted to access the site. For nation-state actors, this is a simple way to perform reconnaissance on targeted accounts to determine if the account is valid or the user is active.""But according to some analysts, this is hardly the first time that Beijing has moved into the meddling melee.""Years before the advent of Facebook and Twitter, Beijing initiated a well-resourced and multi-pronged campaign to positively influence public and political opinion about China and to neutralize potential threats to the regime's carefully crafted international image,"" noted Craig Singleton, an Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD). ""Such efforts began with relatively benign person-to-person exchanges and the cultivation of discreet relationships with influential U.S. business executives and decision-makers, including up and coming politicians.""He said that in the intervening years, these efforts have expanded to include disinformation operations, coercion, threats of retaliation, clandestine operations, and the weaponization of the West's regulatory, legal, and lobbying loopholes.Dean Cheng, senior research fellow and China analyst at The Heritage Foundation, also brought to light a more subtle means of maneuvering one's mind.""It would appear that at least some of the influence being employed is fairly typical -- targeting purchases of goods for states that are potential battlegrounds, or avoiding purchases from those same states,"" he said. ""In the Chinese system, it is difficult to state whether something is explicitly government-sanctioned.""And just as the private sector has poured billions into boosting efforts to counter malign election interference from far away, U.S. government and intelligence agencies have also devoted excess resources to stay ahead of the threat.Students attend a ceremony to kick off the new semester in Wuhan High School in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020. (Chinatopix Via AP)In its first-ever ""Homeland Threat Assessment""reportunveiled publicly last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security cautioned of intrusion by China, as well as Russia and Iran. In terms of the former, the warning signals pivoted around Beijing's bid to disseminate falsehoods pertaining to the Chinese handling of the coronavirus, along with fraudulent virus text kits and protective gear.TRUMP CAMPAIGN CLAIMS DOUBLE STANDARD, POINTS TO BIDEN USE OF FAUCI COMMENTSFrom the perspective of U.S. Attorney-General William Barr, China has been the most assertive and aggressive in election intrusion.""I believe it's China,"" Barr said in a CNN interview last month. ""Because I've seen the intelligence, that's what I've concluded.""In August, the U.S. State Department took abold stepin designating the Confucius Institute U.S. Center, a Beijing cultural wing set up on various U.S. college campuses, as a Chinese ""foreign mission"" that plays a pivotal part in the country's ""multifaceted propaganda efforts.""David Kennedy, a former hacker for the U.S. National Security Agency and now CEO of TrustedSec, and co-founder and CTO of Binary Defense, stressed that the U.S. has attempted to shore up the security around election systems and that additional funding was approved in December 2019 for $425 million towards election security, but it was hardly enough to redesign the overall systems.""What is needed is more of a standardized approach to voting systems and one that is designed to withstand attacks from highly skilled and trained adversaries,"" he conjectured. ""China is one of the most alarming adversaries out there because they focus on extreme long-term strategies aimed at bolstering China's influence around the world. They are one of the most advanced cyber warfare capable nations, and they focus on anything they can do to promote China first.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNonetheless, analysts also emphasize that the impact of election obstruction is challenging to aptly gauge, and understanding its consequence on the vote may never be fully understood or measured.""The biggest risk we face from the Chinese is information warfare,"" Hijazi added.

We must be strong and uncompromising all together,"" Zelenskyy said.Speaking in Washington four months before an election beset by new uncertainty following President Joe Biden's shaky debate performance, he aimed his message at Republicans, whose NATO-adverse leader looks to be in an improving position to win back the presidency.NATO PLACES NEARLY $700M ORDER FOR STINGER ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES, OFFICIAL SAYSThe president of the United States, Zelenskyy added, must be ""uncompromising in defending democracy, uncompromising against (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his coterie.""Zelenskyy has proven to be an adept navigator of international relations in defense of his war-ravaged country, publicly cajoling and sometimes loudly complaining to get the military assistance it needsto defend itself against Russia.This latest trip to Washington came against the backdrop of a fresh commitment of aid — Biden earlier Tuesday announced that dozens of air defense systems will be sent to Ukraine by NATO allies — but also ahead of an election that could yield a change in power. Zelenskyy said he hoped the race would not yield a policy overhaul.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks at the Ronald Reagan Institute on the sideline of NATO Summit in Washington on July 9, 2024.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)The Ukrainian leader sought to minimize the potential fallout of a Donald Trump victory,who is a NATO skepticand has criticized the Biden administration's support for Kyiv during Russia's war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy spoke at the Reagan Institute, named after Republican icon Ronald Reagan, and his appeal for support was directed at an audience of GOP heavyweights that included Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Zelenskyy will meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.""I hope that if the people of America will elect President Trump, I hope that his policy with Ukraine will not change,"" Zelenskyy said in a question-and-answer session with Fox News host Bret Baier after his speech. ""I hope that the United States will never go out from NATO.""Otherwise, he said, ""the world will lose a lot of countries"" that ""count on America.""Zelenskyy, who will have a separate meeting with Biden on Thursday, said he doesn’t know Trump well but had good meetings with him when he was president. He noted, however, that they did not go through the Russia-Ukraine war together, and only during a shared experience like that can one understand ""if you can count on somebody or not.""As president, Trump was impeached in late 2019 by the House of Representatives after pressuring Zelenskyy to announce an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, while withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Biden at the time was mounting a campaign to run against Trump in the 2020 election. Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.Despite the fresh aid announced Tuesday and the warm embrace he received from the Republican-dominated audience at the Reagan Institute, Zelenskyy finds that his most coveted prize — membership in the military alliance — remains elusive. The European and North American countries making up NATO are in no hurry to admit Ukraine, especially while it is engaged in active hostilities with Russia that could drag them into a broader war.Zelenskyy, who was feted as a champion of democracy in Washington in the aftermath of Russia’s 2022 invasion but was forced to plead his case for aid to U.S. lawmakers just last year, found himself once again in the American capital as bridesmaid.At the NATO summit, he is trying to navigate a turbulent American political landscape asBiden tries to show his strengthon the world stage and ability to keep leading the alliance's most important member, despite post-debate uneasiness among some fellow Democrats about his capacity to serve another four years.Trump, meanwhile, has criticized allies for not hitting defense spending goals and raised concerns in Europe about continued U.S. support for NATO and Ukraine. His Republican supporters in Congress were responsible for a monthslong delay in U.S. military assistance, which allowed Russia to gain ground against Ukraine's depleted forces.At a rally Tuesday night in Florida, Trump again sought to take credit for the number of NATO membercountries now meeting defense spending targets, saying that when he first addressed NATO members as president, ""nobody was paying."" The striking increase, however, came only after the Ukraine war began and when Biden was president.The stakes for Zelenskyy, meanwhile, have never been higher. On Monday, Russia unleashed its heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, which leveled a wing of Ukraine’s biggest children’s hospital.Against that backdrop, Biden announced that the U.S. and other NATO members will send dozens of air defense systems to Ukraine in the coming months, including at least four of the powerful Patriot systems it has been desperately seeking to help fight off Russian advances in the war.In the coming days, Zelenskyy will hear a chorus of support from countries that have poured weapons into his country, despite the recent damaging U.S. and European lags in greenlighting more aid.Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, whose country is the second-richest in NATO, says ""Germany stands unwaveringly by the side of the Ukrainians, especially in these difficult times.""But an invitation to join the alliance is not in the cards even as Russia’s latest strikes have galvanized support for Ukraine. NATO will not admit a new member until the conflict is resolved.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPInstead, it will present Zelenskyy with what officials are calling a ""bridge to membership."" That is supposed to lay out specific tasks, including governmental, economic and rule-of-law reforms, that Ukraine must fulfill to join.Many in Ukraine seeNATO membershipas the only way to protect against future Russian aggression if the war ends. But the yearslong conflict, which has cost thousands of Ukrainian lives, has left many frustrated and skeptical that their country will ever join the Western alliance.While Zelenskyy has largely been a successful politician on the world stage, he struggles to maintain his popularity in Ukraine, which has decreased in part because of persistent questions about corruption, analysts say.Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

But we are going to win New York. And that's the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it. And we're going to do it,"" Trump vowed.""We have to do it. We do it, and the election nationwide is over,"" Trump added as he spoke to what his campaign said was a capacity crowd of roughly 16,000 people packed into an arena in Nassau County, a suburban New York City Republican stronghold.Trump made a similar pledge four years ago before losing his native state to President Biden by over 23 points. And polling strongly suggests that Trump has no serious chance of carrying New York in his 2024 election showdown withVice President Kamala Harris.TRUMP TOUTS ‘UNION SUPPORT' AFTER TEAMSTERS SHOCKING ANNOUNCEMENTFormer President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, headlines a rally at the Nassau Coliseum, in Uniondale, New York on Sept. 18, 2024(Fox News - Julia Bonavita )It's been 40 years since a Republican nominee has carriedNew York statein a presidential election.You have to go back to President Ronald Reagan, who won the state as part of his landslide re-election victory in 1984.Trump promised New Yorkers that if he wins back the White House, ""I'm going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime, and reduce your levels of stress.""WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWNAnd the former president pledged that during a second Trump term, ""I will officially make the Ground Zero site at the World Trade Center a national monument protected and maintained by the United States government.""Wednesday's rally was Trump's second large campaign event this year in the Empire State, after drawing a big crowd in the New York City borough of the Bronx in May.Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump speak during a campaign rally in the south Bronx, in New York City, on Thursday, May, 23.(AP/Yuki Iwamura)While there was some chatter of New York potentially being in play asPresident Biden'spoll numbers started cratering following his disastrous late-June debate performance against Trump, the conversation was fleeting and quickly dissipated when Harris replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket two months ago.So why — with less than 50 days to go untilElection Dayand time becoming a very precious commodity — did Trump hold a campaign rally just outside of New York City?""Quite clearly, New York is the biggest media hub in the country,"" Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh told Fox News on the eve of the rally.Murtaugh emphasized that ""when [Trump] delivers a message there, it’s piped directly into homes in every market in every battleground state.

More than half a million people have died, half the 17 million population has been displaced, the number of those rendered disabled, disappeared and dispossessed is countless and the economy has been crushed to almost nonexistence.","September 30, 2020",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"For almost 10 years,SyrianPresident Bashar al-Assad has presided over a country that has been brought bitterly to its knees. More than half a million people have died and more than half of its 17 million population has been displaced, while the number of those rendered disabled disappeared and dispossessed is nearly countless, and the economy has been crushed to almost nonexistence.Yet the 55-year-old leader continues on his family's five-decade, iron-fisted rule on the broken nation, but his political future and the regime's survival could very well hinge on the U.S. vote come Nov. 3. President Trump and former Vice President Biden are likely to approach Syria and Assad's future in dramatically different ways – withIranianrelations at the centerpiece.And that could ultimately determine Syria's outcome.""Many Syrians feel reliant on the Republicans' victory in the upcoming presidential elections because that will mean more siege on Iran, the primary and most dangerous supporter of the Assad regime, with the blockade on Iran being reflected in the effect on its expansion in Syria,"" surmised Fadel Abdulghany, CEO of the Syrian Network for Human Rights. ""Without a doubt, we would have noticed a far broader proliferation than the current one without the current U.S. leadership; this was also reflected in Iran's financial and military support for the Syrian regime.""SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS U.S. SANCTIONS' SUFFOCATE SYRIANS, JUST LIKE GEORGE FLOYD'On the flipside, Biden has signaled that he wouldrestorethe 2014 Iran deal, of which he played a pivotal role in its development as the vice president.President Donald Trump, left, and former Vice President Joe Biden during the first presidential debate Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020, at Case Western University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)In September, the Democratic nominee said he would seek toreengagewith Tehran, warning that the country was ever closer to a nuclear bomb under Trump. However, the Islamic Republic's net of neighborhood proxy wars was not explicitly discussed.""The Iran issue could have a major impact in a scenario where Biden makes a full-throttle effort to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and decides to accommodate Iran by easing pressure on Assad, but that is hardly a given,"" said David Adesnik, a senior fellow and the director of research at Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""On the other hand, Biden may push back harder against Russia in cases like the vehicle ramming incident last month, which injured seven U.S. soldiers.""But according to Ayman Abdel Nour -- a Syrian reformist, defected government adviser and the president of the nonprofit Syrian Christians for Peace -- the Syrian diaspora in the U.S. has mixed support for both Trump and Biden. A number of Muslim community leaders held foreign policy Zoom meetings with the Democratic presidential contender in late July and then in August, he said, and several got behind aSyrian Americans for Bidencampaign.""At first, many Syrians felt optimistic. But in the first paper on his American-Arab agenda, there was no mention of Syria, so then (the campaign) went back and added a Syria paragraph to the bottom. But for many, it wasn't enough. We need more clarification,"" Nour told Fox News. ""And some are worried that there are still a lot of people around Biden who support Iran and restoring ties to Iran.""In an Aug. 24 meeting held between the Syrian Americans for Biden group and Biden's senior foreign policy adviser and former deputy secretary of state, Antony Blinken -- as per a transcript obtained by Fox News -- the Syrian Americans highlight that the biggest cause of concern in their community was Iran. When questioned as to whether a Biden-Harris administration would recommit to the Iran deal without addressing Iranian proxies in Syria and elsewhere, Blinken emphasized that the money given back to Iran in the Obama-era deal was “its own money, frozen in banks and given back to settle the historic debt as well as various infrastructure projects.”“A small proportion was spent by the IRGC, and to be clear: any dollar was a dollar too many,” Blinken continued, as per the transcript. “The region has changed since 2016, but a Biden-Harris administration would attempt to pursue another nuclear deal with the framework that engagement with Iran opens channels to address broader regional issues, including Syria.”He insisted that the Biden-Harris duo would “use the robust sanctions tools at our disposal to target Iran’s human rights abuses, support for terrorism, and ballistic missile program.”“Leverage over Iran we believe will be best when the U.S. is at the table and leading with our allies. The Trump administration isattemptingto use the ‘snapback’ provision in the UN, which would snapback a historic arms embargo on Iran should any participant renege or be dissatisfied with Iran’s adherence to the deal,” he said. “The U.S. gave up that leverage when it ceased to be a participant in that deal.”Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, meets with Syrian President Bashar Assad, right, in Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. Putin's visit was the second to the war-torn country where his troops have been fighting alongside Syrian government forces since 2015. (Syrian Presidency via AP)The full reinstatement of sanctions was rejected by the UN, but the Trump team has vowed to keep pushing.In 2012, Obama cautioned that the use of chemical weapons would be a blatant ""red line,"" but a year later – when such an attack did happen, and no follow-up military response was taken – Assad's resolve to wage war was only invigorated. Nour noted that most Syrians don't hold Biden responsible for that, stressing that the controversial inaction was initiated by the commander-in-chief and not his number two.But he also highlighted that the Syrian previously pushing for a Biden win also expressed concern that his added ""Syria policy paragraph,"" which stated that ""the Trump administration has repeatedly fallen short on U.S. policy in Syria,"" vowed to ""help mobilize other countries to support Syria's reconstruction.""""This is very dangerous,"" Nour said. ""We can't be talking about construction without a political solution to end this crisis.""Years on, Assad remains in the grand and imposing Presidential Palace – but staring out at a country that has largely crumbled. Assad can no longer turn to military allies Russia and Iran to boost the rebuilding bank account. According to estimates by The World Bank, the reconstruction endeavor in still-smoldering Syria will require some $400 billion.International donors across the board have proven hesitant to put forth funding that would ultimately boost the existing regime, and Moscow and Tehran are in the throes of their own economic spirals, largely due to U.S.-imposed sanctions, collapsing oil and gas prices, and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Washington and Brussels have, in addition, upheld a united front mandating that allies do not issue Damascus rebuilding loans until it concedes to a fair and inclusive political transition.At least for now.Added to the equation, depending on November's outcome, is Assad's very literal fate.When questioned about passages of Bob Woodward's new book ""Rage,""Trumpaffirmed on Fox News that he had a ""shot"" to take out Assad in 2017 in the wake of a yet another chemical attack on his own people inside a rebel stronghold, but he didn't take it because then-Defense Secretary James Mattis opposed the proposal in favor of a more ""measured"" approach.Since then, the Syrian leader has gone on to maim and massacre many hundreds of thousands more and regain control of almost 90% of the blood-spattered state. Assad's forces are at the cusp of retaking the remaining Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold peppered by the complicated presence of both well-intentioned freedom fighters and U.S.-designatedterroristoutfits.This Saturday, July 27, 2019 file photo shows a Syrian man carrying an injured girl after an airstrike hit the northern town of Ariha, in Idlib province, Syria. Syrian opposition activists and a war monitor said Sunday, July 28, 2019, that five people had been killed in airstrikes on Ariha on Sunday as the government keeps up its deadly air campaign against the rebel-controlled region. (Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets via AP, File)In a bid focused on keeping ISIS at bay, American troops still do have a small footprint in the country under Trump, andBidenhas pledged to maintain a Special Operations presence. Yet the U.S. envoy for Syria, Ambassador James Jeffrey, earlier this year pledged to ""double efforts"" to bolster a draft constitution that would pave the path for United Nations-endorsed government elections.""This depends on the international powers, who can come together for a new Syria. If not, this situation will continue,"" noted Loqman Ehme, spokesperson of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. ""The regions not under Assad will never accept to return to live under the Assad regime and live like before because what there was before was not really life.""Indeed, the sentiment among many Syrians is that something has to give -- regardless of who holds the White House.Life on the inside has been reduced to a state of perpetual anxiety over when the next rocket will crack, or if an intel officer will knock at the door. And for those on the outside, thrust into exile, it comes down to clawing through papers and posts trying to find news about missing loved ones.Dana Perino reacts to President Trump presiding over the signing of two momentous peace dealsIt is that ongoing and heavily reported rash of human rights perpetrated by the Assad leadership that has them exasperated and confused as to how and why he has remained. Since the start of the crackdown against protesters in 2011, which was met with a hail of government bullets, the documentation pointing to crimes against humanity has been ceaseless.The 9th Annual Report onEnforced Disappearancein Syria, released by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) in late August, underscored that more than 100,000 have fallen into the void since the start of the civil war nine and a half years ago, with some 85% attributable to the Assad regime.SNHR data shows that more than 12,325 were documented as having died under torture in Syrian government prisons and that some 13,000 are still imprisoned or missing, their fates unknown.JACOB TICE: MY BROTHER AUSTIN TICE ASKED ME TO GO TO SYRIA WITH HIM. FOUR MONTHS LATER, HE WAS TAKENUnited Nations investigators continue to condemn the abysmal levels of abuse. A September report from the Commission of Inquiry on Syria – its 21st – yet again illuminated that ""Syria's government continues to perpetuate rape, torture, and murder,"" while also acknowledging possible war crimes committed Turkey-backed coalition of rebel groups in the Idlib area.A U.N. Security Council resolution backed by more than 60 countries to refer the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court was vetoed by Russia and China in May 2014.In his meeting with Syrians, Blinken pledged that a Biden-Harris administration will need to ""balance against China and Russia in the UN,"" and the U.S. ""cannot walk away from it.""Meanwhile, the Trump White House has continued to level hefty sanctions on Assad, on Wednesday issuing a dozen more on government and military officials and businesses tied to the Syrian President for grave abuses committed throughout the conflict.In this May 3, 2019, file photo, smoke rises after Syrian government and Russian airstrikes hit the town of al-Habeet, southern Idlib, Syria. In their latest assault on the last rebel-stronghold of Idlib, the Syrian government and its Russian backer had resorted to familiar tactics to break the will of people and pressure civilians to flee: Target residential areas, bomb hospitals and markets, destroy civilian infrastructure. It is a well-established pattern that worked for President Bashar Assad's forces seeking to recapture Aleppo and other strategic rebel territories during the eight-year war. (Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets via AP, File)Nonetheless, most of the people in Syria continue to suffer in one way or another -- faces everywhere are etched with exhaustion. If Assad won't go willfully if more bodies pile up, could a second Trump term prompt him to make good on the ""take him out"" plan?""We see Assad as regime – an institution, an army and an intelligence apparatus committing massive crimes against humanity,"" conjectured Nour. ""And when that person goes, the full regime will collapse.""CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPOthers have a different perspective.""We do not want Assad to be killed, that would be not fair for millions of Syrians who suffered from him,"" added Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat and the co-founder and director of external relations of People Demand Change.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, discusses an ODNI election security update that says Russia is the primary threat to U.S. elections on The Ingraham Angle.Officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have warned that Russia has launched a plan to interfere in the 2024 election to bolster the chances offormer President Trumpbeing re-elected.In a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, ODNI officials said that Russia is the ""preeminent threat"" to the election and that while China doesn’t plan to influence the outcome of the presidential race, the communist nation is being carefully monitored to see if it mingles in down-ballot races.""It's all the tactics we've seen before, primarily through social media, efforts using influential U.S. voices to amplify their narratives and other tactics,"" an official said.

But to be clear, this is something we're watching at this time, rather than, actively seeing it as we did in the 2022 cycle. Right now, our assessment is focused that China doesn't perceive a benefit in supporting either candidate, or either party.""The official said that China is pulling data from TikTok and other social media platforms used in the U.S. in order to spread their influence narratives, as well as to collect publicly available data on users and public opinion.Meanwhile, the ODNI official said that Iran is seeking to stoke social divisions among the U.S. population and ""undermine confidence in the US democratic institutions aroundthe elections.""Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Tuesday that Iran is attempting through social media to covertly stoke protests in the U.S. against the war in Gaza.Anti-Israel protesters wave Palestinian flags in Washington Square Park in New York City on Friday, May 3, 2024.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/win-lose-harris-must-attend-highly-anticipated-jan-6-presidential-election-certification,"Reporter's Notebook: Win or lose, Harris must attend the Jan. 6 presidential election certification","Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris must preside over the Electoral College certification joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, as the vice president of the United States.",August 15,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Former President Trump takes questions from reporters at Mar-a-lago in Palm Beach, Florida, as the 2024 race heats up.We don’t know whetherVice President Kamala Harrisor former President Trump will win the White House this fall.But there are two things we do know:The 2024 presidential election is likely to be tight. And regardless of the victor, Harris will co-preside over her victory or defeat when the House and Senate convene a joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, 2025.She’s required to do so.The House and Senate will convene a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, to certify whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump won the 2024 presidential election.(Getty Images)FOX NEWS POLL: CLOSE RACES IN BATTLEGROUND STATES SHOW VOTERS LOCKED INThe House and Senate are the quadrennial arbiters of the electoral vote on Jan. 6. That’s why the date was so controversial four years ago. It devolved into a riot and emerged as one of the ugliest days in American history. What was usually a sleepy, ceremonial affair on Jan. 6 to tabulate and sign off on the electoral vote emerges forevermore as a major national security event — along the lines of State of the Union. And like it or not, possible controversy over the certification process next Jan. 6 likely gains momentum by the fact that Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee and will be on the dais for her defeat or victory.This scenario is just another radiating political isotope, augmenting our already unsteady political climate. It doesn’t help matters that Jan. 6, 2025, will be the first time Congress has met to certify the Electoral College since the mayhem of almost four years ago. That’s augmented by the fact that Trump stands to either officially win or lose on that day, too.The vice president presides over joint sessions of Congress alongside the speaker of the House. Under the Constitution, the vice president also serves as president of the Senate — the only leader mentioned in the Constitution when it comes to the Senate. Joint sessions of Congress are special parliamentary events. Congress only convenes in such a conclave for the president’s State of the Union address and to certify the Electoral College results.Vice presidents sometimes duck joint meetingsof Congress (note the slight difference). They look the same, but aren’t. Both bodies of Congress assemble in the House chamber for a joint meeting. Those circumstances are reserved for lawmakers to receive a foreign dignitary. Notably, Harris did not preside over a joint meeting of Congress for IsraeliPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahulast month.However, the speaker of the House always presides as the lead figure of that body — and the constitutional officer of the legislative branch of government.LEGAL EXPERTS SAY BIDEN ADMIN'S LEGAL THEORY IN JAN 6 PROSECUTION 'ON THE ROPES' AFTER SUPREME COURT ARGUMENTProtesters loyal to President Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)We don’t know who will appear alongside Harris on the dais for the Electoral College certification next year. That hinges on which party wins the House. Under the Constitution, the new Congress starts Jan. 3 at noon and must first elect a speaker. It will likely either be House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., if Republicans retain control, or if Democrats flip the House, expect them to tap House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.The certification of the electoral vote falls on Jan. 6 by design. That gives the new Congress a few days to prepare after it begins on Jan. 3. Moreover, Congress is tasked with certifying the election on Jan. 6 so that there’s ample time to prepare for the inauguration of the president on Jan. 20.It’s not unheard of for a vice president with skin in the game to preside over theElectoral Collegecertification joint session of Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon presided over his own re-election alongside President Dwight Eisenhower in the January 1957 joint session. Nixon was also vice president for the January 1961 session, watching himself lose to President John F. Kennedy. Vice President Hubert Humphrey was the Democratic nominee in 1968, so he co-presided over the joint session in January 1969 when Nixon finally ascended to the presidency.SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT PARTICIPANT WHO CHALLENGED OBSTRUCTION CONVICTIONSpeaking of Minnesota, Vice President Walter Mondale chaired the loss of President Jimmy Carter and himself to President Ronald Reagan in the 1981 joint session. Future President George H.W. Bush was on hand for the re-election of Reagan and himself in January 1985. As vice president, Bush then officiated over his own victory as president in January 1989. However, things were not as pleasant for former Vice President Dan Quayle four years later. Quayle co-moderated the loss by Bush and himself to President Bill Clinton in the January 1993 joint session.Vice President Al Gore was on the dais for the re-election of Clinton and himself in January 1997. But Gore found himself in a particularly awkward spot on the dais four years later. Gore presided over his own defeat in 2001 to President George W. Bush, after the election of 2000, one of the most controversial in U.S. history. During the joint session, a parade of members of the Congressional Black Caucus tried to contest the slate of electoral votes from Florida — which Gore famously lost. However, none of the House members had a Senate co-sponsor to challenge the Florida vote.Joe Biden presided over the Electoral College certification for President Barack Obama’s re-election in January 2013.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was one of those pushing for debate on Florida’s electoral voters. Gore asked Waters if she had a Senate petitioner.Waters replied that she didn’t and that she ""did not care.""Gore famously cut off Waters with a magnanimous line which drew applause.""The rules do care,"" observed Gore.Vice President Dick Cheney was there for the re-election of Bush 43 and himself in January 2005. However, there was a bona fide challenge to the Ohio slate of electors by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio.Bidenpresided for President Barack Obama’s re-election in January 2013. That also returned Biden to the vice presidency. And Biden helped oversee things in January 2017 when Trump prevailed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAnd of course, we all now know the efforts employed by Trump loyalists to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.Things will be a little different in January 2025. In late 2022, Congress adopted major changes to the archaic, 19th-century Electoral Count Act, which governed the electoral certification process. Among the biggest changes: a clarification that the role of the vice president is only ceremonial. Lawmakers wanted to make it clear that the vice president lacked power to accept or reject certain slates of electors. Moreover, the new law made it harder for lawmakers to challenge a state’s electoral slate. Before, it just required a sole House member and sole senator to join a petition. The current statute raises the bar to one-fifth of each chamber to contest a state’s electoral ballots.So — win or lose — Harris doesn’t have much of a role other than to show up.But just her presence on the ballot as the Democratic standard-bearer, presiding over her own election or loss, intensifies the nature of that proceeding.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/group-numbers-decide-us-presidency-turn-out,This group has the numbers to decide the US presidency – if they turn out,Recent research projects a national population of 25 to 30 million adults who qualify as theologically-defined evangelicals – and estimates that one third of them do not vote.,October 6,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Panelists Ryan Walters and Pastor Paula White-Cain discuss how religious voters are impacting the 2024 election on ‘Fox News @ Night.’Who areAmerican evangelicals, and what do they want? This is one of the questions perplexing politicians, pollsters and strategists in the run-up to Election Day.Recent research from Dr. George Barna conservatively projects a national population of 25 to 30 million adults who qualify as theologically-defined evangelicals – and estimates thatone thirdof them do not vote.Election Forum estimates that nearly 7 millionevangelicalsin swing statesalonedid not vote in the 2020 election. Whether out of disillusionment, disconnection or distrust, millions of would-be Christian voters sat out an election that was decided by tens of thousands of votes.Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump(Getty Images)Both major political parties have tried to appeal to faith voters in a way that demonstrates a partial (at best) understanding of who these Americans are and what they believe. Tactics like concocting candidate faith testimonies, parading denominational ""roots,"" or drumming up doctrinal statements just don’t work to activate truth-loving voters.WHY EVANGELICALS ARE WEDDED TO TRUMP AS HE MAKES A MORE BIBLICAL APPEALRecent polling indicates there is no presidential candidate in 2024 with the ability to decisivelycommand the ""Christian"" vote. There are several possible reasons why evangelical Christians have not been energized to turn out as a unified voting bloc.One such reason is backlash to emotional manipulation in politics. Politicians and their proxies in religious circles have distorted public policy issues to manipulate and confuse well-meaning Christian voters.Policies like unrestricted abortion and open borders have been painted with a veneer of Christian-like empathy and understanding. Well-funded special interest groups have employed sophisticated measures to influence evangelical voting behavior from within the church.Christians have lost trust in politicians and surrogates who attempt to hijack their sincerity to provoke sympathy for lawlessness or pressure them into tolerating beliefs that harm those who hold them. But attempts to shame and suppress conservative evangelicals using words like ""political idolatry"" and ""divisiveness"" are no longer working. Christians who are waking up to the fact that niceties do not convert fundamentally bad ideas into good or biblical policies should express this at the ballot box.‘EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS’ HOST HAS SAID ‘WHITENESS IS WICKED,’ POLICE NEED TO BE ‘DESTROYED AND REBUILT’Second, most Christian voters have not had the opportunity to hear theirown pastors speak freelyabout the issues at stake. Pastors have long been hindered from doing so by the Johnson Amendment, the provision in the Internal Revenue Code that restricts 501 (c)(3) nonprofits, including churches, from making statements of support or opposition to political candidates or even comparing the positions of candidates to Scripture.Absent such restrictions, this would be a critical time for faithful Christian clergy to speak with one voice to energize and activate their congregations to vote in alignment with their genuine interests and concerns. National Religious Broadcasters recently filed a challenge to the Johnson Amendment to preserve robust First Amendment freedoms in future elections, ensuring that pastors can speak freely on all matters that their faith informs – including issues on the ballot.Don Deazley carries a cross as he prays with Sue Hensal and others as they wait in line for a rally by former President Trump on Oct. 5, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)But at this stage in the 2024 presidential election, there are very few truly undecided voters. Most evangelical Christians have already concluded which candidates best align with their Christian beliefs and their hopes for America’s future. While there may only be a small number of voters still contemplating the choice between former President Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris, or other federal, state or local candidates further down the ballot, many more are wavering between action or inaction. The decision at hand is whether to put their vote into the ballot box.FAITH VOTERS WILL ‘DECIDE THIS ELECTION,' ACCORDING TO PROMINENT GOP MEMBERSThe justification for participating in the 2024 presidential election does not rest on the religious devotion or clean moral track record of any candidate for office. I believe that every Christian has a moral and ethical duty to participate in this election for three main reasons.First, the magnitude of what this president will inherit cannot be overstated. The job of the 47th U.S. president willnotbe to charm and delight the U.S. public. On the contrary, the individual who takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2025, will be responsible for the following:An untenable situation at the U.S. southern border, which constitutes a massive humanitarian and public safety crisis billable to the American taxpayer; a dangerously destabilized Middle East, with Iranianmissiles sailing into Israelin recent days; the urgency of negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia; the troubled state of the U.S. economy and much more.To deliver this job to someone without the strength, fortitude and moral clarity to choose the correct course of action – and do what they say they will do – would be a great disservice to America and to the world.DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: ‘ANTI-CHRISTIAN’ PARTYSecond, the violence and bloodshed surrounding this presidential election is a direct reflection of America’s spiritual condition. Trump is only the second U.S. president (after President Gerald Ford) to survive multiple assassination attempts, with the attack on Trump’s rally in July resulting in the death and injury of innocent bystanders.Far from being defined by ""joy,"" the run-up to this election has beenmurderous and bloodthirsty. The 2024 presidential election has been a national encounter with spiritual darkness. The forces of evil have shown up. Will Christians respond? We must not only pray steadfastly for America’s spiritual welfare, but we must show up to vote with determination and resolve come Nov. 5.Third, Harris and Trump offer two radically different visions for America, implicating serious issues of Christian concern beyond the obvious national priorities.Trump does not assert that his policies are informed by Christianity or the Bible, but by principles of common sense and consensus-building. Indeed, he has acted with an eye toward pragmatism and political viability on some issues where Christians have asked for stronger commitments. Trump has nonetheless demonstrated openness to persuasion on moral issues and has pledged to safeguard the free exercise of religion and conscience protections that are cherished by religious believers.NEW 'GOD'S NOT DEAD' FILM INSPIRES CHRISTIANS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AT BALLOT BOXHarris has cited faith as a direct justification for her positions and ideas and has asked that faith leaders use their credibility to support these aims. In 2022, Harris told the National Baptist Convention, ""As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.""One cannot help but conclude thatHarris would not favorstrong conscience protections for these ""extremists,"" nor spare the taxpayer dollars of her coreligionists from being spent on unrestricted abortion.Single-issue voters should be aware that there aremultipleissues at stake in this election which Scripture addresses clearly. Bound up in these diverging visions for America are numerous proposals that Christian voters must diligently examine from a biblical viewpoint, such as protecting the innocence of children, promoting a culture of life and family formation, empowering parents, ending the unjust weaponization of government and defending against persecution of Christians.REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM CALLS OUT 'EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS' FOR 'TRYING TO MISLEAD PEOPLE' USING HIS FATHER IN ADIf you are not certain of the importance of your voice on Nov. 5, I urge you to further research the policies connected to the names on the ballot. Learn what your candidates are promising to do, and consider whether they can keep their promises. Voters who feel torn by the presidency need to remember that there are issues and candidates up and down the ballot whose decisions will directly impact the state and community where you live.Christian, your vote will influence theoutcome of the 2024 electionwhether you cast it or not.

As Christians, we willingly render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, and unto God what is God’s.In this era of our nation’s history, our elections involve questions of moral good and evil, the lives and health of the next generation, and the future of global peace and security.

Tim Walz, visiting with faculty and students at a high school before stopping by a barbecue joint.On Thursday, Harris and Walz will sit for their first major interview before the vice president holds what's expected to be a large rally in Savannah.By choosing the Peach State for her first campaign trail swing following last week's Democratic National Convention, Harris is making a statement - thatGeorgia is once again in playin November's election.NEW FOX NEWS POLL NUMBERS IN FOUR KEY BATTLEGROUND STATESDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris talks as she visits SandFly Bar-B-Q in Savannah, Ga., Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2024.

The most recent Fox News survey in Georgia beforeBiden dropped outof the race indicated Trump topping the president by six points, 51%-45%.Georgia's popular two-term conservative governor agrees that his state's very competitive.""Certainly this is a battleground state,""Gov.

She previously hosted a large rally in downtown Atlanta.But this time around, Harris is barnstorming through the southern part of the state, far from Atlanta and its growing suburbs, which make up nearly 60% of Georgia's population. The traditional route for Democrats to win statewide in Georgia is to concentrate on metropolitan Atlanta.But Quentin Fulks, who was principal deputy campaign manager under Biden and has remained in that role with Harris, is following the playbook from two years ago when he steered Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock's narrow re-election victory over GOP challenger Hershel Walker. The strategy is to not only win big in Atlanta and its suburbs, but also to stay competitive in the rest of the state.""We have to make sure that we are competing everywhere across the state,"" Fulks said Tuesday in an interview on MSNBC. ""We're going to continue to run in rural counties. …. We have to be statewide in that state and even compete in counties that Democrats don't traditionally go. That is how you win statewide in Georgia.""WASH, RINSE, REPEAT: WHY JD VANCE IS CONCENTRATING ON THESE 3 STATESThe Harris campaign noted that ""campaigning in Southeast Georgia is critical as it represents a diverse coalition of voters, including rural, suburban and urban Georgians — with a large proportion of Black voters and working-class families.""Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks to marching band members at Liberty County High School in Hinesville, Ga., Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2024.

All of you,"" Harris told the students. ""We’re so proud of you. Your generation, all that you guys stand for … is what is going to propel our country into the next era of what we can do and what we can be.""The vice president told the students that she was in band when she was in high school, according to a pool report.The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee took aim at Harris as her bus tour got underway.""The Trump campaign is fighting and winning in Georgia by building a broad coalition of support from those fed up with her four years of failure in the White House,"" senior adviser Brian Hughes told Fox News.And RNC spokesperson Morgan Ackley argued that ""while our highly engaged and energetic operation in Georgia is focused on turning out votes across the entire state, Democrats in Georgia are finally learning an important lesson…there is more to Georgia than just Atlanta.""Ackley emphasized that ""Republicans from Catoosa to Camden County and everywhere in between are fired up and ready to re-elect President Donald J. Trump because his message of putting America first again resonates with Americans of all backgrounds.""But the Harris campaign appears to enjoy a large organizational advantage over Trump's team in Georgia. And Republican strategists agreed that to recapture Georgia, Trump will need assistance from Kemp's well-oiled and funded political machine to turn out GOP voters.Former President Trump, right, is joined by his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, during at a campaign rally at Georgia State University in Atlanta Aug. 3, 2024.(AP Photo/John Bazemore)For two years after his 2020 election defeat to Biden, which included a razor-thin loss in Georgia, Trump attacked Kemp for failing to overturn the election results in his state.Trump toned down the criticism in 2022 after Kemp crushed Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue in the state's GOP gubernatorial primary.Then, earlier this month, Trump went on a 10-minute tirade against Kemp at a rally in Atlanta just blocks from the Georgia State Capitol. Trump blamed the governor not only for failing to overturn the 2020 vote count but also for not stopping a county prosecutor from indicting the former president for his attempts to reverse the results.But last week, in a major change of tune, Trump aimed to patch up his differences with Kemp by praising the governor in a social media post.Kemp told Fox News Digital that ""I’ve been consistent for really the last couple of years that I was going to support the ticket, whoever our nominee was, in Georgia. That’s exactly what I’m doing, what I have been doing.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPKemp on Thursday will join his wife, Georgia first lady Marty Kemp, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served in the Trump administration, to headline a fundraiser in Atlanta for the former president.""It’s my belief that we cannot afford four more years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, which I think would probably be worse than even Biden and Harris were,"" the governor argued.""I believe Republicans need to stay focused on litigating Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s record. … We need to be telling people why they should vote for us, what we’re going to do to make things better than they are right now.""Another sign of how important Georgia is in deciding the White House race - the massive amount of money being spent by both the Harris and Trump campaigns to run ads in the state.The Trump campaign is dishing out nearly $33 million to reserve ad time on Georgia airwaves for the final stretch, with the Harris campaign spending over $42 million, according to figures from the national ad tracking firm AdImpact.Spotlighting the stakes, veteran Georgia-based Republican consultant Stephen Lawson noted that ""from the Trump-Kemp détente to Harris campaigning in rural Georgia to the massive spending, just continues to underscore that the road to the White House runs through Georgia.""""That was true in 2020. It's why Joe Biden is in office right now,"" Lawson highlighted.And looking ahead to this autumn's presidential election, he added that ""I think it will be very, very, difficult for either Harris or Trump to win the White House without winning Georgia.""Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-tops-trump-two-points,Fox News Poll: Harris tops Trump by two points,"Vice President Kamala Harris edges former President Trump in a head-to-head matchup, as more voters see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class.",September 18,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Vice President Kamala Harris edgesformer President Trumpin a head-to-head matchup, as more voters see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class, and Hispanics and independents swing in her direction.The new Fox News national survey finds a 3 percentage-point shift among registered voters in the 2024 presidential contest since mid-August. Trump had a 1-point advantage last month, while Harris is ahead by 2 points today: 50%-48%. For reference, in July, Trump was ahead by 1 point over President Biden. Each of those differences falls within the margin of error.This marks the first timeHarris has hit 50% support, and the trial ballot result is identical among both registered and likely voters. That’s unsurprising given most Americans who are willing to spend time answering a political survey are also probably going to vote.Of course, presidential elections are decided by electoral votes from the states, not national vote totals. Hillary Clinton had a 2-point popular vote margin over Trump in 2016 but lost the Electoral College 304-227, while Biden’s 4-point popular vote win in 2020 translated to a 306-232 Electoral College victory.Since the August survey, many events have occurred that could affect voter opinion: the Democratic National Convention was held; Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump; former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Congresswoman Liz Cheney endorsed Harris; and the candidates faced off in a debate. A second assassination attempt on Trump happened about three-quarters of the way into the new survey.The biggest change since last month is that independents and Hispanics have swung Harris’ way. Hispanics favored Trump by 6 points in August, but they go for Harris by 12 points today. Independents went for Trump by 8 points last month, but now prefer Harris by 12. It is important to remember that estimates among small subgroups are more volatile and tend to swing more than others, and that applies here.FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATESTrump gets his best numbers from voters who regularly attend worship services, non-college White men, rural voters and men.Harris’ strongest backing comes from Black voters, urban voters, those under age 30, voters 65 and over, college graduates and women. She’s narrowly ahead in union households, a group that Biden won by low double-digits. Her numbers also still trail his2020 pre-election numbersa bit among Blacks and young voters. Democrats are optimistic these groups will ultimately back Harris, but that is certainly an unknown.Harris holds onto almost all of 2020 Biden voters (93%) and Trump keeps nearly all his 2020 backers as well (94%). Among 2020 non-voters, Harris is up by 3 points, 51%-48%.When looking at results only among counties where the 2020 presidential vote was close (Biden and Trump within 10 points), Trump is ahead 50%-48% — and he holds the same edge across the combined battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin).""Our best estimates are that if Trump is within 2 points of Harris nationally then he will likely win in the Electoral College,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""These data showing a Trump edge in the key counties and battleground states suggest that’s probably right.""Overall, 72% of Trump supporters say they like his policies and record and another 8% like his character, but 19% say they simply dislike Harris. Views are more mixed among those backing Harris, as 42% like her policies and record, 24% like her character, while 33% say they are backing her because they dislike Trump.Roughly 7 in 10 Harris and Trump supporters say they are ""extremely"" motivated to vote this year.And while most of each candidate’s supporters feel certain of their vote choice, about 1 voter in 10 is moveable.Most Republicans (75%) consider themselves a supporter of MAGA, but among non-MAGA Republicans one in five backs Harris over Trump (21%).More voters think Harris (53%) has the temperament to serve effectively as president than Trump (47%). For Trump, that is a 10-point improvement since 2017 when 37% said he had the right temperament (2017 is the most recent time the question was asked about him, and this is the first time it was asked of Harris).Harris is seen as the candidate who will help the middle class by a 9-point margin and protect personal rights and freedoms by 6 points. She also bests Trump by 5 points on ""fighting for people like you"" and ""uniting the country."" There’s little difference on who will make the country safe (Trump +3 points), protect free speech (Harris +1), and bring needed change (Harris +3).Over half of Hispanic voters trust Harris over Trump on each of those measures, hitting nearly 6 in 10 on helping the middle class and fighting for people like you. She also does better among independents on each, except making the country safe, where he has a 3-point edge.""Harris’ advantage over Trump on a variety of personal traits is clearly helping her,"" says Shaw. ""It’s a big deal that she’s been able to fight to a draw on protecting free speech despite aggressive Republican efforts to highlight the Biden administration’s censorship of right-leaning views on social media.""More than 8 in 10 voters want the next president to make significant changes in the country, including one-third who are looking for ""drastic"" change. Trump is preferred by a wide 31-point margin among those wanting drastic change, but that narrows to just 4 points among the larger group looking for either major or drastic change.When asked who they trust to handle top issues, voters favor Trump on immigration (+10), the Israel-Hamas war (+7) and theeconomy(+5). Since being first asked this question in March, his advantage on the economy is down 10 points compared to his 15-point lead over Biden and down 8 points on immigration (was +18).Harris is favored to handle election integrity (+7), health care (+11), abortion (+16), transgender issues (+16) and climate change (+17). It’s noteworthy neither candidate has a real advantage on guns or taxes, both traditionally GOP issues.As has been the case all year, the economy is the most important issue for voters this election. Thirty-nine percent say it is the priority, while fewer than half that number say immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues receive 7% or less.Twice as many Republicans (50%) as Democrats (25%) say the economy is the top issue and 10 times as many Republicans say immigration (30% vs. 3% Democrats). Democrats are 5 times as likely to say abortion is the most important issue (27% vs. 5% GOP).Some 70% of voters rate economic conditions negatively. That’s an improvement from a record 84% who felt that way in July 2022 (a record Biden) and puts things on par with ratings early in Biden’s presidency.Trump’s advantage on the economy comes from voters remembering his presidency as a sunnier time. By a 17-point margin, more say the Trump administration’s policies helped rather than hurt them. When thinking about Biden, voters are more likely to say his administration’s policies are hurting them by a 24-point margin.Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have better personal favorability ratings than Trump and his vice-presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz is the only one voters view more favorably than unfavorably (+3 points). While Harris’ ratings are net negative by 2 points, her 49% favorable is her highest in over three years. Trump is underwater by 8 points and Vance by 12. About 1 in 6 are unfamiliar with Walz and Vance. Biden’s rating is negative by 17 points, 41% favorable vs. 58% unfavorable.While Democrats and Republicans have largely positive views of their candidates, each individual tested is underwater when it comes to the small subgroup of independents.A larger share sees Harris (55%) as being willing to say anything to get elected than feel the same about Trump (48%). Only 43% think Harris says what she believes vs. 51% for Trump.Abortion is the single most important issue motivating Harris supporters to vote (38%), closely followed by ""stopping the other side from winning"" (36%). For Trump supporters, immigration (49%) and high prices (49%) tie as the single most important factor motivating them.FOX NEWS POLL: 87% CONSIDER SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER A PROBLEMOverall, voters say the thing most likely to get them to turn out and vote is high prices (39%), followed by immigration (32%), stopping the other side from winning (29%), abortion (27%), violent crime (26%), the race of the candidates (9%) and the gender of the candidates (7%).CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhoever wins will be on TV a lot for the next four years. When asked what they do when Harris comes on TV, voters say, by a 50%-48% margin, they turn up the volume rather than change the channel. For Trump, 48% turn it up and 49% change the channel — almost identical to views in 2016 (46% turn up, 47% change). At that time, 41% said they would turn up the volume forHillary Clintonand 52% said change the channel.CLICK HERE FORTOPLINEANDCROSSTABSConducted Sept. 13-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,102 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-has-keys-white-house-historian-ace-record-calling-elections-weighs-trump-verdict,Who has the 'Keys to the White House'? Historian with ace record calling elections weighs in on Trump verdict,"American University professor Dr. Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted nine of the last 10 presidential elections, weighs in on former President Trump's guilty verdict.",June 10,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Dr. Allan Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University, discusses his ""Keys to the White House"" and whether President Biden is in position to win re-election this November.FormerPresident Trump'scriminal conviction in his historic New York trial may have thrown the 2024 presidential election into unprecedented upheaval – or it may not have, according to Dr. Allan Lichtman.The American University historian, who has correctly predicted the outcome of nine of the last 10 U.S. presidential elections, told Fox News Digital that instant analysis of Trump's conviction is meaningless as the country looks forward to Election Day. ""We're not going to know much until the sentencing hearing on July 11, right before the Republican convention,"" Lichtman said in an interview.Allowing himself to speculate, the proven prognosticator said Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records does not appear to have fundamentally cracked his base, which Trump will need united to defeat President Biden in November. But no one knows, neither Lichtman nor the pundits he perennially outperforms, how Americans outside Trump's base will react to a convicted criminal on the presidential ballot.""We don't know how this might affect moderate and swing independent voters. So really, we have got to look over time and not rely on instant, unreliable punditry,"" said Lichtman.TRUMP GETS WARM RECEPTION AND PILES OF CAMPAIGN CASH DURING SUNNY BLUE STATE SWINGLichtman does not believe that former President Trump's guilty verdict has tarnished the overall support of his base.(Eric Thayer for The Washington Post via Getty Images)Lichtman is a historian, not a psychic. The formula he's used to correctly predict nearly everypresidential racesince 1984, his ""Keys to the White House,"" was developed in 1981 with mathematician Vladimir Keilis-Borok and is based on their analysis of presidential elections dating back to 1860. The secret to his success, Lichtman says, is to keep his own personal preferences out of his predictions.""We reconceptualize presidential elections not as Carter versus Reagan, Republican versus Democrat, liberal versus conservative, but in geophysical terms,"" he explained. ""Stability: The White House party keeps power. Earthquake: The White House party is turned out.""The ""keys"" consist of 13 true or false questions, parameters that, if true, favor stability. When eight or more of the keys are false, the incumbent White House party is the predicted loser. This formula helped Lichtman correctly predict that Trump would prevail in 2016, when the polls, debate performances and political commentators all favored Democrat Hillary Clinton. Previously, he said President Barack Obama would win re-election when Republican Mitt Romney was favored. And he correctly called the 2020 election for Biden.""The keys are an alternative to the polls, which are not predictors. They're snapshots, they're abused, not used as predictors. And the pundits, you know, who are a lot of fun, but they're sports talk radio. They have no scientific basis for any of their predictions,"" Lichtman argued.TRUMP RILES UP FIERY SWING STATE CROWD IN FIRST RALLY SINCE NEW YORK CONVICTIONLichtman believes he has the secret to predicting who will win the vote in any U.S. presidential election, and he has the record since 1984 to prove it.(Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images)The 2024 election is still in flux, and so Lichtman has not made a final projection for this year. But a lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose to Trump, he claims.Lichtman's keys are as follows: party mandate, contest, incumbency, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma and challenger charisma.As things stand,Biden has definitivelylost two of Lichtman's keys. ""He's lost what I call the mandate key based on midterm elections, because the Democrats lost seats in 2022, they needed to win seats to win that key. And he loses the charisma key because he's no Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy,"" Lichtman said.If six keys turn against Biden, he is likely to lose. The four keys to watch are whether Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., or another third-party candidate wins at least 10% support in national polls; social unrest linked to widespread anti-Israel protests on college campuses, and success or failure for Biden's foreign policy endeavors amid the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.POLLING GURU FLOATS THE IDEA OF BIDEN DROPPING OUT: AT SOME POINT ‘CONTINUING TO RUN IS A BIGGER RISK’Lichtman says that Biden currently holds two of the ""keys"" – but notes that the rest appear to be in flux.(Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Several Democratic strategists and a number of pundits are losing confidence in Biden's campaign as polls show Trump ahead inseveral key swing states. Election data guru and FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver suggested Monday that the president's ""all-time low"" in approval ratings might be enough justification for him to drop out or for the party to nominate someone else at the Democratic convention in August.Lichtman warns that replacing Biden would be a massive unforced error for Democrats.""With Biden running, he wins my incumbency key: sitting president. He wins the party contest: uncontested. Essentially, that means he wins two keys off the top,"" Lichtman explained.Without Biden on the ticket, the Democrats would automatically lose two more keys, meaning just four more would have to fall to predict their defeat.JAMES CARVILLE REGRETS THAT BIDEN IS RUNNING, WORRIES YOUNGER GENERATION UNINTERESTED IN POLITICSWithout Biden on the Democratic ticket, the party would automatically lose two more keys.(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson and Evan Vucci)""This nonsense about Biden stepping down points to the dangers of off-the-top-of-the-head punditry and commentary that is not based on any scientific understanding of how elections work,"" Lichtman said.Doom and gloom punditry is part of what Lichtman calls the ""political industrial complex"" – an iron triangle of pollsters and political consultants who profit from campaigns, news reporters eager to cover negative soundbites and politicians who are afraid to challenge the other two points of the triangle. The horse race theory of elections creates drama and makes money for those involved, Lichtman claims, but it's not very helpful to inform Americans about the direction of the country.""The keys provide a way of breaking the iron triangle,"" said Lichtman. ""The candidates themselves have to run different kinds of campaigns,"" he added. ""Campaign by the keys, which is, you campaign on your vision. If you're an incumbent, what it is you have done and what you expect to do. If you're a challenger, what's your clear vision for America?""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNobody remembers conventional campaigns. The ones that make history, Lichtman argues, are the substantive campaigns that articulated a vision for the country – think Barry Goldwater in 1964, who lost in a landslide but defined conservative principles for generations to come. Or George McGovern, whose liberal principals have shaped the Democratic Party since he was defeated by Richard Nixon in 1972.""Ronald Reagan in 1980very forthrightly put forth his views on tax cuts, deregulation, building the military, challenging the Soviet Union. And he won, he won big,"" Lichtman said. ""And that philosophy again influenced politicians, in his case both liberal and conservative, through our time.""Fox News Digital's Aubrie Spady and Joe Schoffstall contributed to this report.Chris Pandolfo is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

In swing state North Carolina, mail-in voting begins on Sept. 6. Early voting begins on Sept. 16 in Pennsylvania and Sept. 26 in Michigan, two other crucial electoral battlegrounds.With the clock ticking,former President Donald Trumpsays he has the momentum.BIDEN TEAMS UP WITH HARRIS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DROPPING OUT OF 2024 RACERepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, on Friday, Aug. 30, 2024.(AP Photo/Rebecca Droke)""We're leading in the polls now,"" the former president said in an interview Friday with Fox News' Bryan Llenas.Minutes later, at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Trump touted that ""our poll numbers are starting to skyrocket.""NEW FOX NEWS POLL NUMBERS IN 4 KEY BATTLEGROUND STATESDemocratic nomineeVice President Kamala Harris is urging her supporters to ""not pay too much attention to the polls because we are running as the underdog.""Harris, at a rally in Savannah, Georgia, late last week, pointed to her showdown with Trump and said, ""We have some hard work ahead of us.""Vice President Kamala Harris points to supporters as she arrives at a rally in Savannah, Georgia, on Aug. 29, 2024.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)Most of the latest national surveys show Harris with a slight single-digit edge over Trump, but the presidential election is not a national popular vote contest. It is a battle for the individual states and their electoral votes.Thelatest surveysin the seven battleground states that decided the 2020 election between Trump and President Biden – and will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 showdown – indicate a margin-of-error race. Among those polls are a batch from Fox News that made headlines last week.It is a big change from earlier this summer when Biden was still running.Biden's disastrous performanceagainst Trump in their late June debate turned up the volume of existing doubts from Americans that the 81-year-old president would have the physical and mental stamina to handle another four years in the White House. It also sparked a rising chorus of calls from top Democratic Party allies and elected officials for Biden to drop out of the race.National and battleground state polls conducted in July indicated Trump had opened up a small but significant lead over Biden.Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.(Getty Images)The president dropped his re-election bid on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, and Democrats immediately coalesced around Harris, who quickly enjoyed a boost in her poll numbers and in fundraising.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPStill, pollsters and political analysts stress that the Harris-Trump contest remains a coin-flip at this point.While the former president touts his standing in the polls, his team emphasizes they like the current poll position, as they point out that the former president has a history of outperforming public opinion surveys.""At this point in the race in 2016, Donald Trump was down to Hillary Clinton by an average of 5.9 points.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/shocking-scale-of-russias-sinister-social-media-campaign-against-us-revealed,Shocking scale of Russia’s sinister social media campaign against US revealed,"Russia's influence campaign during the 2016 presidential election was a sophisticated and multifaceted effort to target the African-American community and sow political division among the public across social media platforms, according to new reports produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee.","December 17, 2018",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Why 2018 could be seen as a canary in the coal mine for Facebook.Russia's influence campaign during the 2016 presidential election was a sophisticated and multifaceted effort to target the African-American community and sow political division among the public across social media platforms, according to new reports produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee.One report, which is 100-pages long, provides new context and details regarding the large scope of the multi-year Russian operation and the nefarious tactics it employed to exploit divisions along race and political ideology in the U.S. on a range of social media platforms, includingGoogle-owned YouTube,Facebook,Twitter, and on Facebook-ownedInstagram. The shadowy effort aimed to support the Trump campaign, denigrate Hillary Clinton, suppress the vote, sow discord and attack various public figures.According to the report released on Monday, the massive operation reached 126 million people on Facebook, posted 10.4 million tweets on Twitter, uploaded over 1,000 videos to YouTube, and reached over 20 million users on Instagram. The report states that roughly 6 percent of tweets, 18 percent of Instagram posts and 7 percent of Facebook posts mentioned Trump or Clinton by name. However, Trump was mentioned roughly twice as often as Clinton on most platforms. The report, titled ""The Tactics and Tropes of the Internet Research Agency,"" warns that the manipulation of U.S. political discourse continues in 2018.The report, which was commissioned by cybersecurity firm New Knowledge, Canfield Research and Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, reveals that theInternet Research Agency(IRA), a Russian company owned by a businessman who is reportedly a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, hit on a range of themes and social issues over and over again across multiple online platforms, including Muslim culture, black culture, gun rights, LGBT issues, patriotism, Tea Party issues, veterans' rights, pro-Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein content, Christian culture and Southern culture and American separatist movements.GOOGLE CEO ON CAPITOL HILL: SOME OF THE WEIRDEST EXCHANGESHowever, the report says the most prolific, intense efforts centered on targeting black Americans and appear to have focused on developing audiences in that community and recruiting black Americans as ""assets"".""The IRA created an expansive cross-platform media mirage targeting the Black community, which shared and cross-promoted authentic Black media to create an immersive influence ecosystem,"" the report states. ""The IRA exploited the trust of their Page audiences to develop human assets, at least some of whom were not aware of the role they played. This tactic was substantially more pronounced on Black-targeted accounts.""In a statement to Fox News, the Black Lives Matter Global Network responded to the reported targeting.""The Black Lives Matter Global Network understands that it is a target as we continue to fight for Black liberation across the globe, and we will not be deterred by those attempting to exploit us and the millions of Black folks in America who vote and demand change,"" the statement said.The report also reveals the shocking scale of the disinformation campaign on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. “Instagram was a significant front in the IRA’s influence operation, something that Facebook executives appear to have avoided mentioning in Congressional testimony,” it says. “There were 187 million engagements on Instagram. Facebook estimated that this was across 20 million affected users. There were 76.5 million engagements on Facebook; Facebook estimated that the Facebook operation reached 126 million people.”Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives to chair a meeting to discuss preparation to mark the anniversary of the allied victory in the World War II in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2018.(AP)FACEBOOK'S FALL: FROM THE FRIENDLIEST FACE OF TECH TO PERCEIVED ENEMY OF DEMOCRACYResearchers also note that in 2017, as the media covered their Facebook and Twitter operations, IRA shifted much of its activity to Instagram. “Instagram engagement outperformed Facebook, which may indicate its strength as a tool in image-centric memetic (meme) warfare. Alternately, it is possible that the IRA’s Instagram engagement was the result of click farms; a few of the provided accounts reference what appears to be a live engagement farm.”Set against this backdrop, the study warns that Instagram, which is also owned byMark Zuckerberg's company, is likely to be a key battleground in the future.The themes selected by the IRA were ""deployed to create and reinforce tribalism within each targeted community,"" according to the report, which notes that a majority of posts created by a given Facebook page reinforced in-group camaraderie. Partisan content was also presented to targeted groups in on-brand ways: for example, one meme featured Jesus in a Trump campaign hat on an account targeting Christians.Additionally, the report notes that the IRA co-opted the names of real groups with existing reputations among the targeted communities, including ""United Muslims of America,"" ""Cop Block, Black Guns Matter,"" and ""L for Life."" Researchers said this was possibly an attempt to loosely backstop an identity if a curious individual did a Google Search, or to piggyback on an established brand.TWITTER'S RELEASE OF RUSSIAN, IRANIAN INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN TWEETS SHOWS US VULNERABILITYThe influence campaign began on certain platforms several years ago. The IRA was active on Twitter as early as 2014, prior to their efforts on Facebook and Instagram. However, since the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence only requested data from January 1, 2015, it's possible that some IRA content that appeared on Facebook or Instagram was simply not included in the data provided. The IRA also produced videos across 17 channels on YouTube beginning in September 2015, with most content related to police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement.Meanwhile, a second report produced for the Senate Committee also paints a worrying picture of Russia’s influence campaign.The study by Oxford University’s Computational Propaganda Project and social media analysis specialist Graphika notes the scale of the social media onslaught. “Between 2013 and 2018, the IRA’s Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter campaigns reached tens of millions of users in the United States,” it says. “IRA activities focused on the U.S. began on Twitter in 2013 but quickly evolved into a multi-platform strategy involving Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube amongst other platforms.”Russia’s attempts to sow discord in society have continued long after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to the researchers. “IRA posts on Instagram and Facebook increased substantially after the election, with Instagram seeing the greatest increase in IRA activity.”FACEBOOK'S TIPPING POINT: TECH GIANT GRAPPLES WITH SLOWING GROWTH, CALLS FOR LEADERSHIP SHAKEUPA Facebook spokesperson provided Fox News with the following statement:“Congress and the intelligence community are best placed to use the information we and others provide to determine the political motivations of actors like the Internet Research Agency. We continue to fully cooperate with officials investigating the IRA's activity on Facebook and Instagram around the 2016 election. We've provided thousands of ads and pieces of content to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for review and shared information with the public about what we found. Since then, we've made progress in helping prevent interference on our platforms during elections, strengthened our policies against voter suppression ahead of the 2018 midterms, and funded independent research on the impact of social media on democracy.”A spokesperson from Twitter released the following statement to Fox News:""Our singular focus is to improve the health of the public conversation on our platform, and protecting the integrity of elections is an important aspect of that mission. We’ve made significant strides since 2016 to counter manipulation of our service, including our release of additional data in October related to previously disclosed activities to enable further independent academic research and investigation.”A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the reports, although the company has previouslydescribedpreventing misuse of its platform as a major focus.""This newly released data demonstrates how aggressively Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology, and how the IRA actively worked to erode trust in our democratic institutions,"" Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-NC, said in a statement. ""Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped.""The committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., released a statement that read in part:""These attacks against our country were much more comprehensive, calculating and widespread than previously revealed. That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media.  I hope these reports will spur legislative action in the Congress and provide additional clarity to the American public about Russia’s assault on our democracy.”The report by New Knowledge, Canfield Research and Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, also notes that the efforts by social media platforms to crack down on bots may not be enough.""Now that automation techniques (e.g. bots) are better policed, the near future will be a return to the past: we’ll see increased human-exploitation tradecraft and narrative laundering,"" the report states in its conclusion. ""We should certainly expect to see recruitment, manipulation, and influence attempts targeting the 2020 election, including the inauthentic amplification of otherwise legitimate American narratives, as well as a focus on smaller/secondary platforms and peer-to-peer messaging services.""Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Get a daily look at what’s developing in science and technology throughout the world.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!"

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/guide-congressional-certification-presidential-election,A viewers guide to Wednesday’s congressional certification of the presidential election,"A viewers guide to Wednesday’s joint session of Congress, to formally certify last month’s Electoral College vote in the 2020 presidential election.","January 5, 2021",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss the planned maneuver by lawmakersWednesday’s joint session ofCongress,to formally certify last month’sElectoral Collegevote in the2020 presidential election,is normally a ceremonial event.But this year the quadrennial gathering that’s mandated by the U.S. Constitution is anything but a mere formality – and is expected to be much longer and infinitely more contentious than usual.ON EVE OF CONGRESSIONAL CERTIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, TRUMP SLAMS 'WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE' REPUBLICANSPresident Trumphas repeatedly charged for the past two months that November’s election was ""rigged"" in roughly half a dozen battleground states where he was narrowly edged byPresident-elect Joe Biden. The former vice president topped Trump by more than 7 million votes nationwide and defeated the president by a 306-232 in last month’s Electoral College vote. Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that there was ""massive voter fraud"" in the general election has spurred some of his strongest supporters in Congress – more than 100 House Republicans and at least 13 GOP senators – to say they’ll raise objections to the election results.That will result in both houses of Congress debating and voting on the electoral objections for the first time in 16 years and for only the third time since the passing of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which along with the 12th Amendment to the Constitution governs Wednesday’s Electoral College certification by Congress, which is the final procedural step in the presidential election.While the move by Trump supporters in Congress to raise objections to the presidential election results in states like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin, will slow the proceeding, it’s expected to fall far short. The combined votes of the Democrats in Congress, as well as many Republicans who don’t support Trump’s attempts to overturn the election results, should be more than enough to dismiss the push by the president’s supporters.TRUMP PUTS PRESSURE ON PENCE AHEAD OF ELECTION SHOWDOWN IN CONGRESSHere's how all the action should play out on Wednesday.Under federal law, Congress is mandated to meet on Jan. 6 in a joint session to certify the Electoral College vote. The session, which will begin at 1pm ET, will be presided over byVice President Mike Pence, in his role as president ofthe Senate.He will eventually declare an election winner when the session concludes.The sealed certificates from all 50 states and the District of Columbia – which contain a record of their Electoral College vote – will be brought into the House chamber in mahogany boxes. Bipartisan representatives from both chambers will open the certificates, read the results out loud, and give an official count.After the certificate from a state is read out loud in the chamber, any member of Congress can stand up and object to that state’s Electoral College vote on any grounds. But the presiding officer – which will be Pence -  cannot hear the objection unless it is in writing and signed by at least one House member and one Senate member.BATTLE LINES DRAWN IN GOP OVER TRUMP'S PUSH TO OVERTURN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTSIf there is a joint request – which appears all but certain on Wednesday – the joint session is suspended and both houses of Congress go into separate sessions to debate and vote on those objections. For an objection to succeed, it must be upheld by a majority vote in each chamber, which is extremely unlikely. If one or both houses of Congress vote down the objections, the original electoral vote count is sustained.The last time this happened -  albeit on a much smaller scale - was in January 2005, following President George W. Bush's edging of then-Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts in the Electoral College vote. The election came down to Ohio, which Bush narrowly won.Two Democrats – Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Sen. Barbara Boxer of California - objected to Ohio’s electoral votes, claiming there were irregularities that led to voters being disenfranchised. Both chambers debated the objection and then  rejected it.One thing to watch on Wednesday is attendence. Some members of Congress will likely be absent, and lawmakers cannot vote by proxy.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-parliament-election-sees-right-wing-surge-threat-left-wing-agendas,Right surges in Europe: What to know and what it means for US,"The European Parliament indicates that countries across the continent have seen a rise in right-wing support, especially as immigration and cost of living remain chief issues.",June 21,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"The continent's voters say they are fed up.The success of right-wing parties in therecent European Parliament electionshas shocked the continent and countries around the world, indicating a potential bellwether for the upcoming U.S. presidential election.Voters across the 27 member states that make up the European bloc voted between June 6 and 9, with the results keepingEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’scenter-right European People’s Party (EPP) Group in the majority with 189 of the 720 seats available, but seeing a significant shift from the left to right across the remaining groups.Here's what happened, along with the winners and losers of this surprising electoral result.The results in Europe could indicate a continuing global shift to the right during one of the busiest election years on record: Over 50 countries had elections scheduled this year, even before France announced a snap election due to the European Parliament results,according to the Associated Press.With U.S. politics so tightly poised ahead of the 2024 elections, analysts will look to the other global contests to get some sense as to universal voter sentiments — recalling that the historic and surprise Brexit vote preceded Donald Trump's own surprise victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 — particularly as similar issues appear to trouble both Europeans and Americans despite the Atlantic divide.The successive wins of Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) in the national and European elections, for example, have cemented the Netherlands' shift to the right.Wilders gave up his bidto become prime minister, but seemingly ensured a PVV-led government that will prove to be the country’s most conservative one in decades.Leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV) Geert Wilders speaks to the press after a meeting with Speaker of the House at the House of Representatives in The Hague, on November 24, 2023. After his shock election win, far-right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders on Friday kicked off the formal process of building a government coalition, battling to convince reluctant rivals to serve under him as premier.(Sem van der Wal/ANP/AFP via Getty Images)""The Greens and Liberals are big losers,""Wilders wroteon social media platform X. ""They will lose many seats in the European Parliament. On the other hand, the PVV is winning big, just like our friends in France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal and many other countries. It was a very beautiful election day!""London-based think tank Chatham Housecited immigration as one of the primary issues that right-wing parties have pushed to the forefront of voters' minds. They also cited ""genuine"" grievances about healthcare, housing and an ongoing cost of living crisis as issues that voters had on their minds when they went to the polls this month.Support for Ukraine also remains a key issue, though the think tank warns it is ""perhaps the least controversial foreign policy issue,"" instead focusing on the question of E.U. membership expansion: Russia's invasion prompted Finland and Sweden to break decades-long policies of neutrality and to join the union.The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) gained 21 seats and became the third-biggest European party, and the Rassemblement National (NA) party in France will have 30 seats overall, giving right-wing parties a significant presence in the parliament. Meanwhile, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the liberal Renew Europe, Independent and Democracy (ID) and Greens/European Free Alliance (EFA) each lost over a dozen seats.Much like the U.S. House of Representatives, the number of MEPs depends on the population of their parent country: Austria, for instance, has 20 seats, while Cyprus has only six seats. Germany and France top the count with 96 and 81 seats each, while Italy has 76 seats, Spain has 61, and the Netherlands has 31 seats.Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, co-leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party, celebrate at the AfD election evening gathering following the release of initial election results in European parliamentary elections on June 9, 2024, in Berlin, Germany. Elections to the European Parliament have been taking place since June 6 across European Union member states and are concluding tonight.(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)The ECR will have 83 seats with by far the biggest gains, though media tried to position the EPP’s gains as a bigger story after the party had lost seats in previous elections. ECR also registered strong numbers in Poland, where it gained 20 seats, as a runner-up to EPP, which indicates the divided nature of politics in many European countries.National parties in each country take seats and then filter into one of the parliamentary groups, which means that wins from parties such as Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) — which enters the European Parliament for the first time with 15 seats — and Wilders' PVV, helped bolster ECR’s standing.A party needs at least 23 MEPs from seven member states to have a presence in the European Parliament,according to Reuters. This means that winning even one seat — especially in countries that have only a handful of MEPs to elect — in some countries often proves a vital step in securing a place at the table.In Germany, EPP won its most seats, followed by NA and Greens, while France saw ID take command over S&D and Macron's own party, Renew. Italy gave ECR its biggest win, with S&D the runner-up by only a few seats. Spain gave both EPP and S&D strong support, while the Netherlands virtually provided even support to Renew, EPP and ID each.Politicians on the left have voiced concerns that ECR’s major success has given the right a significant bargaining chip in future policy discussions, with the ruling EPP likely to engage with them as needed to pass its desired legislation and giving the right wing more of a hand in pushing its own agenda.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks during a final media conference at the G7 in Borgo Egnazia, near Bari in southern Italy, Saturday, June 15, 2024.(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)The ECR party is a Eurosceptic party most closely affiliated with the right-wing parties of Italy: Brothers of Italy member Nicola Procaccini has served as chairman of the party since 2019, and the group made its biggest gains in France, Germany and Italy.The party is also closely associated withItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has found herself as an archrival on the continental stage to French President Emmanuel Macron, who also faces a rising tide of right-wing opposition in his home country as Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party — renamed from National Front in 2018 after nearly five decades — seek gains in an upcoming snap election.Macron called a snap election after National Rally took 31.4% of the vote for European Parliament, blowing away any other party, citing a concern that surging support for the party could hinder his remaining term and arguing that an election was the ""most responsible solution,""France24 reported.ECR describes itself as a ""constructive center-right force,""according to Politico: The group also counts Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s party as part of its body, as well as Spain’s far-right Vox party. Romania added five new members to the group, proving once again that every win counts.French far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party President and lead MEP Jordan Bardella waits for the start of an interview on the evening news broadcast of French TV channel TF1, in Boulogne-Billancourt, outside Paris, on June 20, 2024.(Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images)One of the most prominent new faces on the rising right is Jordan Bardella, the president of National Rally, who has served as an MEP since 2019 and has taken a galvanizing role in French politics in the last few years, becomingthe party's ""poster boy,""and he now finds himself poised to become prime minister should his party win the French elections set for July. (Note: France has both a President, Macron, who executes national and international policy and a prime minister who guides the parliamentary agenda and domestic policy.)Bardella has already tried to show a more moderate temperament, turning away from his party's 2022 promise to prioritize a departure from ""the integrated NATO command,"" instead insisting that such a move during wartime would ""considerably weaken France’s responsibility on the European scene and, obviously, its credibility with regard to its allies.""Von der Leyen herself hails from Germany’s Christian Democratic Union, the party of former Prime Minister Angela Merkel, but analysts have warned that if she should retain her role as president of the European Commission, she will need to try and balance the demands of both ends of the political spectrum if she wishes to find success.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSandro Gozi, the leading MEP in Renew, told Politico that he doesn’t believe that ECR’s upswing at the expense of his own party will provide any kind of fundamental change to the parliament’s policies and approach, arguing that the ""pro-European majority"" in the left-wing parties will prove enough to keep things much the same.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.Peter Aitken is a Fox News Digital reporter with a focus on national and global news.Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesias-presidential-election-emerges-key-battleground-us-china-rivalry,Indonesia's presidential election emerges as key battleground in US-China rivalry,Indonesia's upcoming presidential election holds significance for both the U.S. and China due to the country's strategic importance in their regional rivalry.,February 13,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Arthur Leigh Welohr, an American businessman from San Francisco, was arrested in Indonesia after allegedly stabbing his father-in-law to death.When Indonesians cast their votes on Wednesday for a new president in one of the world’s biggest elections, the stakes will also be high for theUnited Statesand China and their mounting rivalry in the region.The Southeast Asian nation is a key battleground economically and politically in a region where the global powers have long been on a collision course over Taiwan, human rights, U.S. military deployments and Beijing’s aggressive actions in disputed waters, including the South China Sea.Outgoing President Joko Widodo’s foreign policy has avoided criticising either Beijing or Washington, but also rejected alignment with either power. The delicate balancing act has paved the way for substantial Chinese trade and investment for Indonesia, including a $7.3 billion high-speed railway that was largely fundedby China, while Jakarta has also boosted defense ties and intensified military exercises with the U.S.HERE’S WHY INDONESIA IS MOVING ITS CAPITAL – AND WHY IT’S SO CONTROVERSIALThese policies would likely continue if election frontrunner Prabowo Subianto, the current defense minister whose vice presidential running mate is Widodo's eldest son, wins, according to analysts.A street vendor pulls his cart past an election banner introducing presidential candidates in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Feb. 1, 2024. When Indonesians cast their votes on Wednesday for a new president in one of the world’s biggest elections, the stakes will also be high for the U.S. and China and their mounting rivalry in the region.(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)""The problem for great powers, however, is that Jakarta is assiduously non-aligned and almost certainly will remain as such regardless of who wins,"" said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at Rand Corp., a U.S.-based think tank.Subianto adheres to a policy of neutrality and has publicly praised the U.S. and China. He cited America’s historical role in pressuring the Netherlands to recognize Indonesian sovereignty in the 1940s, during a forum in November at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Jakarta.INDONESIAN POLICE TO CHARGE SUSPECTS IN MASS-CASUALTY NICKEL PLANT BLAST""This is part of history and we cannot forget this debt of honor,"" said Subianto, who also extolled China’s importance to Southeast Asia. ""China is a great civilization. It has contributed a lot and now it is very, very active and contributing a lot to our economy.""Former Education Minister and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, a presidential candidate who is trailing Subianto in most independent surveys, said he would shift what he called Widodo’s ""transactional"" foreign policy to one anchored on principles if he triumphs in the elections.""When a country invades another country, we can say this is against our basic values. Even though we are friends, if rights were violated, we can reprimand them,"" Baswedan told The Associated Press in an interview last month without saying which country he was alluding to.Baswedan said human rights and environmental protection should underpin Indonesia’s foreign policy. ""If we have no values, then there is a cost-benefit relationship, where we will only support countries that are profitable for us,"" he said.Marty Natalegawa, a respected former Indonesian foreign minister, expressed hope that the new leaders who would be elected would not only say ""we are not picking sides"" but ""actually contribute in helping create a more stable U.S.-China relations.""The U.S. and China have both seen how the emergence of a new leader in the region can threaten their interests.Rodrigo Duterte, after capturing the Philippine presidency on an anti-crime platform in 2016, became one of the most vocal critics in Asia of U.S. security policy while nurturing close ties with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Duterte threatened to evict American military personnel who were in the Philippines for combat exercises. He later moved to terminate a defense agreement with Washington that allowed thousands of Americans to enter the country for largescale combat drills, but he ended that effort as he appealed to the U.S. to provide vaccines at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.Duterte's stormy term ended in 2016 and he was succeeded by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who approved an expansion of the U.S. military presence at Philippine military bases under a 2014 defense pact. Marcos said his decision was aimed at bolstering his country’s territorial defenses at a time of increasing aggression by China's coast guard, navy and suspected militia forces in Philippine-claimed off-shore areas.China protested the decision, saying it would provide American forces staging grounds in the northern Philippines across the sea border from the Taiwan Strait that could undermine Chinese national security.Indonesia and other state members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations belong to the Non-Aligned Movement, a Cold-War era bloc of mostly developing nations that aspire not to be formally associated with or against any major global power.Still, the rivalry between Washington and Beijing has permeated the region.Criticisms of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea have always been watered down in ASEAN, the 10-member regional bloc.AT LEAST 5 ROHINGYA REFUGEE BOATS DETECTED OFF INDONESIAN COASTState members aligned with Beijing, in particular Cambodia and Laos, have opposed any such reproach or attempt to name China as the object of criticism in joint communiques after their annual summits, several regional diplomats have told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity over the years because they lacked authority to speak publicly.Last year, thePhilippine governmentaccused the Chinese coast guard and suspected militia forces of using water cannons, a military-grade laser and dangerous maneuvers against Philippine coast guard patrol ships that caused minor collisions in a series of high-seas faceoffs in the disputed waters.Under the chairmanship of Indonesia, ASEAN did not specifically mention China but only made general expressions of concern over aggressive behavior in the disputed waterway after their summit meetings.Fox News' Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.""By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

The calls to exit the race come after Biden displayed a disastrous debate performance against Trump last month, reigniting concerns over his mental fitness and age.Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the '90s NBC drama ""West Wing,"" suggested on Sunday that theDemocratic Party nominate a Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, to stop former President Donald Trump.Back in 2012, Sorkin lobbied Obama to repeatedly call Romney a liar at debates. ""Nominating Mr. Romney would be putting our money where our mouth is: a clear and powerful demonstration that this election isn’t about what our elections are usually about, but about stopping a deranged man from taking power,"" Sorkin touted in an op-ed for the New York Times, before noting other Democrats weren't polling well against Trump either.President Biden is facing mounting calls to drop out of the race following a rocky debate performance. A recent poll also found that 65% of Democrats want Biden to drop out.""The problem in the real world is that there isn’t a Democrat who is polling significantly better than Mr. Biden. And quitting, as heroic as it may be in this case, doesn’t really put a lump in our throats,"" he wrote.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesFailed 2024 Democratic candidate for the White House, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, said he encouragesPresident Biden to drop out ofhis re-election race, adding to the growing list of Democrats calling on the president to end his campaign.""The president did call me in March, a very gracious conversation, and I did endorse him, and I still endorse him. But it is time to step aside and turn this over to a new generation. My endorsement stays until he makes that decision. I'm encouraging that,"" Phillips said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday morning.Phillips is the 37th Democrat to publicly call on Biden to bow out of the race since last month.""I ran because I saw a delusion. I saw a country that was in a very different place than our Democratic Party. Over 50% of Democrats at that time wanted a different candidate. And I was on a mission to expose the truth, provide an alternative, and do what I really saw in the numbers and through intuition was necessary. It didn't work out, of course, but I was trying to create the conversation,"" Phillips added in his interview.Phillips bowedout of the presidential racein March, after months of noting that while he admired the president, Biden’s age weakened the chance of Democrats retaining control of the White House in 2024.Phillips announced in November of last year that he would not seek re-election for his House seat, after throwing his hat in the presidential race.

The calls to drop out were born out of anxiety following Biden's disastrous presidential debate last month, when his mental fitness and age came under further scrutiny.KENT NISHIMURA/AFP via Getty ImagesFormer President Barack Obama potentially directly calling onPresident Bidento drop out of the 2024 race could drive him to remain in the election rematch against Trump, according to a new report.Current and former Biden aides told Axios that the president still holds a grudge against Obama and Democrats for advising he not run for president in 2016, just months after his son Beau Biden died from brain cancer. The regret over not running that year has reportedly emboldened Biden to remain in the race despite calls from traditional allies to drop out.The report noted that ifObama directly called onBiden to drop out of his 2024 run, it could push the president to become more determined to remain the nominee.""Obama already used that chit in 2016 when his team lobbied him against running. You don't get to do that more than once,"" one former Biden aide told the outlet.Former President Donald Trump's running mate in the 2024 election,JD Vance, doubled downthat President Biden should resign from the White House is he bows out of the presidential race.""If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President? Not running for reelection would be a clear admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough to serve as Commander-in-Chief,"" Vance posted on X Sunday morning.""There is no middle ground.""The Ohio Republican senator was announced as Trump's vice presidential pick last week, and had previously called onBiden to resign as presidentif he bows out of the race.""Everyone calling on Joe Biden to *stop running* without also calling on him to resign the presidency is engaged in an absurd level of cynicism. If you can't run, you can't serve,"" he wrote on Saturday.Calls have mounted since June 27 for Biden to end his re-election run, following his disastrous debate performance that put his mental fitness and age under further scrutiny as the Democratic Party squares up for a rematch against Trump.President Biden took to X Sunday and vowed to keep speaking out for Democracy as calls for him to step down have intensified.""I’ll continue to speak out strongly for our democracy, stand up for our Constitution and the rule of law, and call for action at the ballot box, not violence on our streets,"" Biden said.

Democrats said the Biden campaign pulled in millions following the debate despite the president's performance and concerns he could defeat Trump in November.Republicans, however, are anticipated to continueoutraising Democrats in July, touting a three-month fundraising winning streak, pulling in a staggering$331 million during the April through June.Biden has remained adamant he is remaining in the race despite a wave of Democrat allies increasingly calling on him to drop out of the race and speculation that Biden is considering his allies' demands ahead of the Democratic National Convention.President Biden is expressing new interest in whether Vice President Kamala Harris could defeat former President Trump in the 2024 election, according to a report from the New York Times.While Biden and his staff have publicly insisted that he is staying in the race, the 81-year-old is reportedly now asking whether Harris could win. Several polls show Harris matching or even exceedingBiden's performance against Trumpas waves of Democrats call on Biden to withdraw.“To some degree, the vice president is auditioning now for the job and they should help her lean in and I think her leaning in could be beneficial to bolstering Biden” whether he steps aside or not, former Harris aid Ashley Etienne told the Times.Harris stands as the most obvious candidate to replace Biden thanks in large part to her presumed access to the Biden-Harris war chest should the president withdraw.

While President Biden has not yet released a blueprint for how to address the upcoming tax cliff, he called for a number of tax hikes in his fiscal 2025 budget proposal.""Taxes are a huge part. We've got to have competitive taxes. In the U.S., we've got the most regressive tax regime in the world relative to R&D,"" Ramirez told Fox News' Pete Hegseth.The Husco CEO gave Hegseth a behind-the-scenes look into the company's manufacturing headquarters in Waukesha, Wisconsin, as the Republican National Convention got underway in nearby Milwaukee.The U.S.'s federal research and development (R&D) tax credit grants companies a reduction in tax liability for select domestic expenses.""R&D and innovation is how we grow this economy, how we grow Husco. Today in the U.S., we get to expense 20% of our R&D expenses in China. They get to expense 200% of their R&D expenses.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-wins-presidency-trump-fox-news-projects,"Biden wins presidency, Trump denied second term in White House, Fox News projects","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has defeated incumbent President Donald Trump, Fox News projects.","November 7, 2020",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Democratic presidential nomineeJoe Bidenhas defeated PresidentTrump, denying him a second term after a bitter campaign and dramatic, prolonged vote count in battleground states that sparked a flurry of lawsuits.The Fox News Decision Desk projected Saturday that Biden will win the state of Nevada and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, giving the former vice president the electoral votes he needs to win the White House.ELECTION 2020 LIVE UPDATES: FOX NEWS PROJECTS BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY""I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris,"" Biden said in a statement. ""In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America.""He added: ""With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.""Biden's campaign announced that the president-elect and Harris, his running mate, will speak at an event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware at 8 p.m. ET.A year and a half after launching his White House bid, Biden secured enough states to put him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes and bring an end to the four game-changing years of the Trump presidency, according to the Fox News projections. For Trump, the defeat comes four years after a stunning upset – when he came from behind in 2016 and outperformed the polls in a victory against Hillary Clinton.But in a statement Saturday, Trump did not concede and instead vowed to continue to fight.“The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,” the president said.“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,” Trump added.The president has launched a number of legal challenges over ballot counting in key battleground states, with his campaign filing suits in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada as the states continue to tally ballots sent by mail. Trump, his campaign and surrogates have spread allegations of fraud in the voting and ballot counting in various states, although solid proof of it has not emerged.In addition, Georgia’s secretary of state signaled Friday that the state is headed toward a recount, given the razor-thin margin of votes there favoring Biden.Biden, taking to Twitter after the projections, said “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans — whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.”And Biden added “President-Elect” to the description on his Twitter page.Harris, who will become the first female vice president and first person of color to serve as vice president, tweeted “We did it.” The senator from California’s tweet included a short video of her on a phone call congratulating Biden.On Friday, the former vice president touted the record-breaking 74 million votes for the Democratic ticket and emphasized that ""the people spoke loudly for our ticket.""Biden highlighted that a ""record number of Americans of all races, faiths, religions, chose change over more of the same. They’ve given us a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, climate change, systemic racism. They’ve made it clear they want the country to come together.""But many Republicans question the strength of Biden's mandate.Trump won more than 70 million votes, and as of late Friday night Biden's national popular vote margin over the president stood at just under 3 points.And while Biden moved closer to winning the White House, the Democrats' chances of retaking the Senate majority remained slim. Democrats did hold onto control of the House but failed to meet expectations of padding their majority.About an hour after the news networks projected Biden’s presidential election victory, he received a congratulatory call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader.With strong focus on coronavirus since the worst pandemic in a century swept across the nation eight months ago, Biden was able to keep the spotlight on the president’s record, largely preventing Trump from making the 2020 campaign a choice election.Amid national protests and unrest over racial inequity and another nasty Supreme Court nomination battle in the closing days of the campaign, Biden kept his eye on the pandemic and an economy hit hard by it.TRUMP VOWS TO KEEP ‘FIGHTING,’ WILL USE ‘EVERY ASPECT OF THE LAW’ IN BALLOT-COUNTING BATTLEBiden, who laid low for the first couple of months after the pandemic forced Americans to self-isolate, was ridiculed by the president, who claimed he was “hiding” in his basement at his home in Wilmington, Del.But ultimately the strategy worked -- keeping the electorate’s focus on the president's handling of the worsening crisis. Also highlighting Trump’s divisive style of governing, the Democrat pledged to be a uniter willing to reach across the aisle to find common ground.Biden was able to resist withering attacks by Trump and his surrogates over his record in politics stretching nearly half a century. He also deflected a barrage of attacks targeting him and his son, Hunter, that accused the Biden family of unsubstantiated “corruption.”The road ahead for the president-elect, who will soon turn 78, will be far from easy.He must cope with titanic challenges never faced to this magnitude by an incoming commander in chief. Compounding the enormous task ahead, Biden likely will have to deal with a Republican Party that may be in no mood to compromise – and with a progressive base of his own party that will almost certainly try to push the incoming president to the left.Biden’s victory comes five years after he passed on a White House run, as he reeled from the death of his eldest son, Beau. A year later, Clinton narrowly lost numerous key battleground states to Trump due in part to a drop in support from White working class voters as well as a lack of enthusiasm from Black and Latino voters.But Biden – who’s long been known as “Middle Class Joe” because of his roots growing up in a working-class family in Scranton, Pa., and later in Delaware, and who served for eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, America’s first Black president -- was able to succeed where Clinton failed.For Biden, who made unsuccessful White House bids in 1988 and 2008, the third time was the charm.BIDEN TRANSITION TEAM'S WORK UNDERWAY""The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America is at stake,” Biden said as he announced his candidacy for president in April of last year, ending months of intrigue and media speculation.Biden entered a record-setting, jam-packed field of contenders for the nomination and repeatedly took attacks from his more progressive rivals over his stance on the issues and his record during his four-plus decades as a senator from Delaware and vice president in the Obama administration. During summer and fall 2019, Biden was in the line of fire as the front-runner in the race.Biden, who had struggled with fundraising since his campaign launch, saw his standing in the polls deteriorate at the end of last year and early this year, as progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, soared. The former vice president appeared on the ropes in February, after disappointing showings in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the first two contests in the presidential nomination calendar.But a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary on the last day of February, followed by sweeping victories three days later in the coast-to-coast Super Tuesday contests, vaulted Biden back to front-runner status.Most of his rivals quickly dropped out of the race as moderates and establishment Democrats rallied around Biden. After a continued streak of primary victories in March and early April, Sanders – Biden’s last rival for the nomination – ended his bid and endorsed his rival.Biden entered a general election contest against Trump badly behind the GOP incumbent in the crucial fundraising and campaign organization metrics. At the same time, the White House race instantly was upended as the pandemic swept the nation, forcing millions to self-isolate and shuttering major parts of the economy, triggering the worst recession since the Great Depression eight decades ago.GEORGIA SENATE RACE: PERDUE, OSSOFF HEAD TO RUNOFF AFTER HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGNAs Biden was working to unite the Democrats following a bruising primary, the general showdown between him and Trump instantly became a referendum on the president’s handling of the pandemic and the economy, giving Biden a race he could win.Biden spent the remainder of the spring, summer and fall continuously pillorying the president’s efforts to combat the coronavirus and revive the economy, and spelling out his proposals.The president had been raising money for his reelection ever since he took over the White House in January 2017, and he enjoyed a massive early fundraising advantage. As Trump started airing ads on TV in the key battlegrounds, Biden remained dark. The Democrat didn’t make his first major ad buy on television until the middle of June.But thanks in part to a surge in fundraising in late spring through summer, including record-shattering campaign cash hauls in August and September, Biden dramatically outraised the president as the general election heated up -- and he outspent Trump on TV ads the past three months. In the digital ad wars, Biden also enjoyed a slight spending advantage.Biden held his own in both presidential debates – disproving the repeated attacks by Trump and his campaign questioning the 77-year old nominee’s mental acuity. And, Trump’s brief hospitalization after contracting COVID-19, as well an autumn surge in the coronavirus in key states across the country, kept the campaign’s spotlight firmly on an issue that did no favors for the president’s reelection chances.The final stretch of the campaign saw Biden playing offense and the president on defense – with most of the campaign stops in states Trump narrowly captured in 2016.Biden’s closing themes were the same as those he used when he announced his candidacy.""The heart and soul of this country’s at stake,” Biden told Florida voters during a stop in Broward County last week as he promised to bring compassion and empathy back to the White House.And, Biden continued to emphasize his goal to unite the nation, repeatedly stressing that “I’m running as a proud Democrat but I’ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of the president: a duty of caring, caring for everyone.”Taking aim at the president’s war of words with many of the nation’s leading public health officials, Biden highlighted that “we choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, and we choose science over fiction, and yes, we choose truth over lies.”Biden now has two and a half months to assemble a cabinet and top officials who instantly will have to cope with the biggest challenges ever faced by an incoming president and administration – from the worst pandemic to strike the world in a century, and the worst economic recession to grip the nation since The Great Depression eight decades ago.Biden will be squeezed from both sides – by reeling Republicans who may look to run the same playbook that stymied President Obama and Biden as they took over in the White House in 2009. But, he’ll also face pressure from his left flank.The left will be looking for top progressives to land leading roles in Biden’s administration, and will be pushing hard to implement their agenda on the economy, social justice, civil rights and judicial reform, and on combating climate change.Firebrand lawmakers on the left – such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – kept the peace during the general election, but with the Democrats’ common foe now defeated – infighting may soon commence, with the left scrutinizing every move by a politician firmly planted in the center-left of the party.Also hovering over Biden: questions over his durability and whether he’ll run for re-election in four years. The last thing the president-elect needs at the onset of his tenure in the White House is to be collared with lame-duck status.Biden hasn’t ruled out seeking a second term. Asked in August if he was open to running for re-election, he said “absolutely,” in an interview with ABC News.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

An official said that U.S. spy agencies ""observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election,"" likely because Iranian leaders want to avoid escalating any conflicts with the U.S.The regime is allegedly using ""vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills,"" to spread disinformation. Though the ODNI did not explicitly say that Iran was aiming at Trump, an official said they ""haven’t observed a shift in Iran’s preferences"" since 2020, meaning that Tehran was still targeting the Republican candidate.Speaking to Fox News Digital on Tuesday,Pompeosaid that he was not surprised by Iran's attempts to influence the election.

The compact would take effect only if supporters secure pledges from states with at least 270 electoral votes.""Gov. Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College and he is honored to be traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket,"" a spokesperson for the Harris/Walz campaign told Fox News Digital. ""He was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes. And, he was thanking them for their support that is helping fund those efforts.""The Electoral College comprises a certain number of electors from each state who cast votes for the president and vice president. In 48 states and Washington, D.C., whichever candidate receives the most ballots in their favor is awarded all the electoral votes for that state. Maine and Nebraska assign their electors using a proportional system.The winner needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidential election.""Dangerously liberal Tim Walz made it crystal clear: the Harris-Walz administration will get rid of the Electoral College, a critical component of our Constitution. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to destroy our country’s fundamental rights by ripping away our freedom of speech through censorship, taking away our 2nd Amendment right, dismantling the Supreme Court by through court-packing, and now through removing the Electoral College,"" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign national press secretary, told Fox News Digital in a statement.""Demolishing the Electoral College is every radical leftist’s dream because it will allow the coastal elites to determine our elections silencing the voice of hardworking Americans,"" she added.The Electoral College was created by the Founding Fathers in an effort to make sure large states didn't dominate small ones in presidential elections or wield too much power.

Recent examples cited include former President Trump's 2016 win over Hillary Clinton, in which she won the popular vote but received fewer electoral votes.In 2000, former President George W. Bush lost the popular vote but narrowly won the electoral vote. Many Republicans have argued against getting rid of the Electoral College system, saying such a move would result in states with larger populations having undue influence.Others argue it would cause presidential candidates to focus on a few states during the campaign season while ignoring others.In 2012, Trump panned theelectoral system, calling it ""a disaster for a democracy.""

That’s what America stands for. But I also know this: what unites Democrats and Republicans and Independents is a love for America.”Although Haley came out on top in just one contest on Tuesday, recent polls suggest large portions of voters supporting her say they were motivated by their opposition to Trump, and that they might not shift their support to him as the Republican nominee in November.Biden is making an active play for those supporters, hoping that if Trump will be unable to form a coalition that can deliver 270 Electoral College votes in November.Fox News Digital's Brandon Gillespie contributed to this update.Nikki Haley speaks as she announces she is suspending her campaign, in Charleston, South Carolina, March 6, 2024.

I live in Virginia. Immigration was the number one issue,"" as Reid laughed.Maddow added, ""Well, Virginia does have a border with West Virginia,"" as others on the panel laughed.Former President Trump carried Virginia easily Tuesday night as part of a string of primary victories over Nikki Haley, cementing his status as the GOP frontrunner. The panel referred to exit polls that showed immigration as a top priority for Republican voters.""You're thinking like, what?"" Psaki said. ""Trump has indoctrinated people with this fear of people who do not look like them being a threat to them.""Maddow complained that every election cycle, especially when a Democrat is in office, ""we get reminded about the borders,"" although Republicans have blasted Biden's border policies for years as record-breaking numbers of migrants have crossed into the United States under his administration.""You make these things an issue, you make them into boogeymen… as long as there's a Democratic incumbent to blame on it,"" she said. The panel was critical of Trump's role in torpedoing bipartisan border legislation this year, saying he didn't want a solution to the problem.Fox News Digital's David Rutz and Jeffrey Clark contributed to this update.Nikki Haley campaign surrogate Rep.Ralph Norman, R-S.C., reacted to the news that the former South Carolina governor and U.N. Ambassador would suspend her presidential campaign on Wednesday morning.Norman told ""Fox & Friends"" the timing was ""right"" for Haley to drop out after she lost 14 of 15 Super Tuesday primary contests to Trump, only winning Vermont by a narrow margin.""The democratic process played out. And, you know, the people have spoken,"" Norman said. ""I do think she will fully endorse President Trump. If not, you know, today, she will because we've got a country to save. This is bigger than anything we have ever seen. This isn't about personalities. This is really about saving America.""With Haley to bow out of the race at 10:00 a.m. ET in a speech delivered in Charleston, Norman said he will endorse Trump and support him in the November general election.""Donald Trump can save this country,"" Norman said.President Biden overwhelmingly won the Democratic contests on Super Tuesday, with one notable exception —American Samoa.The American territory, an island located in the South Pacific Ocean, voted for an unlikely Democratic candidate named Jason Palmer, a 52-year-old businessman from Baltimore.Out of 91 ballots cast in the territory's caucus, Palmer won 51 and Biden won 40, according to the local party. The upset will not derail Biden’s march toward his party’s nomination, but it marks the second time the American territory has rejected Biden.During the 2020 Democratic primaries, billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s only win came in American Samoa. He garnered 175 votes in the contest with Tulsi Gabbard coming second with 103 votes. Bernie Sanders earned 37 votes and Biden came fourth with 31.After Tuesday’s caucus, Palmer thanked American Samoa in a message on X.""Honored to announce my victory in the American Samoa presidential primary.

Trump secured his place as the presumptive Republican nominee after winning 14 of the 15 Super Tuesday states, with the lone exception of Vermont. His last remaining challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, will suspend her presidential campaign at 10:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday.Biden's team argues Trump is weakened by the primary fight and strapped for cash as Republicanspivot to the general election.""In January, Trump’s campaign raised $8.8 million while spending around $11.5 million, ending the month $2.6 million in the hole. His super PAC is further in the hole: in the entire month of January, it spent more than it raised. If it couldn’t get any worse, the national Republican Party that will serve as the backbone of his general election campaign is in complete disarray: 2023 was the RNC’s worst fundraising year in almost a decade,"" the memo states.""And we’ve yet to mention what appears to be an issue that will not go away this cycle: Trump’s political operation has had to shell out several million per month on legal costs — an amount that accounted for approximately one-third of their total spending last year with that number expected to get even worse.""WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 29: U.S. President Joe Biden walks across the South Lawn before boarding the Marine One presidential helicopter and departing the White House on February 29, 2024 in Washington, DC.

Biden Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez authored the document, which outlined the campaign's view of the state of the race.""The results of last night’s Super Tuesday contests cemented what we have known for some time now: Donald Trump limps into the general election as a wounded, dangerous and unpopular candidate,"" the memo states. ""The Republican nominee is cash-strapped, beleaguered by a host of external issues, and is running on an extreme agenda that is already proving to be a significant liability for key voting blocs that are critical to the pathway to 270 electoral votes.""The Biden campaign asserts that the primaries have demonstrated how Trump is struggling to unify a coalition needed to win 270 Electoral College votes. Though Trump won all the Super Tuesday primaries except for Vermont, the memo points to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's significant share of the GOP primary vote in several states. Dillon and Rodriguez argue that even though Haley has no path to the nomination, a significant number of Republicans are still refusing to back Trump.""A significant share of moderate and Haley voters across the country are saying that Trump cannot count on their votes in a general election,"" the memo states.In contrast, the Biden-Harris campaign ""heads into the general election coming off of consistent wins up and down the ballot, maintains a historic and growing grassroots-powered war chest, and now adds a strong Super Tuesday showing last night to enter the general election well-prepared and well-positioned to win this November.""Insurgent Republicans won big victories inthe Texas primarieson Tuesday, unseating six incumbent state House lawmakers who had opposed Gov.

Ernest Bailes. ""Our district is home to one of the largest, if not the largest illegal immigrant population in the country. And it is ground zero here and the open border is terrible here ... the people that live in our district were fed up with our incumbent not doing anything. He's been in office for eight years and they were tired and scared and they wanted change.""LaHood agreed that the border was the ""number one"" for voters in his primary. Kerwin, who will advance to a runoff, said voters in her district were looking for more conservative leadership.Fox Newschief political analyst Brit Humeis not surprised by the growing concerns about President Biden's age and mental acuity – he believes they have been a ""ticking time bomb.""Asked on Super Tuesday whether he could have envisioned months ago current polls showing independent voters leaning toward former President Trump on a number of issues, Hume chalked it up at least in part to President Biden's cognizance.""I was saying back when it was not at all fashionable to say it, that he is senile. And now I think he is palpably senile and the country sees it,"" Hume said on ""Special Report"" as Super Tuesday polls prepared to close in 15 states and American Samoa.Hume said a major challenge for Biden lies later in the week when he will give the annual State of the Union on Thursday, highlighting that the president must prove to Americans that he is not too old for the job.Biden has been dogged by several news-making gaffes in recent weeks, including a reference to Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi as the ""president of Mexico"" while discussing the Israel-Gaza conflict, and instances where he recounted talking to former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President François Mitterrand several years after they died.The president also caused a stir after a Connecticut speech on gun control in 2023, when he closed his remarks with ""God Save the Queen, man.""

Anything less than that will end in a contested convention where candidates will jockey for delegates live and in person. Certain states have winner take all systems, where whoever gets the most delegates wins them all, while most have proportional delegate systems, candidates get a number of delegates based on the percentage of votes they secure.Currently, former President Donald Trump sits at 122 delegates compared to former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley’s 24 delegates.

Jamie Raskin, D., Md., announced that he will be reintroducing a prior bill with Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., to disqualify not justformer President Donald Trumpbut a large number of Republicans from taking office.The alternative, it appears, is unthinkable: allowing the public to choose their next president and representatives in Congress. It appears that the last thing Democrats want is for the unanimous decision to actually lead to an outbreak of democracy. Where the Court expressly warned of ""chaos"" in elections, Raskin and others appear eager to be agents of chaos in Congress.Soon after the decision, Raskin went on CNN to assure people that he and his colleagues would not stand by and allow the right to vote to be restored to citizens in the upcoming election. He pledged to reintroduce a prior bill that would declare Jan. 6 an ""insurrection"" and that those involved ""engaged in insurrection.""I previously wrote about these ""ballot cleansing"" efforts because it would not just disqualify Trump but potentially dozens of sitting Republican members of Congress. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., sought to bar 126 members of Congress under the same theory. Similar legislation offered by Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., to disqualify members got 63 co-sponsors, all Democrats.Raskin's participation in this effort is crushingly ironic. In 2016, he sought to block certification of the 2016 election under the very same law as violent protests were occurring before the inauguration.McConnell is currently the highest-ranking Republican in Congress who has yet to endorse Trump's return to the White HouseSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell could endorse former President Donald Trump in the 2024 race as one of his last major actions before leaving leadership.McConnell's officeand Trump's presidential campaign have been in talks over a possible endorsement, as well as a strategy to unite Republicans just eight months away from the November election, according to The Associated Press, citing a person familiar with the situation.McConnell is currently the highest-ranking Republican in Congress who has yet to back the former president's bid to return to the White House.Any potential endorsement comes as Trump is competing with former South Carolina Gov.

And in Vermont, she was joined by anti-Trump Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who has endorsed her White House bid.If Haley does well in both states, it could be a sign there's still some life left in her challenge against Trump.But a poor showing in Vermont and Virginia would be a strong indicator that Trump will run the table on Super Tuesday.Kaylee McGhee White sat down with ""Fox & Friends First"" hosts Carley Shimkus and Todd Piro to analyze the highly anticipated Republican race today betweenNikki Haleyand Donald Trump.Piro outlined the question that is on much of America's mind -- why is Haley still in the race?""She's vowed to stay,"" he said.

""She knows that she is not going to get enough delegates today, or any other day, to beat Donald Trump.

During 1980, seven primaries and caucuses were held in early March, according to the National Constitution Center.The website highlights that the special day was “used to describe the final Tuesday of the primary season in June, when a key group of states thatincluded Californiaand New Jersey cast votes.” Then in 1984, nine states participated and by 1988, the day was known as Southern Super Tuesday due to 21 states, a majority from the South, holding elections in March that year.Now there are multiple “mini-Super Tuesday” events that come after the Super Tuesday in March.Trump is hoping to push Nikki Haley out of the race on TuesdayDonald Trump won't clinch the 2024 Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday.But with the former president likely to capture the lion's share of the 854 Republican delegates up for grabs when 15 states hold GOP primaries or caucuses on what'sknown as Super Tuesday,Trump is expected to move significantly closer to locking up his party's presidential nomination over his last remaining rival – Nikki Haley.""It’s big stuff and it’s the single most important primary day of the year,"" Trump told his supporters in a video posted on social media ahead of Super Tuesday.Trump has swept all but one of the first nine contests on the GOP nominating calendar, including North Dakota's Republican presidential caucuses on the eve of Super Tuesday.Another strong showing by the former president in Tuesday's coast-to-coast primaries and caucuses will help him in his mission to completely pivot from a primary battle with Haley to a general election rematch withPresident Biden,who defeated Trump four years ago to win the White House.""If every single conservative, Republican, and Trump supporter in these states shows up on Super Tuesday, we will be very close to finished with this primary contest,"" Trump emphasized. ""Republicans will then be able to focus all of our energy, time, and resources, on defeating crooked Joe Biden.""This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Paul SteinhauserAmericans are frustrated with the economy headed into Super TuesdayVoters are headed to the polls on the biggest primary election day of the 2024 cycle with one issue in particular at the top of their minds: the state of the U.S. economy.About one-third of Americans think thateconomic problemsare the most important issue facing the country today, according to a monthly poll published by Gallup. That includes 12% of voters who are worried about the economy in general and 11% who identified the high cost of living and ongoing inflation crisis as the top problem in the country.Another 3% expressed concern about the steep federal budget deficit, while 2% said taxes.By comparison, 28% of Americans said that immigration is the No. 1 problem, while 20% said the top issue is the government and poor leadership. Another 6% identified poverty and homelessness as the biggest problems.The findings come ahead of Super Tuesday, the day in the presidential primary cycle when many states vote. More than one-third of Republican delegates are up for grabs in the 15 states that are voting on Tuesday. About a third of Democratic delegates will also be decided, with nominating contests in 14 states plus American Samoa.Former President Trump,the GOP frontrunner, is widely expected to dominate the races, as he goes up against the last standing Republican challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. President Biden, as the incumbent and only major candidate for the Democrats, is also likely to sweep the races.This is an excerpt from an article by Fox Business' Megan HenneyRestoring America Editor Kaylee McGhee White joined ""Fox & Friends First"" hosts Carley Shimkus and Todd Piro early Tuesday morning.McGhee White touched onNikki Haley'scontinued participation in the presidential primary race and what it could mean for her future with Republicans.""Nikki Haley is not predicting victory in any single one of the states that heads to the polls today, but she's still insisting that she's going to stay in the race anyway,"" she said.""And you know, I may be young, but I am old enough to remember the last female politician who came along, who also belittled her primary opponent by saying that he couldn't win a general election, that no one liked him, and that candidate's name wasHillary Clinton,"" McGhee White added. ""So, Nikki Haley has a choice to make here. She could end up being just as despised as Hillary Clinton if she continues down this road, or she could drop out now and save some of her dignity in the Republican party.""Ron Sachs/CNP/Getty ImagesEvery election cycle there is one detrimental Tuesday that makes or breaks presidential campaigns -Super Tuesday.Since the late 1970s, Super Tuesday has worked to lock in the nominations of presidential candidates, including former President George H.W. Bush who won 16 out of 17 states in the 1989 primary election, as well as former President Bill Clinton in 1992.Super Tuesday usually sees around 10 states holding primaries on the same night. On Super Tuesday in 2008, however, history was made when 24 states held primaries on the same Tuesday in February.In the weeks ahead of Super Tuesday in 2020, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was seemingly leading the Democrat presidential primary contest, however, then-candidate Joe Biden’s campaign made an unexpected comeback. The now-president had lost the Iowa,New Hampshire, and Nevada primary races, but went on to win 10 Super Tuesday states. This boost in his campaign quickly led to him securing the Democrat nomination and eventually winning the presidency.Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., entered the 2020 presidential race with momentum stemming from his 2016 run and early wins, but his Super Tuesday results changed the trajectory of his entire campaign.In 2016, while Sanders trailed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he secured wins in several vital states and was expected to perform going into his 2020 campaign.Sanders nearly tied withPete Buttigiegfor the Iowa 2020 caucus, with a 0.1% difference, the state that used to kick off of the Democrat nomination calendar. Sanders then secured a win in both the New Hampshire and Nevada caucuses.In his home state of Vermont, however, where Sanders won 86% of the vote over Hillary Clinton four years prior, the progressive only won 50% of the vote.While Sanders appeared to be in the run for the Democrat nomination, he did not perform well on Super Tuesday despite major 2016 victories.Despite Sanders carrying the Super Tuesday states over Clinton in 2016, now-president Biden was named the victor of 10 states on the primary night.Sanders suspended his campaign just one month later in April.Getty ImagesAs we continue to see results pour in on this Super Tuesday for the2024 presidential election, let’s look at the results back in 2020.In 2020, Super Tuesdaytook place on March 3, and then-former Vice President Joe Biden won 10 primaries and received 650 pledged delegates, according to U.S. Election Atlas.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., won four primaries and received 556 delegates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., won 0 primaries and received 76 delegates. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard won 0 primaries but received 2 delegates. Michael Bloomberg won one primary, gaining 60 delegates, however he eventually dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden, according to U.S. Election Atlas.Around 40% of the United States held primary events on thatSuper Tuesday, according to Ballotpedia.Former President Donald Trump ran unopposed for the Republican primary in Maine and Minnesota. A couple of his opponents were Joe Walsh and Bill Weld. Trump ended up winning 13 states.PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP via Getty ImagesThe 2024 presidential contenders are gearing up for one the defining nights of the presidentialprimary election, known as Super Tuesday.On a Tuesday, normally held in February or March, several states hold presidential primaries or caucuses. These events help determine the candidates who will appear on the ballot for the general election later in the year. This cycle, 15 states and one U.S. territory will vote for their preferred nominees in the 2024 presidential election.A Super Tuesday ""win"" means one candidate from each of the two political parties will secure a number of valuable delegates. Whoever wins the majority of delegates is likely to become their party’s nominee.Historically, any remaining candidates in the field who failed to secure enough statewide wins will bow out of the race shortly after and the party will begin to back a single candidate as the nominee.Alabama, Alaska (Republican only), Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and the U.S. territory of American Samoa will all be participating inSuper Tuesdayprimary voting.Photographer: Sam Wolfe/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesTheSouth Carolinapresidential primary took place on Saturday, February 24, between former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley on the Republican ticket. President Biden functionally ran unopposed and captured 96% of the vote when the Democrats held their primary.South Carolina was highly anticipated to see how Haley’s name recognition as former governor would fare against Trump’s immense lead among GOP voters. Ultimately, Trump won with 60% of the vote compared to Haley’s 40%. This was comparable to Trump’s past victories in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.Haley remained defiant,insisting that an incumbent president losing 40% of the vote is evidence he can’t defeat Biden in November.""Donald Trump as, technically, the Republican incumbent did not win 40% of the vote,"" Haley said to reporters during her campaigning in Michigan.

While thegeneral electionhas some regulation from the federal government – like mandating that the election takes place on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November – primaries are well and truly governed by the state parties.As such, parties will often jockey to have their state vote during strategically important times to try and maximize their influence on the presidential nomination process.Enter Super Tuesday.Why the day matters is simple: over 30% of the delegates that are available to win will be up for grabs on a single day. Primary campaigns often live and die off of Super Tuesday.Prior to this recent trend, “Super Tuesday” used to refer to the last Tuesday of theelection cycle, when big states like California were in play. However, since 2008, in an effort by parties to avoid politically bloody and costly primary elections, more and more states started frontloading their election dates in an effort to select a nominee early.Photo by Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty ImagesPresidentJoe Bidenwon 10 out of 15 states on Super Tuesday in 2020, ultimately securing his lead in the Democratic presidential primary race.Ahead of Biden's night of wins, Vermont Sen.

Around 595 delegates were reported by Ballotpedia to be allocated to Republican candidates.Trump won 7 primaries in the 2016 Super Tuesday. Sen.Ted Cruzwon 3 primaries and gained 245 delegates. Sen. Marco Rubio won one primary and received 97 delegates. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich won 0 primaries and gained 21 delegates. Ben Carson won 0 primaries and received 3 delegates.For the Democrats, Ballotpedia reports that around 865 delegates were to be allocated by the presidential candidates.Hillary Clintonwon 8 primaries and allocated 517 delegates, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., won 4 primaries and received 347 delegates.Florida Rep.Byron Donaldsjoined ""Fox News Sunday"" with Shannon Bream this weekend to discuss Super Tuesday.""Donald Trump overwhelmingly won every single state,"" Donalds said.

In an average post 2008 election year, upwards of 20% of available delegates are up for grabs.In 2020, Super Tuesday was instrumental in securingPresident Joe Biden’svictory. Up until then, Biden had been struggling in early-voting states. But the day before Super Tuesday, many moderate Democrats dropped out and endorsed Biden. Biden swept 10 out of the 14 states, winning 53% of the delegates and solidifying his victory as the Democratic nominee.In 2016 there were two days that the media deemed “Super Tuesday I & II”. On Super Tuesday I almost half of the remaining delegates required for victory were up for grabs, but on Super Tuesday II four states with winner-take-all delegate distribution were up for grabs.FormerPresident Trumpwon a plurality of delegates on Super Tuesday I and a majority on Super Tuesday II, all but locking down the nomination for him.Photo by Montinique Monroe/Getty ImagesPresidential primaries, which are entirely run by state parties, are prone to changes based on the current political winds.ForSuper Tuesday2024, candidates face an intimidating gauntlet of 16 states and territories including Alabama, Alaska, American Samoa, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.While many of these states are mainstays of Super Tuesday, what is notable is the inclusion of delegate-rich states Texas and California on the same election day. While most Super Tuesdays have about 20% of the potential delegates up for grabs, the inclusion of both these states at once rockets that number to be 30% ofDemocrat electorsand 36% of Republican electors available to be won.The inclusion of these two powerful states could be interpreted as a desire for both parties to avoid a drawn out primary and focus on defeating the opposition in November.NRAVoters in Michigan handed decisive victories to President Biden and former President Trump last week, increasing the odds of a2020 rematchas the candidates look to solidify their frontrunner positions on Super Tuesday.The Associated Press called Michigan for Biden and Trump shortly after polls closed last Tuesday, leaving both candidates undefeated in their bid to once again represent their respective parties in 2024'spresidential election.Biden's victory in the state came despite a late push among Arab Americans to ""abandon"" their support for the president over his continued support of Israel in the War in Gaza.A growing movement called on voters to cast an ""uncommitted"" ballot instead of continuing what has typically been overwhelming support for the president.The movement picked up the support of Rep.Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who announced her public opposition to supporting the president ahead of her home state's primary.""I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted. We must protect our democracy. We must make sure that our government is about us, about the people,"" Tlaib said in a video shared by Listen To Michigan, a group supportive of the uprising against Biden.Fox News' Michael Lee contributed to this report.Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty ImagesSuper Tuesdayis a day during the U.S. presidential primary election season when several states, typically from various regions across the country, hold their primary elections or caucuses in early March.New Hampshire and Iowa were the first states to hold contests in the 2024presidential electioncycle in January.Super Tuesday is considered a critical day in the primary process, as the outcomes of millions of voters can significantly influence the overall nomination for presidential candidates. This year’s Super Tuesday will be held on March 5 with polls closing around 7 or 8 p.m. Results will not be immediately announced for many states.On 2024's Super Tuesday, states participating in casting ballots include California, Colorado, Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.GOP candidate Nikki Hailey’s campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, wrote in a memo early Tuesday that “despite the media narrative, there is significant fertile ground for Nikki.”“After Super Tuesday, we will have a very good picture of where this race stands. At that point, millions of Americans in 26 states and territories will have voted,” the memo read.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has picked up several significant endorsements from key Republican senators. A growing number of GOP lawmakers urge Hailey to withdraw, advocating for party unity behind Trump before Super Tuesday.South Carolina Sen.Tim Scottand Lindsey Graham have endorsed Trump, snubbing Hailey, despite her being a former governor of the state from 2011-2017.Fox News' Jamie Joseph contributed to this report.Live Coverage begins here"

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/intel-report-says-putin-ordered-campaign-to-influence-us-election,Intel report says Putin ordered campaign to influence US election,A declassified U.S. intelligence report released Friday directly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – findings made public after officials briefed President-elect Donald Trump.,"January 6, 2017",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Reaction on 'The Five' to unclassified intelligence reportA declassified U.S. intelligence report released Friday directly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – findings made public after officials briefed President-elect Donald Trump.The report said:“We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”CLICK HERE TO READ THE REPORTThe intelligence report said this campaign included cyber activity and other efforts.The report adds fresh fuel to the debate over Russia’s involvement in email hacking that affected Democratic groups during the 2016 race. Trump has publicly questioned the evidence linking Russia and, hours before his briefing on Friday, called the focus a “political witch hunt.”However, Trump and the intelligence community seemed to find some common ground after the briefing. Both Trump and the report said the Russians did not target vote tallying.Trump, in a statement, went a step further and said “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.”The report did not make an assessment on the impact on the election outcome.While some have used the claims of Russian meddling to question the validity of Trump’s victory – including in a failed protest on the House floor during the certification of the Electoral College tally Friday – House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that “Donald Trump won this election fair and square.”Still, the report lays out in new and alarming detail an alleged influence campaign stemming from Moscow, which Ryan and others condemned.The report said that included cyber activity, as well as efforts by state-funded media and paid social media “trolls.” The report said Russian intelligence services conducted cyber operations against both major U.S. parties, and said they have “high confidence” Russian military intelligence used Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com to release “US victim data” publicly and to the media, “and relayed material to WikiLeaks.”WikiLeaks famously published emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta last year. Founder Julian Assange, however, told Fox News this past week that Russia was not his source.The intelligence report was declassified in the wake of Obama administration sanctions and other retaliation against the Russian government late last month. The unclassified version included footnotes acknowledging that it ""does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign."" But it said its conclusions were identical to the classified version.The report said Russian intelligence got access to DNC networks in July 2015 and maintained that access until at least June 2016. Despite past suggestions from Clinton allies that some leaked emails might be inauthentic, the report also noted that, “Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.”The report also said: “Moscow’s approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia’s understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.”In a statement issued shortly before the release of the report, Trump stressed his regard for the intelligence community: “I had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation.”But the allegations have been the subject of fierce debate in Washington, especially among Republicans.GOP lawmakers like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have essentially accepted the accusations against Russia, while Trump and his allies have cast doubt on them or suggested they were meant to discredit him.In his written statement, Trump acknowledged that Russia, China and others “are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee” – but said “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome.”Trump also said the U.S. needs to fight and stop cyberattacks, and he’ll appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office. “Two weeks from today I will take the oath of office and America’s safety and security will be my number one priority,” he said.Before the briefing, Trump continued to raise concerns about the intel being used for political purposes. He told The New York Times he doesn’t want other countries hacking the U.S., but said the attention on Russia’s alleged actions stems from those who “got beaten very badly in the election” and “are very embarrassed.”Following on complaints about how the intelligence findings have been portrayed in the media, he even tweeted that he’s asked congressional committee leaders to “investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.”In another twist, following reports that the FBI never accessed the Democratic National Committee’s servers as part of their probe, a senior FBI official told Fox News the bureau did in fact ask – and was denied.“The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,” the official said. “This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier.”Fox News’ Catherine Herridge and Matthew Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-biden-election-supreme-court-john-yoo,John Yoo: Trump-Biden presidential race could be decided by Pennsylvania case before Supreme Court,The Supreme Court could determine who is elected president if it takes up a court case from Pennsylvania involving mail-in ballots.,"November 6, 2020",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"<br>With the presidential election still undecided,President Trump’scampaign has launched a flurry of lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. The suits raise a range of claims. These include the exclusion of observers from vote-counting rooms, voting by non-residents, and even the counting of votes listed as being cast by people who have died.But the case that could decide it all started weeks ago, and is currently waiting at the U.S.Supreme Court. The Boockvar case involves a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court regarding how late mail-in ballots can be counted in that state.If the Supreme Court takes up this case and the presidential election hinges on the result of the vote in Pennsylvania, the high court could determine who is elected president.TRUMP CAMPAIGN PREDICTS VICTORY AS EARLY AS FRIDAY: 'DONALD TRUMP IS ALIVE AND WELL'The U.S. Constitution does not establish a system that uses the courts to pick the president. The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College — an institution that survives to this day — to pick select our nation’s leader.In the Electoral College, each state receives as many votes as it has members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. California, our most populous state, gets 55 electoral votes — more than any other state. Our least-populated states each get 3 electoral votes.The founders rejected direct election of the president by the populace as a whole. They feared demagogues who might flatter and bewitch the people would get elected. But they also did not want Congress to choose the president. The founders believed that the president must remain independent so he could stand up to Congress and not be beholden to lawmakers to stay in office.State legislatures were given the power under the Constitution to choose members of the Electoral College. However, legislatures have delegated that power to voters. So when you cast your ballot in presidential elections you are not actually voting directly for a candidate. You are voting for electors pledged to vote for that candidate.This system represents a compromise that blended a popular voice with the institution of the states to elect the president — while avoiding Congress altogether. In most states, the legislature has decided that whichever candidate gets the most popular votes gets all the state’s electoral votes.The Constitution also gave state legislatures the exclusive authority to regulate the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.” While Congress can overrule the choices of the state legislatures, state courts cannot. This is a crucial point. State legislatures set the deadlines, define the validity of ballots, and the manner of counting the votes.This system can handle any normal election. But the election this week was no normal election. The COVID-19 pandemic forced some states to adopt large-scale mail-in balloting for the first time. Pennsylvania, for example, had 266,000 mail-in ballots in 2016, but 2.5 million this year. Most states have never mounted such a massive mail-in and counting effort before.Further, America simply cannot make up its mind. Aside from Barack Obama’s two elections, the presidential elections from 2000 on have been so razor-thin that the Electoral College has made all the difference.If President Trump is reelected, he will have won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote for two elections in a row. Gone are the days when television networks and other news organizations could call the presidential election in the early evening because of the projected popular vote alone.In this context, the litigation in Pennsylvania could make all the difference if that state’s 20 electoral votes are needed to determine whether President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election.As I write this, Trump and Biden are within a single point of each other in the popular vote in Pennsylvania. The candidate winning the state’s 20 electoral votes remains undetermined.The mail-in ballots received between Tuesday and Friday this week in Pennsylvania and accepted under the order of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could decide the winner of the presidential race in that state, even if the winner prevails by a very small number of popular votes. This is not unprecedented. In 2000, George W. Bush won Florida, the state’s electoral votes and the presidency by about 500 votes.It is at this point that Trump has a strong case pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. His campaign and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania can challenge the vote in the state on the grounds that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unconstitutionally interfered with the state legislature’s sole authority over the time, place, and manner of federal elections and over the selection of presidential electors.If the U.S. Constitution directly grants those powers to the legislature of Pennsylvania, state courts have no authority to alter state election law for federal office, including the presidency. As a result, the U.S. Supreme Court could strike down the extension of the Pennsylvania deadline to accept ballots until Friday and order the state to reject any ballots that arrived after Election Day on Tuesday.This is not some constitutional flight of fancy. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has already made clear his view that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has violated the U.S. Constitution by allowing mail-in ballots to be accepted until Friday.In an opinion urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accelerate its consideration of the issues raised in the Boockvar case, Alito wrote: “The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has issued a decree that squarely alters an important statutory provision enacted by the Pennsylvania Legislature pursuant to its authority under the Constitution of the United States to make rules governing the conduct of elections for federal office.”Joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Alito concluded: “That question has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution.”  In a separate case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh adopted the same view.Some critics will argue that the U.S. Supreme Court should defer to state courts in the interpretation of state law. Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted to delay the Boockvar case at the U.S. Supreme Court until after the election, admitted as much in a similar case from Wisconsin, where he agreed to overturn a federal judge’s order to extend the Election Day deadline.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERRoberts remains sensitive to political attacks on the U.S. Supreme Court. He probably fears a rerun of Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court stopped recounts in Florida 2000 and sealed George Bush’s victory over Vice President Al Gore in the presidential election that year. Democrats and liberals have attacked the political legitimacy of the Supreme Court ever since.Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, however, could upend Roberts’ carefully laid plans. Barrett had not yet joined the court when Roberts prevented the court from accelerating consideration of Boockvar. The case still remains on the Supreme Court docket, neither rejected nor accepted for review.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf Barrett joins the other four conservative justices, who share her originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, then Roberts could not stop the Supreme Court from intervening in Pennsylvania or from deciding in favor of invalidating all mail-in ballots that came in after Election Day.President Trump, who came from the world of reality TV to the unreal world of politics, will then be hoping that Pennsylvania 2020 turns out to be a rerun of Florida 2000, allowing him to serve a second term.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JOHN YOOJohn Yoo, co-author ofThe Politically Incorrect Guide to the Supreme Court, is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

That’s down slightly from 7.8 points a month ago.The Real Clear Politics average of national polling on this date four years ago showed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by 3 points. Clinton led Trump by 3.2 points on the eve of the general election – and ended up winning the national popular vote by 2%.But the race for the White House isn’t a fight for the national popular vote. Trump narrowly topped Clinton in many of the key battleground states, which helped him trounce her in the all-important Electoral College count to win the White House.President Donald Trump wraps up his speech at a campaign rally at Fayetteville Regional Airport, Saturday, Sept. 19, 2020, in Fayetteville, N.C.

""And by the way, this also led to a prediction ofDonald Trump'swin, which made me virtually alone in making that prediction in 2016.""Lichtman says the Democrats represented by Harris could lose five keys ""at most"" and that is why he is predicting that ""we are going to have a precedent-breaking election and Kamala Harris will become the first woman President of the United States.""WHO HAS THE ‘KEYS TO THE WHITE HOUSE’?

Days earlier, Confederate Gen. John Brown Gordon, considered one of the South’s most audacious, scaled a mountain near General Sheridan’s Union Army and spotted a glaring weakness in the Federal lines: they had exposed their left flank.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1862, ABRAHAM LINCOLN PROCLAIMS SLAVES WILL SOON BE 'FOREVER FREE'The Federals encamped in the Shenandoah Valley had falsely assumed that Massanutten Mountain would be too rugged for any force to surmount and attack the Union line undetected.

The book reveals the drama of irregular guerrilla warfare that altered the course of the Civil War, including the story of Lincoln’s special forces who donned Confederate gray to hunt Mosby and his Confederate Rangers from 1863 to the war’s end at Appomattox. These soldiers inspired the creation ofU.S. special operationsin World War II.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, NOVEMBER 19, 1863, PRESIDENT LINCOLN DELIVERS THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESSThe frigid autumn fog of Oct. 19 screened thousands of wraithlike Confederates as they let out the Rebel Yell and descended on the slumbering Union VIII Corps around 5 a.m. Utter pandemonium gripped many Union regiments and brigades as they disintegrated and fled northward to Middletown. Union soldiers were bayoneted while slumbering in their tents. Hordes of gray swept through the quickly disintegrating Federal lines.Hungry, shoeless Confederates attacked not only the Federals but their rations.

The group said Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when some of his supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, violated a clause in the 14th Amendment that prevents officers of the United States, members of Congress or state legislatures who ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against theConstitution from holding political office.The Colorado case ultimately made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously sided with Trump that he should remain on the state's ballot. The ruling affected all states across the nation that worked to remove Trump’s name, requiring them to include him on primary ballots as well.SUPREME COURT RULES UNANIMOUSLY FOR TRUMP IN COLORADO BALLOT DISQUALIFICATION DISPUTEThe tactic was slammed by Republicans and conservatives as a ""constitutional violation,"" while even former Obama adviser David Axelrod warned on CNN that removing Trump’s name would be seen as ""a subversion"" of democracy.Fox News Digital spoke to Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray when the SCOTUS decision was released, who called the Democrat tactic ""lunacy."" Gray had been battling Democrats' argument that Trump was ineligible to appear on the primary ballots over Jan. 6 for months ahead of the Supreme Court decision.""I think one of the lessons of this is … the way the radical left despises the American people and our process, and what happens then is lunacy. And that's what their whole argumentation and what they were trying to do was. It was pure lunacy,"" Gray told Fox Digital in March.""We're going to continue to monitor the processes across our nation and be vigilant. Any time the people are able to choose for themselves, that's a win for our republic, and that's what our elections are about. And I'm going to continue to unapologetically fight for thepeople of Wyomingand the people across our country to choose who to elect for themselves,"" Gray added at the time.FAILED EFFORT TO BOOT TRUMP FROM BALLOT EXPOSES 'RADICAL' LEFT'S ‘PURE LUNACY’: STATE ELECTION CHIEFThe U.S. Supreme Court(Robert Alexander/Getty Images)The Biden-Harris administration in July rolled out aslate of policiesto overhaul the Supreme Court. The proposal includes calls for term limits for Supreme Court justices, an enforceable ethics code for justices and an amendment to the Constitution to overturn the high court's ruling that former presidents have substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts while in office.Critics slammed the proposal as an attempt to pack the court, including attorney Mark Paoletta, who worked for the Trump administration. He argued that, including the term limit proposal,Biden and Harris' plan outlineda system in which the president appoints a new Supreme Court justice ""every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court.""""Even though Joe Biden caved to radicals and recently endorsed court packing, Harris is even further to the left of him on this thoroughly discredited idea,"" Paoletta said in a statement to Fox News Digital in August.Conservative activist Leonard Leo also argued to Fox Digital that the proposal would likely serve as a prelude to court packing if Harris is elected next month.LEONARD LEO WARNS BIDEN-HARRIS EFFORTS TO RADICALLY OVERHAUL SUPREME COURT COULD 'BACKFIRE'""If Kamala Harris is elected president, andif the Senate isin Democrat hands, I think that there is some risk of court packing. I think that there is some risk of continued, scurrilous attacks on the integrity of the court, all based on a disagreement over the outcomes of various decisions that Democrats don't like,"" he said. ""And that would really be most unfortunate.""Democrats have pushed to broaden the court in an effort to switch it from a conservative majority. Biden, however, had previously called court packing a ""bonehead idea"" in 1983 while serving as a U.S. senator from Delaware, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it ""anti-democratic"" in 2021.MSNBC PANEL BLASTS BIDEN FROM THE LEFT FOR NOT PACKING THE SUPREME COURT: ‘HISTORIC POLITICAL MISCALCULATION’(Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Harris called for the end of the filibuster last month in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide, which was slammed by lawmakers and conservatives as an attack on democracy.""Shame on her,"" independent Sen. Joe Manchin said at the Capitol last month. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It’s the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the house on steroids.""HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAWThe filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.Harris said late last month she would like to end the filibuster to pass a law protecting access to abortion.""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said during a WPR interview. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""Democrat-turned-independentSen. KyrstenSinemaalso panned the proposal, calling it a ""terrible, shortsighted idea.""""To state the supremely obvious, eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide,"" Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022,wrote on X. ""What an absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea.""KAMALA HARRIS ISN’T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONEImmigrants line up at a remote U.S. Border Patrol processing center after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on Dec. 7, 2023, in Lukeville, Ariz.(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Illegal immigration via the nation's southern border grew to crisis levels under the Biden administration, with at least 7 million migrants coming into the nation in the last three and a half years.Illegal immigrants are not able to vote in federal elections, but conservative lawmakers and pundits have warned that upcoming elections could be affected by the flux of migrants.SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILL WITHOUT SAVE ACT, AVOIDING POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN""If you have a small percentage of the millions and billions (sic) of illegals who came over the border in the last four years under border czar Kamala Harris' policies, they can throw an election, they can throw the majority of the House,""Speaker of the House Mike Johnsonsaid last month.Republicans in Congress introduced legislation this year, the SAVE Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Lawmakers who promoted the legislation cited that it would ""preserve our democracy.""""There's nothing more sacred and more profound than the right to vote and especially to preserve our self-governing constitutional republic and to preserve our democracy.

Tim Walz(Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, advocated for the end of the Electoral College during a campaign event this week – a call conservatives have previously panned.""I think all of us know the Electoral College needs to go,"" he said, according to a pool report at the event, Bloomberg reported. ""We need a national popular vote, but that's not the world we live in.""The campaign subsequently walked Walz’s comment back shortly after.TIM WALZ CALLS FOR ELIMINATION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE AT CALIFORNIA FUNDRAISER, SAYS 'IT NEEDS TO GO'""Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College and he is honored to be traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket,"" a Harris campaign spokesperson told USA Today. ""He was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes. And, he was thanking them for their support that is helping fund those efforts.""Liberals have increasingly called for the end of the Electoral College, which is the formal process of electing the president and vice president, in favor of the popular vote. The Electoral College consists of a certain number of electors from each state who cast votes for the president and vice president, then whichever candidate receives the most ballots is awarded the electoral votes for that state.Since 1992, Democrats have won seven of the eight popular votes, including failed 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton and failed 2000 candidate Al Gore, who lost the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.Conservatives have slammed efforts and calls to end the Electoral College, including the Heritage Foundation’s Hans Von Spakovsky, who argued that getting rid of the process would not produce a more democratic election.""The U.S. should maintain the Electoral College, which has successfully elected Presidents throughout this nation’s history in a way that best represents the diverse and various interests of America,"" Von Spakovsky wrote in a piece after the 2020 election.""In an age of perceived political dysfunction, effective policies that are already in place – especially successful policies established by this nation’s Founders, such as theElectoral College – should be preserved.""In 2012,Trump also panned the electoral system, calling it ""a disaster for a democracy."" In 2018, he again voiced support for the idea because a popular vote would be ""much easier to win.""However, more recently, the Trump campaign has since slammed Walz for his comments calling for the abolition of the Electoral College, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt saying this week that the process is ""a critical component of our Constitution.""Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Harris(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)Harrisascended to the top of the Democrat ticket without facing a primary after President Biden dropped out of the race this past summer as concerns mounted over his mental acuity and age.Biden endorsed Harris for the Oval Office shortly after dropping out of race via a social media post on X, with the Democratic Party subsequently quickly coalescing around the VP.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/overseas-voters-us-presidential-ballots-counted-pandemic-postal-problems,"From pandemic to postal problems, overseas voters worry their US presidential ballots won't get counted","Plagued by a global pandemic, postal stoppages, state law changes, and confusion – many of the 9 million U.S. citizens eligible to vote from outside the country worry they won’t get their say in the 2020 Presidential election.","October 23, 2020",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Three critical swing states are facing another mail-in ballot challenge. In Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin workers are not allowed to prepare and scan ballots before Election Day - a process called pre-canvassing.Plagued by a global pandemic, postal stoppages, state law changes, and confusion – many of the 9 million U.S. citizens eligible to vote from outside the country worry they won’t get their say in the2020 presidentialelection.“This has been a challenging election,” Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and CEO of the nonprofitU.S. Vote Foundation and Overseas Vote, which endeavors to help Americans abroad, told Fox News. “As more issues regarding changes in the United States Postal Service [USPS] processes and evidence of slowdowns and international suspensions in service emerged, concern and outright anxiety embraced the overseas voting populace.”According to Dzieduszycka-Suinat, the deluge of worry from voters has centered on their ability to cast a timely ballot.“The [questions] started coming in a steady stream earlier this year as the voters realized their usual letters and packages to and from the U.S. were not being delivered in a timely manner,” she continued. “It was obvious to Americans living abroad that something had gone very wrong.”Compounding the concerns and confusion is the notion that in some parts of the world, mail has halted altogether. USPS has curbed international mail services in at least38 countriesas a result of “Foreign Postal Operator Service Suspension,” “Unavailability of Transportation,” or “Suspension of Global Express Guaranteed Service.”USPS also lists hundreds of “disruption information” memos regarding services from dozens of other countries – from Australia to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mexico to Thailand – throughout the course of the year.Recent notices include the government extension curfew until Nov. 1 in Jamaica, where it is “affecting the quality of service for all types of mail, including inbound and outbound letters, parcels and express mail service items,” or Panama’s post advisory last month “that the suspension of inbound and outbound international flights has been extended until mid-October and airlines are not transporting international mail dispatches until further notice. Transit services also continue to be suspended.”Deepening the anxieties of thoseoverseasare the question marks of whether their ballots will make it home in time amid the slowness and sputtering of mail due to the coronavirus pandemic.In Hong Kong – a city more than 85,000 Americans call home – a postal operator in August announced that snail mail home could take upwards of three months. Adding to the already tight timing, registering to vote in some states – such as New York – mandates the additional step of signing and mailing the paperwork, and they do not accept electronic signatures. For some, that made the Oct. 9 registration deadline all but impossible.DNI RATCLIFFE, FBI SAY IRAN, RUSSIA ATTEMPTING TO INTERFERE WITH 2020 ELECTIONAnd in Europe, there have been differing layers of confusion, country to country and then home state to state. Some wereinformedfrom tracking services that their packages could take weeks to arrive; others lamented that they were turned away at the embassy and perplexed as to why.However, USPS officials remain confident that the organization is up for the task.“With a record number of people across the country voting by mail, the U.S. Postal Service’s No. 1 priority between now and the November election is the secure, timely delivery of the nation’s Election Mail,” a spokesperson for USPS told Fox News. “The Postal Service is fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when public policymakers choose to utilize us as a part of their election system, and to delivering Election mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.""A voter drops their ballot off during early voting, Monday, Oct. 19, 2020, in Athens, Ga. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)USPS stressed that voters covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) – a 1986 law requiring that the states and territories allow certain groups of citizens to register and vote absentee in elections for federal offices – “should monitor possible service disruptions to foreign countries, including service disruptions due to COVID-19.”But since UOCAVA’s enactment more than three decades ago, it has been subject to hundreds of lawsuits claiming issues of accessibility.Other Americans abroad have taken to Twitter to express their grievances over navigating a process they had previously done numerous times. Some bemoaned incorrect URLs and mailing addresses issued on their absentee forms, promptinglocal commissionsto take action. Postal sluggishness stateside has also multiplied woes over whether one’s submission will slip through the cracks in a timely enough fashion.Compounding the hurdles amid the COVID era are the various curfews and economic closures in different countries, often on an arbitrary basis. Sometimes it is big things like no mail or no ability to take transport to the nearest embassy or consulate, to seemingly smaller but vital things like the closure of printing stores. In some situations, even dropping off a ballot at the nearest embassy or consulate is no longer an option given temporary coronavirus closures.“The pandemic affected the U.S. embassy and consulate network, limiting even essential services,” Dzieduszycka-Suinat underscored. “That meant that not only was voting assistance and the option to return ballots through the diplomatic post affected, so were other services, such as acquiring social security numbers, passports and visas.”David Beirne, Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) director, concurred that U.S. citizen voters might have faced temporary lockdowns ordisruptionsto regular mail services due to the pandemic.“Any barriers experienced by a UOCAVA voter vary depending on their location, access to resources, training opportunities, and the availability of voter assistance. Voters have expressed concerns over returning their voted ballot by mail due to local country COVID-19 restrictions.,” he said.Under federal law, any U.S. citizen residing abroad has the right to vote by absentee ballot for the president, vice president and congressional representative. To do so, they must first be registered to vote in their last state of residence, even if they may no longer have ties to an address there.Reading, PA - September 28: A detail photo of the section of the ballot with the selections for President.

Those who were born in a foreign land, but are U.S. citizens, also have that constitutional right – but some states such as New York still require an individual to first travel to the U.S. and establish a residence in order to register.The majority of states allowonlineregistration, but several — including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — mandate mail-in ballots only. There are others that permit email or faxed ballots.Moreover, some citizens can cast a vote at a diplomatic dwelling, but around half the states do not permit that. Some states will not accept ballots that arrive after the polls close on Nov. 3, whereas others have set time periods of admission after Election Day, providing the envelope is postmarked by Election Day.U.S. military personnel and their families stationed overseas also have their own voting process, with different advised mailing dates, and it is handled on a federal level.“Overseas military mail continues to move regardless of international postal disruptions. Overseas military and other citizens with military post office access can drop off their voted ballots free of charge if they use the postage-paid envelope template available on fvap.gov,” Beirne explained.Evette Kessler, a military spouse in Grafenwoehr, Germany, and a Nevada residence, said in her experience, 2020 was relatively smooth sailing.“We received our absentee ballots, filled them out, and sent them off,” she said. “From what I see over here, most of the people I know have cast their absentee ballot votes. Everyone wants to be heard in the most important election in our lifetime. The biggest worry so far has been the possibility of our ballots being thrown away by mail carriers.”FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP GAINS IN OHIO, BIDEN AHEAD IN MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSINThe unique challenges of 2020 for most could make voting this time around all the more cost-prohibitive for some.In the midst of concerns surrounding the timing and the mail service, courier companies such as FedEx announced in late summer that they would offer discounts on next-day deliveries from several European nations – but even that begins at around $30. The likes of Dzieduszycka-Suinat have contended that courier costs are still too high to be considered fair or reasonable.Historically, voter turnout by those outside the U.S. has been meager – but it remains to be seen if the bumps of 2020 will drive more citizens from jumping through the hoops or if the fraught and polarizing nature of this cycle, in particular, will compel more to go the extra mile.Harris County election worker Jose Vasquez prepares mail-in ballots to be sent to voters Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020, in Houston. To be allowed to vote by absentee ballot in Texas, voters must be 65 or older; have a disability; or be outside the county where you're registered to vote on Election Day and during early voting.

But in the 2016 election, just 7% voted, a sharp contrast to the 60.2% who took to the polls on U.S. turf. Yet it may well be that small slice that makes all the difference between aDonald TrumporJoe BidenWhite House.The current traffic to FVAP.gov for the 2020 calendar year is approximately twice the level of 2016, Beirne said, adding, “This does not necessarily correspond to an increased level of interest.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDzieduszycka-Suinat noted that compared to 2016, they are seeing a 150% increase in website traffic for voter help from countries outside the U.S., which she views as an “excellent indication of greater participation.”“Without question, the greatest concerns have been around the postal system and what it means for ballot receipt and return. When a core component of our country’s basic commercial and international operations is suddenly in a state of dysfunction, it implies that something may not be quite right at home,” she added. “It is an irony, but living abroad often brings Americans closer to their home country through their broadened awareness of our country’s impact on the world.”Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

You have to go back to then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in 2000.But in the wake of two recent polls that indicated a margin-of-error race in New Hampshire and following President Biden's extremely rough debate performance two weeks ago, Republicans are increasingly hopeful they can bring an end to the losing streak.""It’s going to be a coin toss. It’s really at the end of the day going to be a 50-50 state,"" Sununu said in a national exclusive interview withFox News Digitalin his hometown in New Hampshire's Seacoast region.Sununu predicted that Trump ""is going to do very, very well in a swing state like New Hampshire.""Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.Getty ImagesPresident Joe Biden still has time to turn his campaign around and evade being replaced as the nominee despite a damaging two weeks that followed the first presidential debate, Democrat strategiststell Fox News Digital.Biden faces increased calls to step down as the Democratic nominee following his performance at the first presidential debate, however strategists with knowledge of presidential campaigns say irreversible damage has not been done to his re-election efforts.""The president has been clear — he’s the elected nominee, and he is not budging from that position unless god himself intervenes,"" Democrat strategist Mark Penn told Fox News Digital when asked about the state of Biden's campaign.""Right now, Donald Trump is clearly leading, but it’s nowhere near double digits, so the race remains within the ability of a few percent of switching voters to change the outcome and, as events like the debate show, there’s plenty of game-changing possibilities.""Penn added that ""net-net Biden is now the underdog, but this race is far from over.""Jessica Tarlov, Fox News Contributor and Democrat political strategist, also said that Biden has more than enough time to turn his campaign around before November.""Is there enough time? Of course. Four months is a lifetime in politics. The election is about Trump. Those that will support him and those that won’t.

(Pete Souza/AFP via Getty Images)Criticism fromex-Obama stafferstoward President Biden, including calls for him to exit the 2024 presidential race, serve as a stark reminder of the well-known tensions between the former White House duo that go back nearly two decades.The often testy relationship between Biden and Obama reportedly began shortly after the latter's election to the Senate in 2004, when both men served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Obama, according to The New York Times, wasn't fond of Biden's often-long-winded speeches to the point where, on one occasion, he passed a note to a colleague reading, ""Shoot. Me. Now.""The pair eventually found themselves facing off for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, where Biden, while announcing his campaign, controversially referred to Obama as ""the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.""The intense repercussions from the comment led to an apology from Biden, and Obama telling reporters, ""I have no problem with Joe Biden.""Biden eventually dropped out of the race after a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, but was subsequently picked by Obama to be his running mate. The two ultimately defeated Republican nominees John McCain and Sarah Palin.The first few months of their administration reportedly saw frequent disagreements between the two, including a clash over Obama publicly diminishing Biden while speaking to reporters — which he later agreed with an upset Biden to avoid doing — and eye rolls from the former while the latter spoke during meetings.Fox News Digital's Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report.The Biden campaign is taking avictory lapafter his NATO press conference on Thursday, claiming the president not only met expectations but exceeded them.A Biden campaign official told Fox News Digital that his performance was what voters were looking for, while praising the president's responses to questions on foreign policy, including the Russia-Ukraine War, China and other foreign affairs topics.The performance proved that Biden can handle former President Trump, the campaign believes.Biden, according to the campaign, articulately laid out the economic progress under his watch and discussed complex foreign policy issues in a way that Trump is unable to do.He was also hit with questions from reporters who pressed him on whether he would step aside amid mounting pressure from members within his own party following his disastrous debate performance last month.Fox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.President Biden's solopress conferenceThursday evening at the NATO summit attracted an estimated 24.2 million people, according to Nielsen data.The conference was available on eight television networks, including Fox News, all of which carried the press conference live from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. ETIt came after the NATO Summit in Washington and as questions about Biden mental and physical acuity continue to hound him.The largest viewership was in the 55 and older demographic, where 19.2 million viewers watched live. Among adults 18-34, the number was just over 1 million, while 3.6 million adults ages 35 to 54 tuned in.In comparison, Biden’s debate against former President Donald Trump in June drew over 51.3 million total viewers across all broadcast and cable networks.U.S. Rep.Brad Schneider, D-Il., said he called on President Biden to make the ""heroic choice"" and exit the presidential race to ""pass the baton to the next generation.""Speaking with ""Your World"" host Neil Cavuto on Friday, Schneider, said a new generation of leaders are ready to move the country forward.""And in the Democratic Party, we have a lot of leaders ready to take the mantle and move us forward,"" he said. ""I think the president has a chance to unite the party, unite the country.""Schneider is one of more than a dozen Democrats calling for Biden to quit his bid for a second term as question swirl over his mental and physical acuity.""I was the first of the Illinois delegation four years ago to endorse Joe Biden,"" he said. ""I thought he would be a great president, and he proved me right.""Schneider added that Biden press conference on Thursday didn't convince him to stand by the president.""it's not about a single press conference or a debate or a campaign event. It's about where are we going and who's best positioned to lead us,"" he said. ""The president's done a great job bringing us to where we are. I think he has a chance.""""But a capstone on his legacy, a legacy that he could be proud of and I believe will leave him as one of the greatest presidents in our nation's history,"" he added. ""But it's time for the next generation to step up, and we have the leaders to decide.""President Biden continues to havesupport from Democratic delegates, despite a growing number of elected Democrats calling on him to step aside ahead of the 2024 election amid concern over his age and mental acuity.Fox News Digital spoke to a handful of Democratic delegates who remain largely supportive of Biden and intend to cast their votes in support of him at the party's convention next month.Some also dismissed talk of Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden's replacement, insisting that she and the president are an unbreakable team.""I think he did an awesome job last night. I really do,"" said Joanne Chesley, a pledged Biden delegate from North Carolina. ""His clarity and his spontaneity … just well-informed responses. I was super impressed.""S did say that she wishedthat Bidenhad realized that his age was going to be a potential issue in this election much earlier.""I have gone from that kind of feeling, wishing that he had, you know, made that decision to say ‘no' [to] we've got a person who really, really cares about this country,"" she said. ""Despite those occasional flirtations with him stepping aside, I, like I said, come back to looking at what's best for our country right now. We're in a very difficult time in our history.""Fox News Digital's Kyle Morris contributed to this report.President Joe Biden (L) and former U.S. President Barack Obama (R) embrace on stage during a rally.

(Bill Clark/Roll Call/Getty Images)A former Democratic lawmaker who led a failed effort to unseat President Jimmy Carter at the party's 1980 convention said he expects that President Biden will likely be ousted before next month’s DNC in Chicago.Former Rep. Mike Barnes, D-Md., told theNew York PostBiden could be out in a matter of days.“I don’t think this is going to go to the Democratic convention in the current posture,” he told The Post in an interview Friday. “I think, I think, Biden will be out probably within the next days.”The 1980 Democratic convention, held at New York's Madison Square Garden, saw Carter stave off a challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.Biden has resisted calls to exit the presidential race following his debate performance heavily-criticized debate performance last month and has insisted that he will be the Democratic nominee.“I think if he goes to the convention wanting the nomination, and all of his troops are working the delegates, he’ll be nominated,” Barnes said.Delegates are expected to nominate Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in a virtual roll call sometime before the Aug. 7 deadline to make the Ohio ballot.Barnes said that concerns about Biden’s age were well-founded.“I’m 80 years old. I’m in pretty decent shape. I swam a mile yesterday. I played golf the day before, and I’m planning to go to the gym later today for an hour and a half.“But it would be crazy for me to think about running for President of the United States and being president from now until January 20, 2029,” he added. “Yeah. I mean, this is, this is crazy.”The Biden campaign received a jump in donations following the president's Thursday night press conference at a NATO Summit.""Since last night, we're seeing strong support across our coalition. But most importantly, we're seeing with our grassroots base,"" Campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler said. ""We have close to 40,000 donations last night alone. Donations exploded during the president's press conference. In fact, we had seven times, our average during the press conference.""Tyler didn't say how much in campaign contributions was received but the outpouring comes amid concerns that Biden fundraising pool is quickly drying up.Major donors have decided to withhold contributions until Biden drops out of the race.""This is a massive, massive problem,"" one Democratic official told Politico. ""Right now, we should be scaling up, doubling and tripling our goals as we head into the fall. But we’re cratering.""The sources said grassroots fundraising is also being impacted by Biden's disastrous debate performance against former President Trump.Fox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.First lady Jill Biden’s former press secretaryblasted the White Housecommunications team, saying they live in an ""alternate universe"" after a senior official praised President Biden's performance durign a Thursday NATO press conference.""There are two different versions of reality in my party right now, Michael LaRosa, who served as first lady Jill Biden's press secretary, wrote on X in response to a post from Republican communicator Sarah Matthews criticizing the White House's Senior Deputy Press Secretary, Andrew Bates.""The below is an alternate universe that MOST of us Dems are NOT actually living in,"" he wrote. ""Being coherent in his FIRST ‘big boy press conference’ of 2024 is not exactly the bar most of us are looking for.... but clearly it's the bar for Biden set by his own staff ... and that is pretty ‘f---ing’ terrifying.""Matthews had criticized Bates for a post on X he made following Biden’s highly anticipatedNATO press conferencewhere the senior staffer said, ""To answer the question on everyone’s minds: No, Joe Biden does not have a doctorate in foreign affairs.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cuban-regimes-meddling-us-elections-badge-honor-targeted-critics,Cuban regime’s reported return to meddling in US elections a ‘badge of honor’ for targeted critics,"Rep. Carlos Gimenez said he wears the Cuba regime's derision of him like a 'badge of honor,' after reports surfaced the regime is again trying to interfere in elections.",July 30,2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., tells Fox News Digital he's 70 years old and could run around 'that roof all day.'With a presidential election drawing near, 90 miles off the U.S. mainland, the Communist Cuban government is reportedly attempting to once again influence down ballot races as it did two years ago.One such target-rich area is reportedly South Florida, where a large majority of Cuban émigrés and Cuban-Americans now live after their families escaped the regime long controlled by the Castro brothers.In a Monday briefing with reporters, an ODNI official confirmed the Cuban government is attempting to counter American candidates opposed to the communist regime, according to theMiami Herald.During the 2022 election, the intelligence community discovered Cuba had attempted to ""denigrat[e]"" certain candidates there. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba and represents the Florida Keys and part of Miami-Dade, said at the time he believed he was one such target.LAWMAKERS TORCH FEDS' CUBA REGULATION ADJUSTMENT AS ‘LIFELINE TO GREATEST ENEMY IN OUR HEMISPHERE’The now-deceased Fidel Castro meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both men's nations have been accused of interfering in U.S. elections.(AP Photo/Alex Castro)Other lawmakers suspected of being targets of Cuban interference at the time included fellow Miamians Mario Diaz-Balart and Maria Elvira Salazar — both Republicans.A source told Fox News Digital that one avenue the Cubans have used to target such lawmakers is to utilize social media so-called ""bots"" that attack Republicans from the political right, to make them unpalatable to the greater electorate.Salazar said Tuesday she is the ""No. 1 enemy… in Congress"" of Miguel Diaz-Canel’s regime in Havana.""[I]t is no surprise to me that they are trying to subvert our elections,"" said Salazar, who notablyrepresents ""Little Havana,""just west of downtown Miami.""Our American democracy is stronger than these weak attempts to silence their critics. We will be watching in 2024.""TOP REPUBLICAN, 70, CALLS CHEATLE'S SLOPED ROOF DEFENSE ‘THE FINAL STRAW’Cuban President Miguel Diaz Canel (R) and his Mexican counterpart Andrés Manuel López Obrador raise their hands before signing bilateral agreements.(YAMIL LAGE/AFP via Getty Images)Gimenez added Tuesday that he wears ""like a badge of honor"" the target Cuba has reportedly placed on him.The former Miami-Dade County mayor quipped that his goal is to remain in Congress longer than the regime remains in El Capitolio Nacional. Diaz-Canel is the first non-Castro to rule the island since Fulgencio Batista was overthrown in 1959.""I would expect myself, Maria and Mario would be their main targets again — along with Sen. Rick Scott,"" Gimenez said in the interview.""I guess it’s something that we live with here in South Florida: the fact that theCuban regimethinks that we are their enemies.""""We are their enemies. We want freedom for the Cuban people. And we won't stop until we get freedom for the Cuban people. So, take your best shot, what can I say?""When asked whether Congress can or should act against Cuba’s efforts, Gimenez was hesitant.""I'm not sure what Congress can do about it,"" he said, adding that if they were to do anything it would very likely fall in the censorship or ""fact-checking"" realm.He said he opposes censorship and has concerns that fact-checkers ""fact-check"" based inherently on their own ideological bend — suggesting such action would do more harm than good.""The responsibility really lies with the people and to determine what they're reading is true or false,"" he said. ""So, I'm not concerned about it that much.""At the other end of the Tamiami Trail, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., also condemnedCuba’s behavior.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel is the first non-Castro to hold power since the 1959 revolution.(AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)""The Communist Cuban regime is an oppressive dictatorship that has inflicted unimaginable horrors on the Cuban people,"" the Naples lawmaker said.""In South Florida, we stand for freedom. In South Florida, we stand for human rights. And in South Florida, we will never surrender to the evils of communism,"" he said.Donalds said such election interference from across the Florida Straits should never be tolerated.Fox News Digital reached out to the ODNI for comment, and wasprovided a copyof the agency’s report on foreign election ""threats"" during the 2022 cycle — wherein Cuba was cataloged beside Iran, China and Russia.Much of the report was redacted, but in unredacted pieces of the Cuba section, the agency assessed that Havana tried to undermine ""electoral prospects of specific U.S. congressional and gubernatorial politicians it perceived as hostile.""The report indicated that political parties across the board, including Republicans and Democrats, were the focal points of attention. It further highlighted that South Florida's heightened interest in the island nation made it a particularly susceptible hotspot for influence.Another angle the Cuban government has sought to influence American voters has been through the media. According to the report, they have sought to build relationships with journalists who share their opposing views of Congress’ Cuba critics.Gimenez said that sounded like a good strategy for the malign regime, while quipping, ""The fact they can find useful idiots in the American media — that’s a problem for the useful idiots.""Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.Charles coversmedia,politicsand culture for Fox News Digital.Charles is a Pennsylvania native and graduated from Temple University with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swing-states-poll-results-us-election-day-focus,"No clear winner in presidential race as vote counting continues, election hangs in balance",Americans went to bed Tuesday night and woke up Wednesday morning not sure who their next president will be as slow returns in key swing states delayed results and making it impossible to call the race for either President Trump or Joe Biden.,"November 3, 2020",2024-10-15,US Presidential Elections,Fox News,USA,"Americans went to bed Tuesday night and woke up Wednesday morning not sure who theirnext presidentwill be as slow returns in key swing states delayed results and making it impossible to call the race for eitherPresident TrumporJoe Biden.With the outcome still up in the air, both candidates claimed they had a path to victory -- with Biden urging patience and Trump essentially declaring victory in comments made after 2 a.m. ET.""We believe we are on track to win this election,"" Biden said in an early morning speech in Delaware.Trump declared victory in multiple key battleground states early Wednesday, even though it remained unclear who had the votes to win and hinted the White House would push the Supreme Court to rule over disputed ballots.“We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,” Trump said.The president was immediately contradicted by Vice President Mike Pence, who did not declare victory but rather said, ""I really believe with all my heart ... that we are on the road to victory and we will make America great again, again.""Biden, on the other hand, told supporters at a drive-in rally: ""Your patience is commendable. We knew this was gonna go long ... maybe tomorrow morning, maybe even longer.""""I'm optimistic about this outcome,"" the former vice president continued. ""Your patience is great.""The competing comments came as each candidate notched wins in a handful of key swing states, the Fox News Decision Desk projected.Meanwhile, protests near the White House at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington remained tense as the country awaited clearer presidential election results.CLICK HERE TO SEE FOX NEWS’ LIVE PROBABILITY DIALSTrump, for his part, was projected to take Texas, Florida, Iowa and Ohio, while Biden was projected to win in Arizona and Minnesota.Michigan and Wisconsin have yet to be called, and it appeared full results in Pennsylvania would not come in until Wednesday or even later, after a contentious campaign that was rocked by the coronavirus pandemic. The Fox News Decision Desk also had not called North Carolina, Georgia or Nevada for either candidate.But Trump early Wednesday morning declared that the fact media organizations had not yet called the election in his favor to be ""a fraud on the American public.""""This is an embarrassment to our country,"" Trump said. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.""With several states still counting votes, the Fox News Decision Desk was not projecting winners in those states and therefore was not yet projecting a winner for the presidential election.Trump added Wednesday: ""This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud on our nation ... So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at four o'clock in the morning and add them to the list.""""We will win this and as far as I'm concerned we already have won it,"" the president continued, despite the fact that he has not yet won the election.""The president’s statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect,"" Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens.""With polls now closed nationwide, many votes in some states, particularly Pennsylvania, remained to be counted -- not cast -- as the labor-intensive process of counting mail ballots was set to continue into Wednesday and potentially longer.A razor-thin presidential race could spur after-the-buzzer litigation over votes. There has already been litigation in Pennsylvania that some are speculating could lead to a repeat of the 2000 presidential race when the Supreme Court essentially decided the outcome of the Bush-Gore election.All polls in the United States were closed as of 1 a.m. ET, and as Tuesday night became Wednesday morning the result of the presidential election was far from certain -- with Trump and Biden both approaching the goal of 270 electoral votes.CLICK HERE TO INTERACT WITH FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSISRaces were too early to call in battleground states including Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. And in the all-important battleground Pennsylvania, there were still vast swaths of votes yet to be counted, indicating there may not be a discernable result in the state until Wednesday or later.The race will come down to those states and a handful of others as each candidate hopes he will reach 270 electoral votes, the number necessary to win the presidency, by the time the results are final.The Florida win for Trump was considered necessary for him to reach 270 electoral votes while the win for Biden in Arizona made his path to 270 much clearer -- and the path for Trump significantly more difficult.Ohio, Georgia and North Carolina were considered to be some of the other critical states to Trump's path to victory. Meanwhile, states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were among the most important to Biden.Pennsylvania's meaty 20 electoral votes -- which may not be decided for days due to the time-consuming process of counting an unprecedented volume of mail-in votes -- are considered by many to be the votes that could put either Trump or Biden over the top.The Fox News Decision Desk projects Biden will win Virginia; Vermont; Washington, D.C.; Delaware; Rhode Island; Connecticut; Illinois; Maryland; New Jersey; New York; Colorado; New Hampshire; California; Oregon; Washington state; Arizona; New Mexico; Hawaii; Minnesota; one of Nebraska's five electoral votes; and at least three of Maine's four electoral votes. That represents a total of 238 electoral votes.WHAT TO KNOW ON ELECTION DAY 2020: CULMINATION OF THE BATTLE FOR THE WHITE HOUSEThe Fox News Decision Desk also projects that Trump will win Kentucky; West Virginia; Alabama; Mississippi; Tennessee; Missouri; Arkansas; Indiana; Kansas; Louisiana; Oklahoma; Wyoming; North Dakota; South Dakota; South Carolina; Utah; Idaho; Florida; Ohio; Texas; Iowa; Montana; and at least four of Nebraska's five electoral votes. That represents a total of 213 electoral votes.Election Day Tuesday marked the end of a presidential race where Americans -- who have cast more early and mail ballots this year than in any past election -- had their say on whether to give Trump a second term or go a different direction with Biden.The year 2020 was highly unusual. There was an impeachment trial, an ongoing pandemic, racial protests and riots. The president was diagnosed with the coronavirus and a presidential debate was canceled because Trump refused to participate in a virtual affair after his diagnosis.But despite all of that, votes were being counted into Wednesday morning -- and perhaps a little later -- as Americans sought to elect a president as they have every four years since 1788.""A vote for me and the Republican Party is a vote for the American Dream!"" Trump said in a Monday night tweet as he made his final pitch to voters. ""Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.""FOX NEWS ELECTIONS 2020: SEE THE LIVE RESULTS HERE""We can overcome these crises. We can take our country back. We can win the battle for the soul of the nation,"" Biden said in a Tuesday tweet.There was no obvious winner, however, of the election on Tuesday night or early Wednesday because some states were taking longer than usual to count their mail-in and absentee ballots. Those ballots were more labor-intensive to count than standard ballots that voters cast in person.Some states, including Pennsylvania and North Carolina, also were accepting ballots that were mailed by Election Day but would arrive days later. In Pennsylvania, that period wil last three days while in North Carolina it will last nine.Therefore, with close races in major swing states, and a significant portion of the vote uncounted, it could be days or even longer until there is a clear result of the election.BIDEN PLEDGES TO 'RUN THROUGH THE TAPE' DURING ELECTION DAY STOP IN NATIVE PENNSYLVANIANevertheless, Election Night provided a window into several important issues that could tip the race one way or another: Election Day turnout; vote breakdowns in key counties in swing states; how independents are voting, and more.In addition to the presidential race, which is directing attention to battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and others, the battle for the Senate remained undecided as well.DEMOCRATS RETAIN CONTROL OF HOUSE, BATTLE REMAINS FOR SENATE MAJORITYRaces in states like Maine, North Carolina and more will decide whether Republicans, who are largely on defense this election cycle, will hold onto their majority, or if Democrats can take back the chamber. The races that were called late Tuesday and Wednesday, however, largely turned in favor of Republicans.The makeup of the Senate will be key in how much either Trump or Biden will be able to advance their agendas if elected, especially as the House of Representatives is likely to remain in Democratic hands.The Fox News Decision Desk called expensive races for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., over Democratic challenger Amy McGrath; Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., over Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, over Democratic candidate Theresa Greenfield.Republicans flipped one Senate seat in Alabama, with challenger Tommy Tuberville beating incumbent Democrat Doug Jones, the Fox News Decision Desk projected.The Fox News Decision Desk also projected that Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., will beat Democratic challenger and former Gov. Steve Bullock.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut the Fox News Decision Desk also projected that former Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado will beat incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., in a major flip for Democrats. Democrat challenger Mark Kelly will also unseat Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., according to the Fox News Decision Desk.The Fox News Decision Desk has projected that Democrats will retain control of the majority in the House of Representatives despite what Republicans are calling a successful election night for their House caucus. One notable seat that was flipped: Republican challenger Maria Elvira Salazar beat Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., in her South Florida district.Over the coming hours and days, Americans and the world will find out whether voters chose to continue with the vision of Trump and the Republican Party, or if they chose a new direction with Biden and Democrats.That result, however, could be the subject of intense dispute and eventually take a court decision to finalize.Fox News' Bianca Lumpkin and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
