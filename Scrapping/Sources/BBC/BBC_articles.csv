BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo,UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals,UN investigators say Israel is deliberately targeting health facilities and killing medical workers in Gaza.,4 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:02.988161,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A United Nations commission of inquiry has accused Israel of carrying out a “concerted policy to destroy Gaza's healthcare system"" during its ongoing war with Hamas. The commission said Israeli attacks on Gaza’s healthcare facilities and Israel’s treatment of Palestinian detainees amounted to war crimes, as well as the crime against humanity of “extermination”. Hamas and other Palestinian groups are also accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their treatment of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.  Israel is yet to comment, but has long accused the UN of bias and dismissed previous critical reports. The report, which will be presented to the UN General Assembly on 30 October, was led by Navi Pillay, the South African former UN human rights chief. Israeli security forces have “deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel”, the report said, while children have “borne the brunt” of “the collapse of the health system"". The commission cites the case of five-year-old Hind Rajab, whose car was hit as she and her family tried to flee bombing. Several family members were killed, but Hind managed to phone the Palestinian Red Crescent for help. The ambulance trying to reach her was also shelled, and Hind, her family, and the ambulance crew all died. The commission says the attacks on the healthcare system have “inflicted conditions of life resulting in the destruction of generations of Palestinian children and, potentially, the Palestinian people as a group”. The report alleges Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, have subjected Israeli hostages to ""physical violence, abuse, sexual violence, forced isolation, limited access to hygiene facilities, water and food, threats and humiliation"". It calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining hostages. The report also expresses concern about the treatment of thousands of Palestinian detainees, some of them children. Israeli security forces have subjected them to systematic abuse, including torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, the reports alleges. It directly names Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, saying the abuse took place “under direct orders” from him. The report contains detailed evidence and adds to growing concerns, reflected in a case at the International Court of Justice and investigations by the International Criminal Court, at the conduct of the widening war in the Middle East. The war began after Hamas’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,060 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr3zd4d8y5o,Macron calls to halt arms deliveries to Israel in Gaza war,The French president's call was swiftly criticised by Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu.,6 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:03.088544,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"French President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza on Saturday, prompting swift criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron told France Inter radio that ""the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza"". At a summit in Paris, the French president reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza continuing despite ceasefire calls, and he also criticised Israel's decision to send ground troops into Lebanon. Netanyahu quickly pushed back but during a telephone call between the two leaders on Sunday, Macron reiterated France's ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel. In a video earlier released by his office, Netanyahu said ""Israel will win with orwithout their support"", adding that calling for an arms embargo was ""a disgrace"". ""Shame on them,"" he said, referring to Macron and other Western leaders who have called for what he described as an arms embargo on Israel.  Macron, in an interview with the French broadcaster which was recorded on Tuesday and aired on Saturday, said ""France is not delivering any"" weapons to Israel. He added: ""I think we are not being heard."" ""I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,"" he said, adding that the conflict was leading to ""hatred"". Macron also said that avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a ""priority"" and that ""Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza"". Netanyahu's office responded by saying that any country that did not stand with Israel was supporting Iran and its allies and proxies. Netanyahu said: ""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side. ""Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them."" Macron's office later said that France is a ""steadfast friend of Israel"", adding that Netanyahu's reaction was ""excessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel"". Speaking in Paris on Saturday, Macron said that while both the US and France had called for a ceasefire in Lebanon, he added: ""I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil."" However, Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence and said that he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza on Monday. During a telephone conversation on Sunday, Netanyahu told the French President that Israel's fight against the Hezbollah group would help ""change the reality"" in Lebanon and bring stability to the entire Middle East, a statement from his office said. “Israel’s friends are expected to stand behind it, and not impose restrictions on it that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil,” Netanyahu was reported to have said during their call. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his country's ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel's security, according to his office.  Monday will mark the first anniversary of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8xpqjqx7eo,Empty bars and bookshops: How Israeli strikes transformed Lebanon's buzzing capital,There's no music or dancing in central Beirut bars as fear spreads and displaced people fill the streets.,1 day ago,2024-10-14 18:26:03.190326,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"""Let’s smile so we look better in the pictures they are taking,"" jokes Marwan, the chief waiter at a Beirut hotel. He and a colleague are gazing at the sky, trying to spot the Israeli surveillance drone buzzing overhead. Neither the music playing in the background nor birdsong can mask its deep, humming noise. It’s like someone has left a hairdryer on, or a motorbike is doing laps of the clouds. Marwan’s hotel is not in an area with a strong Hezbollah presence. It’s in Achrafieh, a wealthy Christian quarter that’s not been targeted by Israel in previous wars. It’s also where I am based. Days later, two Israeli missiles roar over Achrafieh. I hear children and adults in the neighbourhood scream. People run to their balconies or open their windows trying to figure out what’s just happened. Within seconds a strong explosion shakes the tree-lined streets. Everyone in my building looks towards Dahieh, the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburb of Beirut which is partly visible from Achrafieh. But soon we realise the strike has hit an area just a five-minute drive away from us. Local media say the target is Wafiq Safa, a high-ranking Hezbollah security official who’s also the brother-in-law of recently killed leader Hassan Nasrallah. He reportedly survives. The building that was hit was full of people who’d recently fled to Beirut. No warning was issued by the Israeli army, and at least 22 people were killed. It was the deadliest attack yet. “Oh my God. What if we were passing through that street?” a neighbour exclaims. “I pass that street to go to work.” “What is the guarantee that next time they won’t hit a building on our street, if they have a target?” another asks. The recent turmoil in Lebanon started on 17 and 18 September, when waves of pager blasts killed at least 32 and left more than 5,000 injured, both Hezbollah fighters and civilians. Many lost their eyes or hands, or both. Air strikes intensified in the south, as well as on Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing high-rank Hezbollah commanders including Nasrallah. On 30 September, Israel invaded southern Lebanon. Officials say more than 1,600 people have been killed in Israel’s bombardment over the past weeks. I’ve seen many of the strikes from my own balcony. The past three weeks have felt like a “fast-forward”, Marwan the waiter tells me. “We haven’t digested what exactly happened.” I’ve spoken to him many times in the past 12 months since tensions erupted between Hezbollah and Israel. He’s lived here his entire life and seen all the wars between the two sides. But he’s always been an optimist, and never believed that this round of fighting would escalate into a war. “I withdraw what I was telling you,” he tells me now. “I didn’t want to believe it but we are at war.” The face of Beirut has completely changed. Streets are packed with cars, some parked in the middle of boulevards. Hundreds fleeing Israeli operations in the south of the country have fled to the capital’s suburbs, sheltering in schools in “safer” neighbourhoods. Many have found themselves sleeping on the streets. On the motorway towards the airport and the south, billboards show Hassan Nasrallah’s face. Both pro- and anti-Hezbollah people tell me these feel surreal. In other areas, posters that previously read “Lebanon doesn’t want war” now say “Pray for Lebanon”. The city’s iconic Martyrs’ Square - usually host to protests and huge Christmas celebrations - has turned into a tent city. Families squeeze under the skeleton of an iron Christmas tree. Around a cut-out clenched fist installed above the square after youth protests in 2019, there are blankets, mattresses and tents made of whatever else people could find. More of the same awaits around every corner. Makeshift homes stretch from the square all the way down to the sea. Most of the families here are Syrian refugees, who’ve found themselves displaced again and barred from shelters which are limited to Lebanese nationals. But many Lebanese families have found themselves homeless too. Just over a kilometre away, 26-year-old Nadine is trying to take her mind off everything for a few hours. She’s one of very few customers at Aaliya’s Books, a bookshop-bar in Beirut’s Gemmayze neighbourhood. “I don’t feel safe any more,” she tells me. “We keep hearing explosions all night. “I keep asking myself: what if they bomb here? What if they target a car in front of us?” For a long time, Beirutis believed that tensions would stay limited to Hezbollah-run border villages in southern Lebanon. Nasrallah, who led the powerful Shia political and military organisation, said he didn’t want to take the country to war, and that the front against Israel was solely to support Palestinians in Gaza. That all changed. In Beirut, although strikes mostly land in the southern suburbs, where Hezbollah dominates, they send shockwaves across the city - resulting in sleepless nights. Businesses are affected. Aaliya's Books is usually a lively place, hosting local bands, podcasts and wine-tasting nights. We were filming here for a report right after the first air strike on Dahieh, on 30 July, which killed Hezbollah’s second-in-command Fuad Shukr. Intense sonic booms could be heard overhead as Israeli jets broke the sound barrier. But a jazz band played all night, with dancing patrons crowding the bar. Now the place is empty, with no music and no dancing. “It is sad and frustrating,” says bar manager Charlie Haber. “You come here to change your mood but again you will end up talking about the situation. Everyone is asking, what is next?” His place closed for two weeks after Nasrallah’s killing. Now they’ve reopened, but shut at 20:00 instead of midnight. Day by day, the psychological strain on staff and customers worsens, says Charlie. Even a post on Instagram takes half a day to write, he adds, because you “don’t want to look like ‘hey, come and enjoy and we’ll give you a discount on drinks’ in this situation”. It’s hard to find anywhere open late any more in this area. Loris, a well-loved restaurant, never used to shut before 01:00 - but now the streets are deserted by 19:00, says one of its owners, Joe Aoun. Three weeks ago you couldn’t get a table here without a reservation. Now, barely two or three tables are taken each day. “We take it day by day. We are sitting here and talking together now, but maybe in five minutes we’ll have to close down and leave.” Most of Loris’s staff come from Beirut’s southern suburbs or villages in the country’s south. “Each day one of them hears that his house is destroyed,” says Joe. One employee, Ali, didn’t come to work for 15 days as he was trying to find somewhere for his family to stay. They’d slept under olive trees in the south for weeks. Joe says Loris is trying to stay open to help staff make a living but he’s not sure how long this can continue. Fuel for the generators is extremely expensive. I see the frustration on his face. “We are against war,” he says. “My staff from the south are Shia but they are against war too. But no one asked for our opinion. We can’t do anything else. We just need to to hold on.” Back at Aaliya’s, both Charlie and Nadine are worried about community tensions rising. These parts of Beirut are mostly Sunni Muslim and Christian - but the new arrivals are largely Shia. “I personally try to help people regardless of their religion or sect but even in my family there are divisions over it. Part of my family only help and accommodate displaced Christians,” she says. Out in the squares and alleys of Achrafieh and Gemmayze, more and more flags can be seen of Lebanese Forces, a Christian party that strongly opposes Hezbollah. The party has a long history of armed conflict with Shia Muslims, as well as Muslim and Palestinian parties during the civil war, three decades ago. Nadine thinks this is a message to displaced Shias who have recently arrived, saying “don’t come here”. With the movement of people, there are also fears that Israel can now target any building in any neighbourhood in its search for Hezbollah fighters or members of allied groups. Hezbollah says its high-ranking officials do not stay in places assigned to displaced people. None of this bodes well for local businesses. Many in Gemmayze were already badly affected by the Beirut port explosion four years ago, which killed 200 people and destroyed more than 70,000 buildings. They’d only recently started getting back on their feet. Despite the financial crisis, new places were springing up in the area - but many of them have closed now. Maya Bekhazi Noun, an entrepreneur and board member of the restaurant and bar owners’ syndicate, estimates that 85% of food and drink spots in downtown Beirut have shut down or limited their opening hours. “Everything happened so fast and we couldn’t do any statistics yet but I can tell you more around 85 percent of food and beverage places in downtown Beirut are closed or working for limited hours only.” “It is difficult to keep the places open for joy when there are many people are sleeping without enough food and supplies nearby.” Despite the tough situation in Beirut, you can still find bustling restaurants and bars around a 15 minute-drive north. But Maya says that too is temporary. “Strikes may happen in other locations too. There have been attacks on some places in the north. There is no guarantee they will be safe either.” It’s like someone pressed a button and life stopped in Beirut, she says. “We are on hold. We were aware of the war in the south - and somehow affected by it too - but many like me didn’t expect the war to come this close.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c749rn1832do,Plaid Cymru backs calls for Israel boycott,At conference Plaid Cymru calls for economic and cultural boycott of Israel in vote over Gaza war.,2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:03.296559,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Plaid Cymru members have called for a sporting and economic boycott of Israel over the war in Gaza in a vote at their party conference on Saturday. The party's Westminster MPs backed a motion which described Israel an ""apartheid state"" and accused it of ""ethnic cleansing and war crimes"". It came after the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, Husam Zomlot, called for Wales to pressure the UK government at conference on Saturday afternoon. He told the conference Israel must be ""compelled"" to comply with international law. He accused the country of ""waging war on the global rules based order"", and was applauded when he called for an arms embargo of the country, and for the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine. Saying Israel was committing a ""genocide"", Mr Zomlot added: ""It is heart-breaking that death in Gaza has become the best of options, the easiest of options."" About 1,200 people - mostly Israeli civilians - were killed in the Hamas 7 October attacks just over one year ago.  Since then, some 42,000 people have been killed as part of Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The motion proposed by the party's members in Ceredigion and backed by Plaid's MPs condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the ""murders of tens of thousands of Palestinians, including over 10,000 children, by the state of Israel"". It criticised the ""violence perpetrated by Hamas against innocent people in Israel"" but says the ""increasingly oppressive apartheid regime maintained by the Israeli government makes a two-state solution less likely to bring about a just peace"". The motion said the UK government should ""expel the Israeli ambassador"", ban arms sales to Israel, and that all Plaid members should support an ""economic and cultural boycott"". That would include Welsh national sports teams boycotting the country. It also said councils should divest from companies that ""support the apartheid Israeli state"". Ben Lake, MP for Ceredigion Preseli who proposed the motion at conference, said: “We should offer no assistance to states that are in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions and ICJ rulings.  ""We urgently need a political settlement to this war – that should include official recognition of Palestinian statehood.” The Plaid motion cited Amnesty International, which in 2022 said Israel's laws, policies and practices against Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories amounted to apartheid. It said it maintained ""an institutionalised regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis"". At the time, Israel's foreign ministry had accused Amnesty of recycling ""lies, inconsistencies, and unfounded assertions that originate from well-known anti-Israeli hate organisations"". Palestinians have accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, which the country has denied. The UN human rights special rapporteur Francesa Albanese has said she believes Israel has committed ""acts of genocide"", while the International Court of Justice ruled in January that the country should ""take all measures to prevent genocidal acts"". In an interview with the BBC, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth hinted at a difference of opinion on the matter, declining to confirm whether he personally endorsed the motion. Ap Iorwerth said Israel had acted contrary to international law. ""Individuals will take different positions on matters like boycotts,"" he said. ""Those attacks a year ago were appalling, and we condemn them. We need to see the release of surviving hostages, but we also need to call out the state of Israel."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dj0nrdv1no,Hezbollah rockets hit northern Israeli city of Haifa,"The overnight rocket fire caused damage and injured eight people, Israeli authorities say.",7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:03.394587,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The northern Israeli port city of Haifa was hit by about five rockets fired by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah late on Sunday, causing damage and injuring eight people, Israeli authorities say. A spokesman for Haifa's municipality said it was the first time the city had been targeted since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it was investigating how its air defences failed to intercept the rockets. Hezbollah said it targeted a military base south of Haifa. Another person was injured when a barrage of rockets hit the town of Tiberias, which is located to the east on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes carried out a new round of air strikes in the Lebanese capital. Beirut, hitting what the military said were Hezbollah targets. The military also said a third division had joined its invasion of southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said its fighters were targeting Israeli troops in and around border villages. Israel’s government has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the Gaza war. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. Hezbollah has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, insisting on Monday that it was confident in its ability to “repel the [Israeli] aggression”. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Hezbollah fired more than 135 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday. Approximately five projectiles crossed from Lebanon after air raid sirens sounded in the Carmel and Bay areas of Haifa at 23:22 local time (20:22 GMT), an IDF statement said. “Interceptors were fired. Fallen projectiles were identified in the area. The incident is under review,” it added. Eliran Tal, spokesman for the Haifa municipality, told the BBC that two neighbourhoods were hit. BBC Verify geolocated CCTV footage showing the moment that one of the rockets hit a roundabout near a supermarket and several apartment blocks in the west of the city. In another video, emergency services and bystanders are seen inspecting a crater and piles of rubble and earth at the scene. Tal Rosen, a member of the emergency services, told Reuters news agency that he had been inside his home about 500m (1,640ft) away when he heard an explosion. “In the beginning, we didn't find any injuries and then I saw in this building,” he said, pointing to damaged windows on the side of a nearby apartment block. “There were shards of glass in this building. I went inside and I found four people [with] minor to moderate [injuries]."" Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said it treated a 13-year-old boy in a moderate condition with shrapnel injuries to his head, as well as a 22-year-old man in a moderate condition with both a blast injury and a head injury from falling through a window. Hezbollah said it launched ""a salvo of Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa” late on Sunday in retaliation for the Israeli air strike that killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah last month. Mr Tal dismissed Hezbollah's claim,  saying it was ""an attack on civilian population"". He estimated that 95% of Haifa's population of 280,000 was staying put. ""With missile threats from the north, it is not an easy period of time. But we are strong,"" he said. ""We went through a lot of tragedy like this - and I hope the IDF and the leadership will do their best to push the enemy far from the border."" The MDA also reported that a man in his 20s was in a serious but stable condition and suffering from shrapnel injuries to his chest and abdomen following a separate rocket attack on the town of Tiberias, about 50km (30 miles) to the east. The IDF said approximately 15 projectiles were identified as crossing from Lebanon at the same time as the Haifa attack. Some were intercepted while others fell in the area, it added. The Israeli police said some buildings and properties were damaged."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3x1w0595o,Netanyahu warns Lebanon of 'destruction like Gaza',Benjamin Netanyahu's appeal came as Israel expanded its ground invasion against Hezbollah.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:03.497909,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's prime minister has urged the Lebanese people to throw out Hezbollah and avoid ""destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza"". Benjamin Netanyahu's appeal on Tuesday came as Israel expanded its invasion against Hezbollah by sending thousands more troops into a new zone in south-west Lebanon. Its military said 50 Hezbollah members were killed in air strikes on Monday. The Lebanese health ministry said 36 people were killed and 150 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Hezbollah launched barrages of rockets towards the Israeli port of Haifa for the third consecutive day, injuring 12 people. During a video address directed at the people of Lebanon, Netanyahu said: ""You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza. ""I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end."" Netanyahu also claimed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had killed the successor to Hezbollah's late leader, Hassan Nasrallah.  ""We have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities; we took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,"" he said. Hashem Safieddine, a top Hezbollah official widely expected to succeed his cousin Nasrallah as leader, has not been heard from publicly since an Israeli air strike reportedly targeted him in Beirut last Thursday. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday evening it could not confirm that Safieddine was killed in the attack, adding that it was examining the results of the operation. Hezbollah has remained defiant despite three weeks of intense Israeli strikes and other attacks that Lebanese officials say have killed more than 1,400 people and displaced another 1.2 million. Earlier on Tuesday, Nasrallah's former deputy, Naim Qassem, insisted Hezbollah had overcome the recent “painful blows” from Israel and that its capabilities were “fine”. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. On Tuesday morning, the IDF announced that reservists from its 146th Division had begun “limited, localized, targeted operational activities” in south-western Lebanon. It joined three standing army divisions which have been operating in central and eastern areas of southern Lebanon since the invasion began on 30 September - reportedly bringing the total number of soldiers deployed to over 15,000. The IDF said troops had taken control of what it called a Hezbollah “combat compound” in the border village of Maroun al-Ras and published photos showing what it said was a loaded rocket launcher in an olive grove, as well as weapons and equipment inside a residential building. Drone footage meanwhile showed widespread destruction in the nearby village of Yaroun, which was an initial target of the invasion. Meanwhile, the UN special co-ordinator for Lebanon and the head of the UN peacekeeping force warned in a joint statement that the humanitarian impact of the conflict was “nothing short of catastrophic”. Lebanon’s government says as many as 1.2 million people have fled their homes over the past year. Almost 180,000 people are in approved centres for the displaced. In addition, more than 400,000 people have fled into war-torn Syria, including more than 200,000 Syrian refugees - a situation that the head of the UN’s refugee agency described as one of “tragic absurdity”. The World Food Programme said there was “extraordinary concern for Lebanon's ability to continue to feed itself” because thousands of hectares of farmland had been burned or abandoned. The IDF also said its aircraft had carried out a new round of strikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where the group has a strong presence, and other areas of Lebanon on Tuesday. Earlier, it announced that a strike in the capital on Monday had killed the commander of Hezbollah’s headquarters, Suhail Husseini.  Hezbollah did not comment on the claim. But if confirmed, it would be the latest in a series of severe blows Israel has dealt to the group, with Hassan Nasrallah and most of its military commanders having been killed in similar recent strikes. Hezbollah's deputy leader said in a defiant televised address from an undisclosed location on Tuesday that its command and control was “solid” and had “no vacant positions”, citing its attacks on Israel in recent days. ""We are hurting them and we will prolong the time. Dozens of cities are within range of the resistance's missiles. We assure you that our capabilities are fine,"" Naim Qassem said. But, for the first time, he made no mention of ending the war in Gaza as a pre-condition where previously Hezbollah has said it would not stop attacking Israel until the Gaza conflict is over. ""We support the political efforts that (Lebanese Parliament Speaker) Nabih Berri is undertaking towards a ceasefire,"" Qassem said in a televised speech. ""Once a ceasefire is achieved, diplomacy can look into all the other details."" It was not clear if this meant a change in Hezbollah’s position. The speech coincided with the launch of more than 100 rockets towards Haifa Bay, as well as the Lower, Central and Upper Galilee regions. The IDF said most of the rockets were intercepted. There were no serious casualties.  On Sunday night, there was a direct hit on Haifa - something which had not happened since Israel and Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80r9zyk89yo,Inside Israel's combat zone in southern Lebanon,The BBC's Lucy Williamson travels with the Israeli military to a village destroyed during its fighting with Hezbollah.,2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:03.593959,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli army vehicles had already pounded the dirt road into dust where we crossed into Lebanon, breaking through a hole in the fence that marks the ceasefire line drawn between the two countries a generation ago. The ceasefire itself is already in tatters. Israel’s ground invasion along this border last week was launched, it said, to destroy Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”. Ten days on, the army was taking us to a village a couple of miles into Lebanese territory, where it had just established “some level of control”. We were told not to reveal where it is, for military reasons, and our movements were restricted. Israeli artillery was blasting through the air as we arrived. The brigade commander, Col Yaniv Malka, told us the area was still not clear of Hezbollah fighters. Bursts of small-arms fire were from fighting that was taking place 500m away, he said, describing “face-to-face combat” with Hezbollah fighters inside the village just a couple of days before – meaning, he said, “my troops seeing in their eyes, and fighting them in the streets”. All along the central path through the village, houses lay demolished; piles of rubble leaching glimpses of family life. Buildings left standing were shot through with artillery, missing corners or walls and peppered with gunshot and shrapnel holes. Two tanks sat in churned up earth near what was once a village square. The level of destruction around them is reminiscent of Gaza. Our movements on the ground were restricted by the army to a limited area of the village, but neighbouring buildings and communities appeared, from a distance, to be untouched. These incursions seem – so far – to be more “limited and targeted” geographically than militarily. The graffiti on a building commandeered by troops read: “We wanted peace, you wanted war”. “Most of the terrorists ran away,” Col Malka told me. “[But] dozens of houses were booby-trapped.  When we went house to house, we discovered booby-traps and weapons. We had no choice but to destroy them.” We only have the army’s account of what happened here. I asked an army spokesman whether any women or children were present when the operation here began. He replied that all civilians had been given ample warning to leave. The human rights group Amnesty International this week described Israel’s evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon as inadequate and overly general, and said they did not absolve the country of its obligations under international law. We were also shown three caches of weapons it said were found inside civilian homes here, including boxes of brand-new mortars, new anti-tank missiles and mines, as well as sophisticated shoulder launched rockets and night-scopes. One anti-tank missile we saw was already semi-assembled. The chief of staff for the 91st Division, Roy Russo, also showed us a garage he said had been used as an equipment warehouse, with sleeping bags, body armour, rifles and ammunition hidden in a large barrel. “This is what we call an exchange zone,” he said. “They’re morphing from civilians into combatants. All this gear is designed to manoeuvre into [Israel] and conduct operations on the Israeli side. This is not defensive equipment.” This, Israel says, is why it launched its invasion of southern Lebanon; that Hezbollah’s stockpiles of weapons and equipment along this border were planning for a cross-border attack similar to last year’s 7 October attacks by Hamas in southern Israel. At the start of this invasion, the army revealed that Israeli special forces had been operating across the Lebanese border in small tactical units for almost a year, conducting more than 70 raids to find and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including underground tunnels – one of which, it said, stopped 30m (100ft) before the ceasefire line with Israel and was unfinished. Col Malka showed me some of the weapons he said the army found on the day we arrived. They include a large IED, an anti-personnel mine, and a high-tech night-scope. He said troops were finding “two to three times” the number of weapons they found in Gaza, with “thousands” of weapons and thousands of pieces of ammunition found in this village alone. “We don’t want to hold these places,” he told me. “We want to take all the ammunition and fighting equipment out.  After that, we expect the people will come back, and understand that peace is better for them, and terrorist control over them in a bad thing.” “But I’ll leave that to the diplomats to solve,” he smiled. After the last ground war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, the UN ruled that Hezbollah must pull back north of the Litani River.  A previous resolution also ordered its disarmament.  Neither decision has been enforced. That ground war in 2006 was a wake-up call for Israel. The Iran-backed militia fought its army to standstill.  For almost 20 years, both sides have been avoiding – and preparing for – the next one. Col Malka fought in Lebanon during that war.  “This one is different,” he said. When I asked why, he replied: “Because of 7th October.” As we were speaking, the sound of small-arms fire grew louder. He gestured towards it. “That’s my guys fighting in the casbah,” he said. Israel's ground invasion is part of a dramatic escalation against Hezbollah over the past three weeks that has also seen it intensify air strikes on southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut. Lebanon says more than 2,200 people have been killed, mainly during the recent escalation, and more than a million people displaced.  Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields.  One commander described the ground war as an offensive operation to defend Israeli citizens - an invasion to stop an invasion, in other words. But the speed with which Israel’s forces have been moving through villages along this border may only be the first chapter in this story. Hezbollah tactics have shifted since the ground invasion began, with Israeli towns like Metula – surrounded on three sides by Lebanon – reporting a drop in direct fire from anti-tank missiles, and a rise in rockets fired out of sight from further away. The assessment of many is that Hezbollah fighters have not run away, but simply withdrawn further back into Lebanon. Israel already has four divisions lined up at this border – and a growing chorus of voices inside the country who say this is the moment, not just to push back Hezbollah, but to remake the Middle East. As the fighting near the village intensified, we were told to leave immediately, hurried out to the waiting convoy. Under the shadow of a growing conflict with Iran, Israel’s small successes along this frontier don’t change one key fact: this is not actually a border war, it’s a regional war being fought along a border."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r89qwwx2lo,The week that pushed the Middle East closer to all-out war,There have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. This is the worst.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:03.703309,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"There have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. This is the worst. In the past seven days, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. Western and regional powers - led by the US - have pushed for de-escalation. The UN Security Council called for an ""immediate end"" to hostilities and the G7, which includes the US, UK and Germany, has called for “restraint”. But so far those efforts have failed - and the Middle East stands closer than ever to all-out war. Here’s how the last week played out. As the sun set over Beirut on 27 September, the south of the city was hit by a series of huge explosions. Several apartment buildings had been struck, leaving a huge crater in the ground. Plumes of dust and debris filled the skyline, visible from across the Lebanese capital. The strike, aimed at an underground bunker, killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Seen as a prize-target, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for years for fear of being assassinated by Israel. His death capped a week of ramped-up Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah that had left more than 500 people dead. The week before that, a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions targeting the group left at least 32 dead and over 3000 injured. Nasrallah’s death wiped all hopes of a de-escalation, which just hours earlier had seemed possible. A US proposal for a 21-day ceasefire had been discussed on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York. Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon had even said his side was “open to ideas”. But hours after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on an early flight home from the UN - and any lingering hopes of diplomacy prevailing faded away.  Three days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon, marking the start of a ground invasion. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its operations would be “limited and targeted”. Fighting so far has driven nearly 1.2 million people from their homes, according to Lebanon’s crisis unit. At least 8 Israeli soldiers have been killed. Israel says the operation is aimed at stopping Hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and drones over the border – something it has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the current Gaza war. Now Israeli troops are fighting a ground war on two fronts simultaneously: Gaza and Lebanon. That hasn’t happened in decades. The last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, ended inconclusively with UN Resolution 1701, which stipulated Hezbollah withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon. That never happened, and with Iranian support, Hezbollah grew in strength. Israel has not said that it wants to remove Hezbollah entirely from Lebanon’s political landscape (as it has with Hamas in Gaza), but for all its talk of this being a “limited and targeted” operation, it’s clear that Israel is ruthlessly determined to cut Hezbollah down in size. Spurred by an astonishing two and a half weeks, Israel is in an ambitious frame of mind. The next day, at around 19:30 local time, 10 million Israelis were sent running for bomb shelters across the country after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The nation's air defence system sprang into action - and allies including the US and UK were involved in repelling the attack - another sign of the broadening scope of the conflict. The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern Israel. The only person reported to have been killed was a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank. With its biggest proxy group in disarray, Tehran calculated that to restore some semblance of deterrence it needed to do something more dramatic than its last well-telegraphed missile and drone attack on Israel in April. Hence the larger number of ballistic missiles and the lack of advance notice. But while the attack was more than purely demonstrative, it did not appear to signal Iran’s desire for an all-out fight. That’s hardly surprising. If it came to a full-on war, Iran knows that it would lose, and badly. It could even herald the end of the Islamic Republic. Israel, with powerful western allies - and a smattering of Middle Eastern neighbours willing to help shoot down Iranian missiles - is a regional superpower. Iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match. Nor does it have the sort of allies that would be willing to spring to its defence in the event of a confrontation. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, made suitably defiant noises at Friday prayers in Tehran, but Iran knows it cannot afford to escalate much further. Despite Hezbollah’s devastating losses, it has vowed to fight on in Lebanon. And history shows us it is easy for Israel to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. As for Israel’s response to Iran, the region - and the world - has been on tenterhooks since Tuesday. US president Joe Biden said he has discouraged Israel from striking Iranian nuclear or oil facilities as part of its retaliation.  A severe reaction seems inevitable, though, and some of Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent rhetoric suggests that he might be thinking, ultimately, of regime change in Iran. But Israel’s immediate objectives are closer to home. “Total victory” in Gaza and removing the threat posed by Hezbollah along the northern border. Israeli leaders point out that they at war on many fronts. Benjamin Netanyahu says there are seven: Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Yemen, Iran, Iraq and Syria. It’s true that over the past year, attacks have come from all these directions, even though pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria have so far posed little real threat. We’re not seeing an all-out regional war just yet, but with so many players feeling they have a stake in it, the war in Gaza has metastasised in a dramatic fashion."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g57q20l1vo,Israel marks year since Hamas attack as fighting rages on multiple fronts,Vigils have been held across Israel including at the festival where hundreds were killed last October.,6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:03.802642,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has held ceremonies to remember the victims of the mass killings and abductions carried out by Hamas on 7 October 2023, against a backdrop of continuing fighting in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. A year on from the attack - that saw some 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage - Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to stop such an assault happening again, saying Israel's armed forces were “changing the security reality” of the region. Since 7 October, nearly 42,000 people have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. As the day of commemorations unfolded, Israel said it had intercepted more than 100 rockets fired by Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as projectiles launched by Yemen's Houthis and from Hamas in Gaza. Overnight, rocket warning sirens continued to sound in northern Israel, and several more town were declared closed military zones, as Israel looks set to expand its ground offensive across the Lebanon border. On Tuesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Suhail Hussein Husseini, Hezbollah's logistics commander, was killed in a ""precise, intelligence-based strike in the area of Beirut"" on Monday. Hezbollah has not commented. Husseini was responsible for the budgeting and logistical management of Hezbollah's most sensitive projects, including its war plans and other special operations, the IDF said. The US has indicated that it supports targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon - but fears that what has been described as a limited operation by Israel could quickly turn into a larger-scale, prolonged conflict.  And as American and Israeli officials discuss Israel’s response to last week’s unprecedented Iranian missile attack, CIA director William Burns has warned that there is a ""very real danger of a further regional escalation"".  Last October, gunmen from Hamas in Gaza broke through the border fence and rampaged through nearby Israeli villages, Kibbutzim, military posts and the Nova music festival. On Monday, families of the hundreds killed and dozens of people taken hostage at the festival gathered at the site early for the first memorial event of the day. Holding pictures of loved ones they listened to the last track played at the festival before Israeli President Isaac Herzog led a minute's silence at 06:29, the moment that the attack began. In nearby communities also attacked by Hamas gunmen, smaller events were held. Elsewhere, Netanyahu visited the Iron Sword memorial in Jerusalem for victims of the Hamas attacks, lighting a candle to ""remember our fallen, our hostages"".  In Tel Aviv's biggest park, Israeli families gathered for an event billed as the Bereaved Families Memorial Ceremony, which served as an alternative to the official government memorial ceremony. Some of Israel's most popular singers gave emotional performances, while images of victims flashed on the screens. The stage was adorned with items symbolising the attacks including burnt and broken cars from the Nova music festival, and a child’s bicycle and swing set from the Be’eri kibbutz. Outside Israel, US President Joe Biden joined other world leaders in condemning what the ""unspeakable brutality"" of the Hamas attacks a year ago. He also expressed horror at the subsequent war, saying ""far too many civilians had suffered, far too much"". Mourners also gathered at vigils around the world including in Australia, South Africa, Germany and the US. In the UK, Sir Keir Starmer told the House of Commons he supported Israel's right to defend itself. But Britain's prime minister insisted there was no military solution to the current crisis and appealed for all sides to ""step back"". However as the memorial services took place, the wider conflict in the region raged. The Israeli military said Hezbollah had fired more than 130 rockets across the border from Lebanon. Most were shot down, but some hit the cities of Haifa and Tiberius. Earlier Hamas also launched rockets at Tel Aviv from Gaza. The army said ballistic missiles had been fired at Israel from Yemen but had been intercepted. Through the day, Israel carried out multiple air strikes and several ground incursions in Lebanon. The Israeli military said it was expanding operations against Hezbollah, warning residents in southern Lebanon to avoid using boats in the sea or rivers south of the Awali river. Three weeks of intense Israeli strikes and other attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 1,400 people, and displaced another 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Hezbollah - a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon - has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, including the killing of its leader and most of its top military commanders. On Monday, the group insisted it was “confident... in the ability of our resistance to oppose the Israeli aggression”. Israel’s government - which designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation - has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the Gaza war. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80r9zyk89yo,Inside Israel's combat zone in southern Lebanon,The BBC's Lucy Williamson travels with the Israeli military to a village destroyed during its fighting with Hezbollah.,2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:17.619254,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli army vehicles had already pounded the dirt road into dust where we crossed into Lebanon, breaking through a hole in the fence that marks the ceasefire line drawn between the two countries a generation ago. The ceasefire itself is already in tatters. Israel’s ground invasion along this border last week was launched, it said, to destroy Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in “limited, localised, targeted raids”. Ten days on, the army was taking us to a village a couple of miles into Lebanese territory, where it had just established “some level of control”. We were told not to reveal where it is, for military reasons, and our movements were restricted. Israeli artillery was blasting through the air as we arrived. The brigade commander, Col Yaniv Malka, told us the area was still not clear of Hezbollah fighters. Bursts of small-arms fire were from fighting that was taking place 500m away, he said, describing “face-to-face combat” with Hezbollah fighters inside the village just a couple of days before – meaning, he said, “my troops seeing in their eyes, and fighting them in the streets”. All along the central path through the village, houses lay demolished; piles of rubble leaching glimpses of family life. Buildings left standing were shot through with artillery, missing corners or walls and peppered with gunshot and shrapnel holes. Two tanks sat in churned up earth near what was once a village square. The level of destruction around them is reminiscent of Gaza. Our movements on the ground were restricted by the army to a limited area of the village, but neighbouring buildings and communities appeared, from a distance, to be untouched. These incursions seem – so far – to be more “limited and targeted” geographically than militarily. The graffiti on a building commandeered by troops read: “We wanted peace, you wanted war”. “Most of the terrorists ran away,” Col Malka told me. “[But] dozens of houses were booby-trapped.  When we went house to house, we discovered booby-traps and weapons. We had no choice but to destroy them.” We only have the army’s account of what happened here. I asked an army spokesman whether any women or children were present when the operation here began. He replied that all civilians had been given ample warning to leave. The human rights group Amnesty International this week described Israel’s evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon as inadequate and overly general, and said they did not absolve the country of its obligations under international law. We were also shown three caches of weapons it said were found inside civilian homes here, including boxes of brand-new mortars, new anti-tank missiles and mines, as well as sophisticated shoulder launched rockets and night-scopes. One anti-tank missile we saw was already semi-assembled. The chief of staff for the 91st Division, Roy Russo, also showed us a garage he said had been used as an equipment warehouse, with sleeping bags, body armour, rifles and ammunition hidden in a large barrel. “This is what we call an exchange zone,” he said. “They’re morphing from civilians into combatants. All this gear is designed to manoeuvre into [Israel] and conduct operations on the Israeli side. This is not defensive equipment.” This, Israel says, is why it launched its invasion of southern Lebanon; that Hezbollah’s stockpiles of weapons and equipment along this border were planning for a cross-border attack similar to last year’s 7 October attacks by Hamas in southern Israel. At the start of this invasion, the army revealed that Israeli special forces had been operating across the Lebanese border in small tactical units for almost a year, conducting more than 70 raids to find and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including underground tunnels – one of which, it said, stopped 30m (100ft) before the ceasefire line with Israel and was unfinished. Col Malka showed me some of the weapons he said the army found on the day we arrived. They include a large IED, an anti-personnel mine, and a high-tech night-scope. He said troops were finding “two to three times” the number of weapons they found in Gaza, with “thousands” of weapons and thousands of pieces of ammunition found in this village alone. “We don’t want to hold these places,” he told me. “We want to take all the ammunition and fighting equipment out.  After that, we expect the people will come back, and understand that peace is better for them, and terrorist control over them in a bad thing.” “But I’ll leave that to the diplomats to solve,” he smiled. After the last ground war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, the UN ruled that Hezbollah must pull back north of the Litani River.  A previous resolution also ordered its disarmament.  Neither decision has been enforced. That ground war in 2006 was a wake-up call for Israel. The Iran-backed militia fought its army to standstill.  For almost 20 years, both sides have been avoiding – and preparing for – the next one. Col Malka fought in Lebanon during that war.  “This one is different,” he said.

The gunman was shot dead at the scene after what police described as a ""suspected terror attack"" at the city's central bus station. The victim has been named as Shira Chaya Suslik, 19, a sergeant from Israel's border police.  Israel's ambulance service said medics are treating ten people for injuries, some of whom suffered gunshot wounds.  One of the injured is in a “moderate to serious” condition and four others are in a “moderate condition”, the ambulance service said. They have been taken to the nearby Soroka Hospital. Police said a preliminary investigation showed the gunman was ""eliminated in a few seconds by the security forces"" who were there.  Shortly after the attack, Israel’s Transport Minister Miri Regev called for the families of “terrorists” to be deported from the country. “The time has come for a deterrent punishment to prevent the attacks on Israeli territory,” she wrote on X. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid described the attack as ""severe and despicable"", writing on X ""we must act hard against terrorism"".  Last week, seven people were killed in a shooting and knife attack in Tel Aviv after a gunman opened fire at members of the public in the Jaffa area. Israeli authorities have said they are on high alert across the country ahead of the one year anniversary of Hamas’s assault on southern Israel on 7 October last year, which triggered the current Gaza war."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lr0jd37xo,The two forces at work on Biden-Netanyahu phone call,"The US fears getting dragged into a war with Iran, while some Israelis want to deal it a body blow, Jeremy Bowen writes.",5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:17.813816,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have held a much-anticipated 30-minute phone call - believed to be their first contact since August - which included discussions on Israel’s intended retaliation to Iran’s missile strike last week. The White House described the dialogue as ""direct"" and ""productive"", and said Biden and Netanyahu had agreed to stay in ""close contact"" in coming days. Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the call. Speaking shortly afterwards, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said its attack against Iran would be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising"". Two forces are at work. One is Joe Biden’s reluctance to see the US dragged into a war with Iran that it believes would be unnecessary and dangerous.  The other is a strong sense among some in Israel that they have an opportunity to deal a body blow to Iran - their mortal enemy. Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah has energised Israelis who were desperate to break out of the grinding war of attrition on their border with Lebanon.  Lebanon, for them, felt like success and progress, a stark contrast to the position in Gaza.  Despite Israel’s onslaught on Gaza that has killed at least 42,000 people, most of them civilians, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been able to deliver his two war aims – the destruction of Hamas and the recovery of the hostages.  Hamas is still fighting, and still holds around 100 hostages, many of whom might be dead. The damage done to Israel’s enemies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, has produced in some Israelis an urgent conviction to go further and mount a direct assault on Iran.  For them, a devastating air attack on Iran is a seductive prospect.  Top of the target list for many Israelis are the heavily fortified sites, some driven deep into mountains where Iran houses nuclear facilities that Israel and others fear could be used to make a bomb. President Biden has made clear the US opposes the idea.  The US believes Iran is not about to make a nuclear weapon. An attack could push them to construct one. One of the most prominent voices in Israel pressing Netanyahu to ignore US wishes is former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett who says Israel must not hesitate to act against what he calls the Iranian octopus.  He told me that it was ""the 11th hour"". Like the opposition politician and former general Benny Gantz, Bennett believes Iran is weaker than it has been for decades because of the damage done to Hezbollah and Hamas. “Essentially Iran was defending itself with two arms, Hezbollah and Hamas. They were sort of its insurance policy against a strike,"" Bennett says.  ""But now both of those arms are pretty much neutralised.” Bennett sees the moment as a once in a generation opportunity to do real damage to Iran’s Islamic Regime. He adds: “Here's the thing. The strategy with Iran - ultimately it's not going to happen tomorrow.  ""We need to accelerate the demise of this regime. This is a regime that will fall. “If Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, the likelihood that they'll use it in order to save the regime is high. And that means that they’re going to turn the whole Middle East into a nuclear nightmare.” Bennett recalled two Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities he believes made the Middle East much safer - in Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. “People don't like it,"" Bennett says. ""But we saved the world from [Bashar al-] Assad with nuclear weapons.  ""We have the thankless job of taking out the nuclear facilities of the worst regimes in the world. Everyone likes to criticise us, but we're doing that job.  ""And if they get that bomb, it's everyone's problem. It's not our problem. I want to see how Londoners will feel when there's an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear bomb. We cannot allow that to happen.” Iran and Israel have been in direct conflict since April, after Israel assassinated leading Iranian generals with a big airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Syria.  Iran’s retaliation was a missile strike on Israel. The escalation has continued.  The latest came on Tuesday last week in response to Israel’s assault on Iran's ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah.  Iran unleashed a huge ballistic missile attack, and Israel’s prime minister vowed to hit back. President Biden was reluctant to restrain Israel in Gaza. And has ""urged"" Israel to minimise harm to civilians in Lebanon. But he has been adamant that Israel must not answer the Iranians with a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities.  The US believes Iran is not about to make a nuclear weapon.  President Biden has said Israel must defend itself – but not by attacking Iranian nuclear sites – or its oil industry.   The US fears getting dragged into a war it doesn’t want. And there are concerns that if Iran can ride out an attack it will go for broke to produce a nuclear warhead for its missiles. The next phases in this spiralling war depend on the extent of Israel’s retaliation – which may come any day now."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m93l9krgro,Iran gambles with Israel attack after humiliating blows to allies,Iran's leaders brace for Israeli retaliation after firing about 200 ballistic missiles.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:17.923094,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), Maj-Gen Hossein Salami, stood in front of a large banner in a war room as he used a telephone to order the launch of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday night, according to a video clip published by Iranian media. The banner featured photos of the three men whose deaths he said Iran was seeking to avenge with the major attack - Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July in an attack that Iran blamed on Israel, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC Quds Force operations commander Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, who were killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut last week. The IRGC claimed the barrage included Fattah hypersonic missiles that took 12 minutes to reach Israel and that they successfully hit targets including three Israeli airbases and the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency. However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said most of the missiles were “intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States”, and that there were a “small number of hits” in central and southern Israel. Shortly after the attack, a massive banner was raised in Tehran’s Palestine Square, featuring missiles flying towards buildings shaped like a Star of David and the words “The beginning of the end of Zionism”. Iran had appeared to show restraint after Haniyeh's assassination - but this inaction became a source of humiliation when Israel dealt a series of devastating blows to Iran’s closest and most longstanding regional ally Hezbollah, culminating in the air strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah and Nilforoushan. Iranian weapons, training and funding have been pivotal to Hezbollah’s transformation into Lebanon’s most powerful armed force and political actor since the IRGC helped establish the group in the 1980s. Before this month, Iranian leaders had hoped that a war of attrition with Hezbollah would help wear down the Israeli military, which is still fighting a war against Hamas in Gaza. They also relied on Hezbollah and its massive arsenal of rockets and missiles to serve as a major deterrent against direct Israeli attacks on their country’s nuclear and missile facilities. President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, accused Israel of trying to provoke Iran into a regional war that would also draw in the US. ""We also want security and peace. It was Israel that assassinated Haniyeh in Tehran,"" he was quoted by Iranian media as saying during a visit to Qatar on Wednesday. ""Europeans and the US said that if we do not act, there will be a peace in Gaza in one week. We waited for them to have peace but they increased their killing."" Many hardline conservatives in Iran had been growing uneasy about the country's lack of action against Israel. Several commentators on state TV - which is controlled by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the IRGC - argued that the decision to hold back from seeking revenge for Haniyeh’s killing had emboldened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's interests and allies in Lebanon. After Tuesday's missile attack, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Maj Gen Mohammad Baqeri stated that the time for “patience and restraint” was over. “We targeted military and intelligence sites in Israel and deliberately refrained from hitting economic and industrial locations,” he said. “However, if Israel retaliates, our response will be more forceful.” The missile attack reflects a growing concern among Iranian leaders that remaining silent after Israel's attacks would portray them as weak and vulnerable - both domestically and in the eyes of their regional allies in the so-called “Axis of Resistance” which includes Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran and Israel have pursued a shadow war for decades, adhering to a policy of “no war, no peace”. However, it now appears that this status quo is ending.  Israel has vowed to respond severely, with Netanyahu warning that ""Iran made a big mistake and it will pay for it"". There are also indications of a shift in tone and strategy from the US. In April, President Joe Biden urged restraint after Israeli and US-led forces shot down most of the 300 drones and missiles that Iran launched at Israel in retaliation for an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria that killed several top IRGC commanders. Israel heeded the US call and responded by launching a missile that hit an Iranian air defence battery in central Iran. But this time, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned there would be “severe consequences” for the Iranian attack and that the US will “work with Israel to make that the case”. Israeli media cited Israeli officials as saying on Wednesday that Israel was preparing for retaliatory strikes on Iran “within days”, and that they would target “strategic sites”, including the country’s vital oil facilities. The officials also warned that Iran’s nuclear facilities would be hit if it made good on its threat to strike back at Israel. Senior Iranian officials have asserted that they consider their retaliation for the killing of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan to be over unless they are provoked further. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also said he had conveyed a message to the US through the Swiss embassy in Tehran warning it “not to intervene”. He cautioned: “Any third country that assists Israel or allows its airspace to be used against Iran will be considered a legitimate target.” The US has approximately 40,000 troops stationed in the Middle East, with many deployed in Iraq and Syria. These troops could be threatened by Iran-backed Shia militias in both countries. Iran must now brace itself for the Israeli response and hope its gamble pays off."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e82yy0wxno,Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for war,Giora Eiland tells Jeremy Bowen that Israel should tell Palestinians to leave northern Gaza before sealing it off as a way of pressuring Hamas.,2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:18.077102,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"On Saturday morning, a message was posted on social media by the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman warning people living in the ‘D5’ area of northern Gaza to move south. D5 is a square on the grid superimposed over maps of Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is a block that is split into several dozen smaller areas. The message, the latest in a series, said: ""The IDF is operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time. The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area."" A map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route. The message is not promising a swift return to the places people have been living in, an area that has been pulverised by a year of repeated Israeli attacks. The heart of the message is that the IDF will be using ""great force… for a long time"". In other words, don’t expect to come back any time soon. The humanitarian area designated by Israel in the message is al-Mawasi, previously an agricultural area on the coast near Rafah. It is overcrowded and no safer than many other parts of Gaza. BBC Verify has tracked at least 18 airstrikes on the area. Hamas has sent out its own messages to the 400,000 people left in northern Gaza, an area that was once the urban heartland of the Strip with a population of 1.4m.  Hamas is telling them not to move. The south, they are told, is just as dangerous. As well as that, Hamas is warning them that they will not be allowed back.  Many people appear to be staying put, despite Israeli airstrikes and artillery bombardments. When I went down to an area overlooking northern Gaza I could hear explosions and see columns of smoke rising. The intensity reminded me of the first months of the war. Some of the people who have stayed in northern Gaza when so many others have already fled south are doing so to remain with vulnerable relatives. Others are from families with connections to Hamas. Under the laws of war, that does not automatically make them belligerents. One tactic that has been used over the last year by civilians who want to avoid IDF operations without taking their chances in the overcrowded and dangerous south of Gaza is to move elsewhere in the north, for example from Beit Hanoun to Gaza City, while the IDF is operating near their homes or shelters. When the army moves on, they return. The IDF is trying to stop that happening, according to BBC colleagues who are in daily contact with Palestinians in Gaza. It is channelling families who are moving in one direction only, down Salah al-Din, the main road to the south. Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza to report the war, except for brief, rare and closely supervised trips with the IDF. Palestinian journalists who were there on 7 October still do brave work. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 128 Palestinian media workers in Gaza have been killed since the war began. In northern Gaza, since Israel went back on the offensive, they have been filming panic-stricken families as they flee, often with small children helping out by carrying oversized backpacks. One of them sent out a brief interview with a woman called Manar al-Bayar who was rushing down the street carrying a toddler. She was saying as she half-walked, half-ran on the way out of Jabalia refugee camp that ""they told us we had five minutes to leave the Fallujah school. Where do we go? In southern Gaza there are assassinations. In western Gaza they’re shelling people. Where do we go, oh God? God is our only chance.” The journey is hard. Sometimes, Palestinians in Gaza say, people on the move are fired on by the IDF. It insists that Israeli soldiers observe strict rules of engagement that respect international humanitarian law. But Medical Aid for Palestinians’ head of protection, Liz Allcock, says the evidence presented by wounded civilians suggest that they have been targeted. “When we’re receiving patients in hospitals, a large number of those women and children and people of, if you like, non-combatant age are receiving direct shots to the head, to the spine, to the limbs, very indicative of the direct targeted attack.” Once again, the UN and aid agencies who work in Gaza are saying that Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe. Desperate messages are being relayed from the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, saying that they are running low on fuel to power the generators that keep the hospitals going, and keep badly wounded patients alive. Some hospitals report that their buildings have been attacked by the Israelis. The suspicion among Palestinians, the UN and relief agencies is that the IDF is gradually adopting some or all of a new tactic to clear northern Gaza known as the ""Generals’ Plan"".  It was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by Maj-Gen (ret) Giora Eiland, who is a former national security adviser. Like most Israelis they are frustrated and angry that a year into the war Israel still has not achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The Generals’ Plan is a new idea that its instigators believe can, from Israel’s perspective, break the deadlock. At its heart is the idea that Israel can force the surrender of Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar by increasing the pressure on the entire population of the north. The first step is to order civilians to leave along evacuation corridors that will take them south of Wadi Gaza, an east-west stream that has become a dividing line in Gaza since the Israeli invasion last October. Giora Eiland believes Israel should have done a deal straight away to get the hostages back, even if it meant pulling out of Gaza entirely. A year later, other methods, he says, are necessary. In his office in central Israel, he laid out the heart of the plan. “Since we already encircled the northern part of Gaza in the past nine or 10 months, what we should do is the following thing to tell all the 300,000 residents [that the UN estimates is 400,000] who still live in the northern part of Gaza that they have to leave this area and they should be given 10 days to leave through safe corridors that Israel will provide. ""And after that time, all this area will become to be a military zone. And all the Hamas people will still, though, whether some of them are fighters, some of them are civilians… will have two choices either to surrender or to starve."" Eiland wants Israel to seal the areas once the evacuation corridors are closed. Anyone left behind would be treated as an enemy combatant. The area would be under siege, with the army blocking all supplies of food, water or other necessities of life from going in. He believes the pressure would become unbearable and what is left of Hamas would rapidly crumble, freeing the surviving hostages and giving Israel the victory it craves. The UN World Food Programme says that the current offensive in Gaza is having a ""disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families"". The main crossings into northern Gaza, it says, have been closed and no food aid has entered the strip since 1 October. Mobile kitchens and bakeries have been forced to stop work because of air strikes. The only functioning bakery in the north, which is supported by WFP, caught fire after it was hit by an explosive munition. The position in the south is almost as dire. It is not clear whether the IDF has adopted the Generals' Plan in part or in full, but the circumstantial evidence of what is being done in Gaza suggests it is at the very least a strong influence on the tactics being used against the population. The BBC submitted a list of questions to the IDF, which were not answered. The ultra-nationalist extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet want to replace Palestinians in northern Gaza with Jewish settlers. Among many statements he’s made on the subject, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “Our heroic fighters and soldiers are destroying the evil of Hamas, and we will occupy the Gaza Strip… to tell the truth, where there is no settlement, there is no security.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx254ydygjlo,Biden and Netanyahu speak as Israel mulls Iran response,It is believed to be the first time the two leaders have spoken directly in weeks.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:18.183597,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden has held a much-anticipated call with Israel's prime minister - believed to be their first dialogue in weeks. Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden are thought to have discussed Israel's response to Iran's missile attack last week amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The White House said US Vice-President Kamala Harris also joined the 30-minute call on Wednesday. Not long after the call wrapped up, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said its retaliatory attack against Iran would be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising"". ""They will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,"" Gallant said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described Biden and Netanyahu's conversation as ""direct and very productive"". She told reporters that discussions on the Iran attack continued and said that as long as Beirut's main airport remained open, the US would continue to make flights available for Americans still in Lebanon. Elsewhere in the Middle East region, fighting has continued between Hezbollah and Israel, with four people killed in an Israeli air strike on a Lebanese village near the southern city of Sidon. In the small Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, a couple out walking their dog were killed by Hezbollah rockets fired from Lebanon.  They are the first Israeli civilians to die since the cross-border conflict dramatically escalated 12 days ago. Rockets have also struck the Israeli port city of Haifa, injuring at least five people. Israel said it has carried out more than 1,100 air strikes since its ground invasion began in southern Lebanon on 30 September. In an update shared on Wednesday evening, the Israeli Air Force said it had used fighter jets, helicopters and remotely manned aircraft to attack Hezbollah's sites - and has also attacked 300 targets in northern Gaza as part of the fighting in Jabalia. Previously, Netanyahu has vowed Iran will ""pay the price"" for the Iranian barrage - which Tehran said was in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon and high-profile assassinations of Hezbollah leaders, including the late Hassan Nasrallah. The US has defended Israel's right to retaliate, but has also appeared to be trying to limit its response to Iran. Lebanon’s government says as many as 1.2 million people have fled their homes over the past year. Almost 180,000 people are in approved centres for the displaced. In addition, more than 400,000 people have fled into war-torn Syria, including more than 200,000 Syrian refugees - a situation that the head of the UN’s refugee agency described as one of “tragic absurdity”. Hezbollah - a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon - has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, including the killing of its leader and most of its top military commanders. On Monday, the group insisted it was “confident... in the ability of our resistance to oppose the Israeli aggression”. Israel’s government - which designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation - has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October 2023 - the day after its ally Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel."

Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency said the site in Nuseirat camp was struck by a volley of artillery on Sunday, killing entire families and wounding dozens more.  The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports.  Earlier, five children were reportedly killed by a drone strike while playing on a street corner in northern Gaza.  A civil defence spokesman said the attack on al-Mufti school, where hundreds of displaced people from around Gaza were sheltering, had injured at least 80 people and more than a dozen were killed. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said the school-turned-shelter was meant to be used to administer polio vaccines. Monday's rollout is the second stage in the UN's polio campaign in central Gaza, which is where most residents are now living and where the first case of polio in two decades was recently discovered in an unvaccinated baby. In a separate Israeli strike, four people were killed and dozens more injured at the al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza. Israel said it carried out a ""precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a command and control centre"" inside a site previously used as a hospital. The main areas of conflict in Gaza in recent days have been in the north, where Israeli forces have been intensifying attacks for over a week as part of a major ground operation. Hundreds have since been killed, Gazan authorities have reported.  Residents of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia and Beit Lahiya have reported being cut off from nearby Gaza City, while Israeli tanks have been seen on the outskirts of the territory's largest city.  Hospitals in the area are running out of supplies, although the World Health Organization said a joint operation with the Red Cross had resupplied two of them -after nine days of attempts. The five children in northern Gaza were reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike while playing on a street corner in al-Shati camp. Graphic images from the scene in the aftermath show the bloodied bodies of what appeared to be young teenage boys. One of them looked to be clutching several glass marbles in his hand. According to a report from the scene, told to a BBC correspondent, a drone strike hit a person walking down the street, which killed the children and injured seven other people. Later images showed the bodies of the five boys wrapped in white shrouds and laid out on the floor side-by-side. An aunt of one of the boys, named Rami, wrote a moving tribute to him on social media. She said the family had moved to al-Shati after being forced to leave their homes in Jabalia to a “safer area” because of the war. The IDF has not yet responded to questions about the incident. Over the last year of war, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported more than 42,000 people killed. In the past 24 hours, at least 62 people have died and 220 more injured following four Israeli strikes, it added. About 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war - many of whom have been forced to move multiple times to escape.  The fighting began after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year - killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage in Gaza."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v697l4q39o,What Israel's latest attacks tell us about Netanyahu's next move,A change in the political mood and a US election campaign means Israel senses change in the region.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:18.358177,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon is about to end its second week, as Israel’s war has already entered its second year. Appeals for a ceasefire have increased following an air strike in Beirut on Thursday night, and the wounding on Friday, for the second day running, of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon by Israeli military fire. A new offensive is taking place in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, despite persistent calls for the conflict there to end. Israel’s allies are also urging restraint as the country prepares to retaliate against Iran, following last week’s ballistic missile attack. However, Israel will continue to pursue its own path, and resist this pressure, because of three factors: 7 October, Benjamin Netanyahu and the United States. It was in January 2020 when Iranian general Qassem Soleimani landed at Baghdad airport on a night-time flight from Damascus. Soleimani was the head of Iran’s notorious Quds Force, an elite, clandestine unit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps specialising in overseas operations. The group – whose name means Jerusalem, and whose main adversary was Israel - was responsible for arming, training, funding and directing proxy forces abroad in Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and beyond. At the time, Soleimani was perhaps the second most powerful man in Iran, after the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As Soleimani’s convoy left the airport, it was destroyed by missiles fired from a drone that killed him instantly.  Although Israel provided intelligence to help locate its arch-adversary, the drone belonged to the United States. The assassination order had been given by then US President Donald Trump, not Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down,” former President Trump would later say in a speech referring to the Soleimani assassination. In a separate interview, Trump also suggested that he had expected Israel to play a more active role in the attack and complained that Netanyahu was “willing to fight Iran to the last American soldier”. While Trump’s account of events is disputed, at the time it was believed that Netanyahu, who praised the killing, was concerned that direct Israeli involvement could provoke a large-scale attack against Israel, either from Iran directly, or its proxies in Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories. Israel was fighting a shadow war with Iran, but each side was careful to keep the fighting within certain bounds, for fear of provoking the other into a larger-scale conflict. Just over four years later, in April of this year, the same Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israeli jets to bomb a building in the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing two Iranian generals amongst others. Then in July, the Israeli prime minister authorised the assassination of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s top military commander, in an air strike on Beirut. The response of the current US president was reportedly to swear at him, according to a new book by Bob Woodward, who claims that President Joe Biden was aghast that Israel’s prime minister was prepared to escalate a conflict the White House had been trying to bring to an end for months.  “You know, the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor,” President Biden is reported to have said. The same prime minister, characterised as being too cautious by one US president, was then castigated as being too aggressive by his successor.  What separates the two episodes is of course 7 October 2023 - the bloodiest day in the history of Israel and a political, military and intelligence failure of catastrophic proportions. What unites the two moments, however, is Netanyahu defying the will of a US president. Both factors help to explain the way Israel continues to prosecute the current war. Israel’s most recent wars concluded after a few weeks, once international pressure  built so much that the United States insisted on a ceasefire. The ferocity and scale of the Hamas attack against Israel,  the impact on Israeli society and its sense of security, mean that this war was always going to be unlike any recent conflict. For a US administration pouring billions of dollars’ worth of weapons into Israel, Palestinian civilian deaths and suffering in Gaza have been deeply uncomfortable, and politically damaging for the administration. For America’s critics in the region, the apparent impotence of the superpower when it comes to influencing the largest recipient of US aid is baffling.  Even after US jets were involved in repelling Iranian attacks on Israel in April - a clear sign of how Israel’s security is underwritten by its larger ally - Israel continued to bat away attempts to change the course of its war. This summer, Israel chose to escalate its conflict with Hezbollah, without seeking prior approval from the United States. As Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Netanyahu has learned from more than 20 years of experience that US pressure is something he can withstand, if not ignore. Netanyahu knows that the US, particularly in an election year, will not take action that forces him to divert from his chosen course (and believes, in any event, that he is fighting America’s enemies too). Especially when it comes to the latest escalation, it would be wrong to assume that Netanayhu is operating outside the Israeli political mainstream. If anything, the pressure on him is to be tougher to strike harder against Hezbollah, but also Iran.  When a ceasefire plan in Lebanon was mooted by the US and France last month, criticism of the proposed 21-day truce came from the opposition, and the main left-wing grouping in Israel, as well as the right-wing parties. Israel is determined to continue its wars now, not just because it feels it can withstand international pressure, but also because Israel’s tolerance of the threats it faces has shifted after 7 October.  Hezbollah has for years stated its aim to invade the Galilee in northern Israel. Now that the Israeli public has experienced the reality of gunmen infiltrating homes, that threat cannot be contained, it must be removed. Israel’s perception of risk has also changed. Long-held notions of military red lines in the region have evaporated. Several acts have been committed in the past year that could, until recently, have led to an all-out conflict, raining bombs and missiles on Tehran, Beirut, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Israel has assassinated the head of Hamas while he was a guest of the Iranians in Tehran; it has also killed the entire leadership of Hezbollah, including Hassan Nasrallah; it has assassinated senior Iranian officials inside diplomatic buildings in Syria.  Hezbollah has fired more than 9,000 missiles, rockets and drones at Israeli cities, including ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv. The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen have also launched large missiles at Israel’s cities, intercepted by Israeli defences as they re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere above central Israel. Iran has launched not one, but two attacks against Israel in the past six months involving more than 500 drones and missiles. Israel has invaded Lebanon. Any one of these might, in the past, have precipitated a regional war. The fact that they have not will change the way a normally cautious, risk-averse Israeli prime minister decides on his next move.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9jwkppnd1o,How Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalated to a ground invasion,A guide to recent developments in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:18.463632,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel says it has launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon against the armed group Hezbollah, marking another significant escalation of their long-running conflict that has heightened fears of a regional war. The Israeli military said troops were carrying out “limited” raids in villages near the border, as aircraft continued to conduct intense air strikes throughout Lebanon. It follows weeks of heavy blows by Israel against the Iran-backed Shia Islamist military and political organisation, including the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas who have been displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Although Hezbollah has been weakened, it remains defiant. The group is continuing to fire barrages of rockets into northern Israel and has said it is ready for the next battle. Here’s what we know about the latest developments. BBC Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega in Beirut says Lebanon woke up to the news that Israel had launched a ground operation in the south - something that felt almost inevitable in the last few days. The fear is that this could be the beginning of a wider campaign against Hezbollah, which fought a month-long war war with Israel in 2006. In a brief statement put out early on Tuesday, the Israeli military announced that troops backed by aircraft and artillery had begun “limited, localised and targeted raids against Hezbollah terror targets” in border villages, saying they posed an “immediate threat” to northern Israeli communities. According to BBC Middle East Correspondent Lucy Williamson in northern Israel, helicopters and jets flew low across this border overnight, to the regular crump of artillery and occasional loud explosions. And by the morning, fields a few miles from the border that had been full of dozens of tanks were emptying. The military did not say how many troops were involved or how far it was preparing to push into Lebanese territory. However, a senior security official told the BBC that this was “not numbers of a large ground invasion” and that the troops had so far only gone as far as “very close walking distance”. But sending ground troops even a short distance into Lebanon carries significant risks. Hezbollah, which is well armed with anti-tank missiles and mines, has been preparing to meet Israeli forces on that terrain for years. On Tuesday, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif denied that Israel troops had crossed into southern Lebanon and stated that there had been “no direct ground clashes”. But he added that the group was “ready for a direct confrontation with the enemy forces that dare or attempt to enter Lebanese territory and to inflict the greatest losses on them”. Hezbollah also fired more rockets and missiles into Israel - attacks that Mr Afif said were “only the beginning” of its response to Israel’s attacks. Sirens sounded several times in the border town of Metula, where Hezbollah said its fighters had targeted Israeli troops with artillery and rocket fire without mentioning any incursion. The group also claimed it had fired missiles towards two Israeli intelligence bases in the central Tel Aviv area. Paramedics said two people were injured on a highway near Kafr Qasim. Israel has inflicted huge damage on Hezbollah in recent weeks, killing more than a dozen top commanders and apparently destroying thousands of weapons in air strikes. It was also blamed for the exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks that left thousands of Hezbollah members maimed, blinded or killed.  However, BBC International Editor Jeremy Bowen says the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Friday is the biggest blow of all. For more than 30 years, he was the beating heart of Hezbollah. With the help of Iranian funding, training and weapons, he turned it into a military force whose attacks led Israel to end a 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 and which fought Israel to a standstill during a month-long war in 2006. For Israel, Nasrallah’s killing is a huge victory. In a defiant speech at the UN on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that Israel was “winning” the war against enemies who wanted to destroy it. By then, he had authorised the strike that killed Nasrallah. Prime Minister Najib Mikati warned on Tuesday that Lebanon was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases of its history"". He said about a million people - a fifth of the population - had fled their homes “because of the devastating war that Israel is waging on Lebanon”. The Lebanese health ministry said more than 1,200 people had also been killed, including dozens of children and women, over the past two weeks. Authorities are struggling to assist everyone, with shelters and hospitals under pressure. Israel says it is hitting Hezbollah sites, including weapons stores and ammunition dumps, and accused the group of using civilians as human shields. But BBC senior international correspondent Orla Guerin says that is disputed by residents of the central Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold that has been bombed repeatedly in the past week. The medical director of the local Rayaq hospital also told her that all of the casualties it had treated had been civilians. US President Joe Biden welcomed Hassan Nasrallah’s killing.  And after the Israeli incursion began, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin released a statement saying he agreed with Israel on the “necessity of dismantling [Hezbollah] attack infrastructure along the border”. However, Mr Austin also reiterated that “diplomatic resolution is required” to ensure the safety of civilians “on both sides of the border”. BBC state department correspondent Tom Bateman says the Israeli decision to escalate sharply the conflict with Hezbollah struck a potentially fatal blow to US President Joe Biden’s entire strategy of the last 11 months - to try to stop the war in Gaza engulfing the region. Biden has said he is boosting the US defensive posture in the Middle East, while the Pentagon has warned Iran-backed militias not to try to use this moment to attack US bases. Despite the earlier US attempts to rein in the Israeli leader and coax Hezbollah to a truce, Netanyahu has signalled strongly that he will act as he sees fit, whatever the pressure from Washington. Hezbollah still has thousands of fighters, many of them veterans of combat in neighbouring Syria’s civil war, as well as a substantial arsenal of missiles, many of them long-range, precision-guided missiles that could reach Tel Aviv and other cities. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says there will be pressure within its ranks to use those missiles before they get destroyed, but a mass attack on Israel that kills civilians could trigger a devastating response. The assassination of Nasrallah was also a huge blow to Iran, hitting at the heart of the regional network of allied, heavily armed militias known as the “Axis of Resistance” that is key to its deterrent strategy against Israel. On Sunday, Israeli jets struck infrastructure in Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hudaydah in response to recent missile and drone attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi movement. Iran could ask the Houthis and other groups to step up their attacks on both Israel and US bases in the region. But whatever response it chooses, it will likely calibrate it to be just short of triggering a regional war that would draw in the US and which it could not win."

D5 is a square on the grid superimposed over maps of Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is a block that is split into several dozen smaller areas. The message, the latest in a series, said: ""The IDF is operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time. The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area."" A map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route. The message is not promising a swift return to the places people have been living in, an area that has been pulverised by a year of repeated Israeli attacks. The heart of the message is that the IDF will be using ""great force… for a long time"". In other words, don’t expect to come back any time soon. The humanitarian area designated by Israel in the message is al-Mawasi, previously an agricultural area on the coast near Rafah. It is overcrowded and no safer than many other parts of Gaza. BBC Verify has tracked at least 18 airstrikes on the area. Hamas has sent out its own messages to the 400,000 people left in northern Gaza, an area that was once the urban heartland of the Strip with a population of 1.4m.  Hamas is telling them not to move. The south, they are told, is just as dangerous. As well as that, Hamas is warning them that they will not be allowed back.  Many people appear to be staying put, despite Israeli airstrikes and artillery bombardments. When I went down to an area overlooking northern Gaza I could hear explosions and see columns of smoke rising. The intensity reminded me of the first months of the war. Some of the people who have stayed in northern Gaza when so many others have already fled south are doing so to remain with vulnerable relatives. Others are from families with connections to Hamas. Under the laws of war, that does not automatically make them belligerents. One tactic that has been used over the last year by civilians who want to avoid IDF operations without taking their chances in the overcrowded and dangerous south of Gaza is to move elsewhere in the north, for example from Beit Hanoun to Gaza City, while the IDF is operating near their homes or shelters. When the army moves on, they return. The IDF is trying to stop that happening, according to BBC colleagues who are in daily contact with Palestinians in Gaza. It is channelling families who are moving in one direction only, down Salah al-Din, the main road to the south. Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza to report the war, except for brief, rare and closely supervised trips with the IDF. Palestinian journalists who were there on 7 October still do brave work. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 128 Palestinian media workers in Gaza have been killed since the war began. In northern Gaza, since Israel went back on the offensive, they have been filming panic-stricken families as they flee, often with small children helping out by carrying oversized backpacks. One of them sent out a brief interview with a woman called Manar al-Bayar who was rushing down the street carrying a toddler. She was saying as she half-walked, half-ran on the way out of Jabalia refugee camp that ""they told us we had five minutes to leave the Fallujah school. Where do we go? In southern Gaza there are assassinations. In western Gaza they’re shelling people. Where do we go, oh God? God is our only chance.” The journey is hard. Sometimes, Palestinians in Gaza say, people on the move are fired on by the IDF. It insists that Israeli soldiers observe strict rules of engagement that respect international humanitarian law. But Medical Aid for Palestinians’ head of protection, Liz Allcock, says the evidence presented by wounded civilians suggest that they have been targeted. “When we’re receiving patients in hospitals, a large number of those women and children and people of, if you like, non-combatant age are receiving direct shots to the head, to the spine, to the limbs, very indicative of the direct targeted attack.” Once again, the UN and aid agencies who work in Gaza are saying that Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe. Desperate messages are being relayed from the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, saying that they are running low on fuel to power the generators that keep the hospitals going, and keep badly wounded patients alive. Some hospitals report that their buildings have been attacked by the Israelis. The suspicion among Palestinians, the UN and relief agencies is that the IDF is gradually adopting some or all of a new tactic to clear northern Gaza known as the ""Generals’ Plan"".  It was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by Maj-Gen (ret) Giora Eiland, who is a former national security adviser. Like most Israelis they are frustrated and angry that a year into the war Israel still has not achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The Generals’ Plan is a new idea that its instigators believe can, from Israel’s perspective, break the deadlock. At its heart is the idea that Israel can force the surrender of Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar by increasing the pressure on the entire population of the north. The first step is to order civilians to leave along evacuation corridors that will take them south of Wadi Gaza, an east-west stream that has become a dividing line in Gaza since the Israeli invasion last October. Giora Eiland believes Israel should have done a deal straight away to get the hostages back, even if it meant pulling out of Gaza entirely. A year later, other methods, he says, are necessary. In his office in central Israel, he laid out the heart of the plan. “Since we already encircled the northern part of Gaza in the past nine or 10 months, what we should do is the following thing to tell all the 300,000 residents [that the UN estimates is 400,000] who still live in the northern part of Gaza that they have to leave this area and they should be given 10 days to leave through safe corridors that Israel will provide. ""And after that time, all this area will become to be a military zone. And all the Hamas people will still, though, whether some of them are fighters, some of them are civilians… will have two choices either to surrender or to starve."" Eiland wants Israel to seal the areas once the evacuation corridors are closed. Anyone left behind would be treated as an enemy combatant. The area would be under siege, with the army blocking all supplies of food, water or other necessities of life from going in. He believes the pressure would become unbearable and what is left of Hamas would rapidly crumble, freeing the surviving hostages and giving Israel the victory it craves. The UN World Food Programme says that the current offensive in Gaza is having a ""disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families"". The main crossings into northern Gaza, it says, have been closed and no food aid has entered the strip since 1 October. Mobile kitchens and bakeries have been forced to stop work because of air strikes. The only functioning bakery in the north, which is supported by WFP, caught fire after it was hit by an explosive munition. The position in the south is almost as dire. It is not clear whether the IDF has adopted the Generals' Plan in part or in full, but the circumstantial evidence of what is being done in Gaza suggests it is at the very least a strong influence on the tactics being used against the population. The BBC submitted a list of questions to the IDF, which were not answered. The ultra-nationalist extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet want to replace Palestinians in northern Gaza with Jewish settlers. Among many statements he’s made on the subject, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “Our heroic fighters and soldiers are destroying the evil of Hamas, and we will occupy the Gaza Strip… to tell the truth, where there is no settlement, there is no security.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9dz0p943zo,"Israeli strike kills 10 firefighters in south Lebanon, authorities say",Israel's military said it struck several Hezbollah operatives using a fire station as a military post.,6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:25.204072,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 10 firefighters were killed in an Israeli air strike in a border area in southern Lebanon on Sunday night, the Lebanese health ministry says. The firefighters had been “ready to go out on rescue missions” from a municipal building in Baraachit when it was struck, a ministry statement on Monday. The Israeli military told the BBC on Tuesday that it had conducted a ""precise"" strike on ""several Hezbollah terrorist operatives who were using a fire station as a military post during combat"". The military also said it carried out air strikes on 120 Hezbollah targets across the south in only hour on Monday afternoon, after Lebanese media reported intense Israeli bombardment across the region. The state-run National News Agency said Israeli aircraft hit more than 30 towns and villages around the southern coastal city of Tyre alone. The BBC’s Orla Guerin, who is in Tyre, said some of the locations hit were in the hills close to the border with Israel, but that at least one struck a built-up area of the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the targets of the strikes belonged to three regional units of Hezbollah’s Southern Front - the elite Radwan Force, the Missiles and Rockets Force, and the Intelligence Directorate.  The IDF also said it conducted a “targeted” strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where a thick plume of smoke was reported. The Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon also appeared to be expanding, with the IDF saying that a third division had joined the ground operation it launched six days ago to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure near the border. The IDF also ordered the evacuation of another 20 communities in the south, including the coastal town of Naqoura where the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon have their headquarters. Three weeks of intense Israeli strikes and other attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 1,400 people, including 22 on Sunday, and displaced another 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Hezbollah - a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon - has remained defiant despite suffering a series of devastating blows in recent weeks, including the killing of its leader and most of its top military commanders. On Monday, the group insisted it was “confident... in the ability of our resistance to oppose the Israeli aggression”. It came hours after Hezbollah rockets struck the northern Israeli port city of Haifa and the town of Tiberias, causing damage and nine injuries. Another 135 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel on Monday, according to the IDF. Police said a road was damaged in the Lower Galilee region between Haifa and Tiberias. Israel’s government - which designates Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation - has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of displaced residents to return to their homes near the Lebanese border after a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the Gaza war. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Monday that the “counterattack on our enemies in Iran's axis of evil is necessary for securing our future and ensuring our security”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp394rx53qro,Anger and grief in south Lebanon city almost deserted after Israeli strikes,The streets of Tyre are almost completely empty as people flee southern Lebanon for safer areas in the north.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:25.361036,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Conversations in Tyre in southern Lebanon happen in a hurry now.  It’s not wise to linger on the streets, and there are fewer and fewer people to talk to. Chats can be cut short by the rumble of Israeli bombing, or the sound of outgoing rocket fire by Hezbollah – which can attract incoming fire. Israeli drones buzz overhead. You drive fast, but don’t speed, knowing there are eyes in the sky. Mostly you are the only car on an empty road – which can make you a target. That knowledge is always with us, like the body armour we now wear. But civilians here have no armour plating to shield them, and many Lebanese no longer have a roof over their heads. More than one million have been forced to flee, according to the Prime Minister, Najib Mikati.  War has created a vacuum here – sucking the life out of this ancient city proud of its Roman ruins, and golden sandy beach. Streets are empty, and shops shuttered. The seashore is deserted. Windows rattle with Israeli air strikes. The local civil defence headquarters lies abandoned – rescue teams were forced to evacuate – to save themselves after they got a telephone warning from Israel. Israeli strikes are getting louder and closer to our hotel – in recent days several strikes on the hills opposite us appear to involve some of Israel’s most destructive bombs, weighing in at 1000lb. And then there is the Hezbollah factor. Even as the armed group is trying to hold off invading Israeli troops on Lebanese soil, it is controlling the international media in the city of Tyre. It limits our movements, though it has no control over what we write or broadcast. In hospitals, doctors look weary and overwhelmed. Many no longer go home because it is too dangerous to travel. Instead, they tend to patients like nine-year-old Mariam, whose left leg is in a cast, and whose arm is heavily bandaged. She lies sleeping in a bed in Hiram Hospital, dark hair framing her face. “She came in as part of a family of nine,” said Dr Salman Aidibi, the hospital CEO.   “Five of them were also treated. We operated on Mariam, and she is doing much better. We hope to send her home today. Most casualties are given first aid here and stabilised before being sent to other centres, because this hospital is on the front line.” He says the hospital receives about 30-35 injured women and children a day, and it is taking its toll on staff. “We need to be positive while we’re working,” he said. “It’s when we stop and contemplate, remember, that’s when we get emotional.” Asked about what may lie ahead his response comes with a sigh. “We are in a war,” he says. “A destructive war on Lebanon. We hope for peace, but we are prepared for all eventualities.” Also prepared for the worst is Hassan Manna. He’s staying put in Tyre as war tightens its grip. And he is staying open for business at the small coffee shop he has run for the past 14 years. Locals still pass by for a chat and some reassurance in the form of small plastic cups of sweet coffee. “I'm not leaving my country,” Hassan told me. “I'm not leaving my house. I’m staying in my place, with my children. I’m not afraid of them (the Israelis). ""The whole world is out on the streets. We don’t want to be humiliated like that.  ""Let me die in my house.” Five of his neighbours were killed in their home by an Israeli air strike last weekend. Hassan saw it happen and was thrown in the air by two incoming Israeli missiles. He managed to walk away with just an injured arm. Was there a Hezbollah target there? We don’t know. Hassan says the dead were all civilians and members of one family, including two women and a baby. Israel says its targets are Hezbollah fighters and their facilities, and not the people of Lebanon. Many here say otherwise – including doctors, and witnesses like Hassan. Israel says it is taking steps to minimise the risk of harming civilians – accusing Hezbollah of hiding its infrastructure among civilian populations.  “There was nothing (no weapons) there,” Hassan insisted. “If there was, we would have left the area. There was nothing to be bombed. The woman was 75.” After the strike he dug in the rubble for survivors until he collapsed and was taken to hospital himself. When he speaks of his neighbours his voice breaks with anger and grief - and his eyes fill with tears.  “It’s unjust,” he said, “totally unjust. We know the people. They were born here. I swear I wish I had died with them.” Ten days ago, we got the view in a Christian area, close to the border. One local woman – who asked not to be named - told me everyone was living on their nerves.  “The phone is constantly beeping,” she said. “We can never know when (Israeli) attacks are coming. It’s always tense. Many nights we can’t sleep.” We were interrupted by the sound of an Israeli air strike, which sent smoke rising from distant hills. She reeled off a list of villages nearer the border - now deserted and destroyed after the past year of tit for tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel. She said the damage in these areas was already far greater than in the five-week war of 2006. “If people want to come back later"", she said, “there are no houses left to come back to.   ""And there is no house that did not lose relatives,” she said, “either close or distant. All the men are Hezbollah.” Before the war the armed group was always “bragging about its weapons, and saying it would fight Israel forever,” she told me. “Privately, even their followers are now shocked at the quality and quantity of attacks by Israel.” Few here would dare to guess at the future. “We have entered a tunnel,” she said, “and until now we cannot see the light."" From Tel Aviv, to Tehran, to Washington no one can be sure what is coming next, and what the Middle East will look like the day after. Additional reporting by Mohamed Madi"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vplm00pm0o,Hospitals move patients as Israeli tanks encircle Jabalia camp,The Israeli military is carrying out its third ground offensive in the area since the Gaza war began.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:25.483879,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Amid gunfire and Israeli artillery shelling, Palestinian medics say that they have begun moving premature babies and other patients away from Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia refugee camp, as troops and tanks encircle it. The Israeli military has been carrying out its third ground offensive in the area since the war in Gaza began, saying it is targeting regrouping Hamas fighters who aim to launch attacks. Two other local hospitals are virtually inaccessible and face evacuation orders, Gazan health officials say. Dozens of people are reported to have been killed and wounded in the north in recent days. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said on Monday that its first responders had recovered the bodies of 15 people following an Israeli strike on a tented camp for displaced people next to the al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had ""struck terrorists operating within a command-and-control centre embedded in an area in Jabalia that previously served as a medical compound"", and that it had taken steps to mitigate harm to civilians. The Civil Defence also said five people were killed in a strike on a family home in the camp, which had more than 110,000 registered residents before the war. Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned that its own shelters and services were being forced to shut. “With almost no basic supplies available, hunger is spreading and deepening again,” Philippe Lazzarini said, adding that the second phase of the polio vaccination campaign for children in Gaza was also threatened. Residents have been speaking to the BBC about their fear and desperation. “I have been displaced more than 10 times. I’ve moved from house to house, from school to school, under shelling, and from street to street,” said Ahmed Leki, a 50-year-old father from the Falluja area of Jabalia. ""We are exhausted, completely worn out. There's nothing left. Where can we go? We have small children, and there's no safe place in Gaza, not a single safe inch,” he added. “We left our homes with shells raining down on us, with bombing, destruction, and dismemberment all around us. Enough is enough."" In recent days, new evacuation orders have been issued by the Israeli military covering a wide area in the north of the enclave, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and parts of Gaza City. All those remaining in the north - estimated at 400,000 people - have been told to head to the south. “Displacement is extremely difficult, a tragedy. There is no transportation, no necessities for survival. Men, women, and children ask, ‘Where do we go?’ and the answer is, ‘I don’t know,’” said Bilal al-Amreeti, a local man. “The sound of Israeli warplanes is above us, there is bombing, and the shelling continues everywhere.” Despite Israel’s assurances, many Gazans fear that it aims to depopulate the north of the strip and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy89v4g5285o,'It is important for us to raise a different voice',Two bereaved men - one Palestinian and one Israeli - on how 7 October attacks changed their lives.,7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:25.809564,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"For the past year London’s Palestinian and Israeli communities have been living with the fallout of a conflict thousands of miles away yet all too close to home.  On 7 October 2023 Hamas operatives from Gaza invaded Israel, killing more than 1,000 Israelis and taking around 250 hostage.  Israel has responded by bombing Gaza, leaving at least 41,000 Palestinians dead. As conflict escalates across the Middle East, I met two Londoners - one Israeli and one Palestinian -  who shared with me their grief and trauma and thoughts for the future, one year on. Magen Inon, 41, a lecturer lives in London with his family.  His parents were killed on 7 October at their home in a smallholding in Israel, close to the border with Gaza. ""My parents sent a message saying they can hear gunshots, that they are in the safe room. That was the last message we got from them."" His parents' home was burned down.  His father's death was confirmed soon after but not his mother's. ""We didn't have confirmation that my mum died until August. It took months.  ""My mum was supposedly the last missing person from October the 7th.  Since then he has dedicated his time trying to continue what he believes was his parents' legacy: to stop the war, call for the return of the hostages and call for humanitarian aid to go into Gaza. ""My parents, they raised us in a house that was always open to everyone. It didn't matter their group identity, their religion, their mother tongue... it was natural for us.""  But in the immediate aftermath of 7 October he and his four siblings felt some people were ""trying to hijack our pain in order to call for revenge and call for continuous violence"".  ""It was very important for us to raise a different voice."" He has been holding talks at universities with like-minded Palestinian counterparts where possible, calling for a ceasefire, an end to the war and to send humanitarian aid to Gaza.  Journalist Ahmed Alnaouq, 30, grew up in Gaza but came to the UK as a student five years ago.  He also lives in London, with his wife. He lost 21 close family members on 22 October when his family home was bombed. ""Israel dropped a bomb on my house, killing my father, my two brothers, my three sisters, my 14 nieces and nephews, and my cousin.  ""They were in Deir Al Balah in the south of the Gaza strip. It was designated a 'safe area' at the time by the Israelis."" Since then, he says, he has lost more relatives. ""I have lost so many family members. I am sincerely and genuinely telling you that I don't know how many family members I lost."" Ahmed runs We are Not Numbers, a youth-led Palestinian non-profit project which tells the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news.  He is also co-founder of Across The Wall with Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, a writing project started in the Gaza Strip in Hebrew and Arabic which, before this conflict, aimed to help Israelis understand the human stories behind what is happening behind the wall which separates Gaza and Israel. He still very much believes in peace, but adds ""right now it seems very dark, very bleak"".  ""The only hope I have, the only light at the end of the tunnel I can see, is the good people from all over the world who still care about the Palestinians."" Both of their lives have changed irrevocably since this time last year.  ""The problem is that it is not ending. It is ongoing. It is continuous and we don't know when it will end or if it will end,"" said Ahmed.  ""We have been living a series of horrors and trauma that I believe we will never heal from. Never.  ""I think the trauma we are living right now we will pass it to our children and grandchildren."" Magen says he often feels anxious when meeting Palestinians, but he knows that despite the divide, ""we're suffering from the same conflict"". He said: ""If you share the same values, you can move past that and actually become partners and I've had that experience a few times over the last year with quite a few Palestinian partners I'm working with.  He would like to continue to be a peacemaker. ""Once you start thinking about 'what's the world I want to create for my kids?  what's the future I want them to have?' rather than 'how do I avenge my loved ones' death?' which I think takes us in the wrong direction. ""It's much easier to find common ground."" Despite the  trauma of losing so many family members , Ahmed says the past cannot be changed. Instead he believes it is more important to focus on the future. ""We are all brothers and sisters, in humanity. What's happening in Gaza is a war against humanity. ""All of us should work together to end this... but also all wars everywhere."" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

In a statement on Saturday, Unifil said the peacekeeper was injured at its headquarters in the southern city of Naquora on Friday night amid ""ongoing military activity nearby"", though added that it did not know the origin of the fire. ""He underwent surgery at our Naqoura hospital to remove the bullet and is currently stable,"" it said. On Friday US President Joe Biden has said he was ""absolutely, positively"" urging Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers in Lebanon following two earlier incidents on Thursday and Friday. Israeli troops have launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon as part of its escalation against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it has been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis for the past year. Israeli forces have urged UN peacekeepers to leave their positions. A spokesperson for Unifil said on Saturday that there had been a ""unanimous decision"" to stay in the border region. Separately, Unifil said buildings at a position in the village of Ramyah sustained ""significant damage due to explosions from nearby shelling"" on Friday night. ""We remind all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and premises, including avoiding combat activities near Unifil positions,"" the mission said. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged that its troops were responsible for an incident in which two Sri Lankan soldiers, also in Naqoura, were injured.  The IDF said soldiers operating near the base opened fire after identifying a threat and that the incident would be investigated ""at the highest levels"". Sri Lanka's foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemned"" the attack.  On Thursday, two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured falling from an observation tower after Israeli tanks fired towards it.  Lt Gen Seán Clancy, chief of staff of the Irish Defence Forces, has said he does not believe the strike on Thursday was accidental. Some 340 Irish troops are currently operating in Lebanon with Unifil.  ""An observer tower with a round from a tank directly into it, which is a very small target, has to be very deliberate,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ.  ""So from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act. It's a direct act. ""Whether its indiscipline or directed, either way it is not conscionable or allowable."" The leaders of France, Italy, and Spain have also condemned Israel's actions, saying in a joint statement that they were unjustifiable and should immediately end.  On Saturday Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes on villages to the north and south of the capital Beirut had killed nine people. The IDF also told residents of 23 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali river. Hezbollah continued to fire into Israel, with the IDF saying that about 320 projectiles had been identified and a number of them intercepted. On Saturday, the IDF announced that the areas around the northern towns of Zar'it, Shomera, Shtula, Netu’a, and Eben Menachem would be closed to civilians from 20:00 local time (18:00 BST).  About 10,000 peacekeepers from 50 countries are stationed in Lebanon, alongside around 800 civilian staff. Since 1978, they have patrolled the area between the Litani River and the UN-recognised boundary between Lebanon and Israel, known as the ""Blue Line"". Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Over the past three weeks, Israel has dramatically escalated its campaign against Hezbollah, intensifying air strikes against southern Lebanon and southern parts of Beirut, assassinating Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and launching a ground invasion. Lebanon says more than 2,000 people have been killed, mainly in the recent escalation, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. This week Hezbollah rocket fire has killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai national, Israeli authorities say."

The Israeli military said it had killed 20 “terrorists” there over the past day, and that one of its soldiers had also been killed in the north.  Hamas said its fighters had targeted Israeli forces in Jabalia and its refugee camp, while the Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli strikes had killed 19 people. Civilians in Jabalia and nearby Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia have been told to evacuate south by the military, which said on Sunday that intelligence indicated Hamas was trying to “rebuild its operational capabilities” in the region. It warned that the operation would involve “systematic strikes and the radical destruction of terrorist structures”. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday evening that Israeli forces were besieging the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia and that it would run out of fuel within hours. It also said patients and medical personnel had been asked to evacuate the hospital, as well as the nearby Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals. Israeli forces launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken as hostages. More than 41,960 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry This is the third time Israeli forces have gone into Jabalia and its refugee camp over the past year, with the last operation in May displacing tens of thousands of people, killing hundreds and causing widespread destruction. On Monday, Jabalia resident Asmaa Tayeh told the BBC that she and her family had had to leave their home for the fourth time in a year. They have returned to her grandparents’ house in the al-Nasr district of Gaza City and, like many civilians in the north, are reluctant to move south, fearing that if they do they will not ever make it home. Despite Israeli assurances, Palestinians fear the military is planning to implement a plan, proposed by the former head of Israel’s national security council, to completely empty northern Gaza of the 300,000 to 500,000 civilians believed to be living there. According to Giora Eiland’s plan, the north would then be declared a “closed military zone” and the estimated 5,000 Hamas fighters there would be put under siege in order to force the group to release the remaining Israeli hostages. “The situation is getting so dangerous that we don’t have so much hope that we’ll go back,” Asmaa said. The Israeli military also ordered civilians in parts of the southern city of Khan Younis to evacuate after Hamas fired rockets towards Israel from there on Monday, lightly wounding two women in Kfar Chabad in central Israel. In central Gaza, the civil defence agency said 17 people, including children, were killed when a three-storey home in Bureij refugee camp was hit in an Israeli strike overnight.  Medics at a hospital in nearby Nuseirat refugee camp confirmed the death toll, according to AFP news agency. The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas operatives in the camp and that it “conducted a precise strike on a structure from which a terrorist cell planned terror activities”.

On Thursday, two UN peacekeepers from Indonesia were wounded falling from an observation tower in Naqoura after an Israeli tank fired towards it. Two other peacekeepers were injured in a separate explosion which the Israeli military (IDF) has said it is investigating.  Last week, the Israeli military asked the UN to prepare to pull back from the border - something Unifil (the United Nations Interim Force) has refused to do. IDF Spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said the military was in an ""ongoing conflict with Hezbollah whose terrorists and infrastructure are in close proximity to Unifil positions posing a significant risk to the safety of peacekeepers"". ""The IDF takes every precaution to minimize harm to civilians and peacekeepers alike,"" he added. UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres said firing on peacekeepers was a “violation of international humanitarian law”. ""These peacekeepers must be protected,"" he said. Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for Unifil, said recent attacks on UN bases look like ""more of a deliberate attack against our troops, who have been in the south to try to bring back stability"". Asked about the attacks, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was ""vital that peacekeepers and civilians are protected” and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire. ""As you know we continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to suffering and bloodshed. It is a reminder of the importance of us all renewing our diplomatic efforts to resolve this."" Asked if the prime minister would agree with Ireland's Taoiseach (Irish PM) that Israel had broken international law, the spokesperson says: ""All parties must always do everything possible to protect civilians and comply with international law."" Unifil was set up in March 1978 to monitor the area after Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon - a response to cross-border attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation.   Indonesia currently contributes the largest number of personnel to the force, followed by India, Ghana, Nepal and Italy. Since its creation, more than 300 Unifil peacekeepers have been killed."

Fouad Siniora said it was unacceptable to leave Lebanon to fall, and there was a lack of initiative when it came to trying to restore peace. ""We are now in a very difficult situation that requires real effort locally, as well on the Arab side and internationally.  ""You can push things - sometimes to the brink of falling - in a major catastrophe without really realising what it means later on. ""It's happening at a time when the American administration is so busy with the elections.  ""And we are unable to elect a president, because some groups in the country, particularly Hezbollah, have been insisting that they want a president that will not stab that group in the back,"" Siniora said. The last war between Lebanon and Israel, nearly 20 years ago, began when Hezbollah fighters crossed the border and attacked Israeli soldiers. Two were kidnapped and three were killed, sparking a month-long conflict. In the days that followed, Siniora made a public statement distancing the Lebanese government from what had happened.  He thinks the country’s current leaders have failed their people by not doing the same thing. ""This government did not do what my government did that day. My government was very clear and determined in stating that we were not aware, and we were not informed, of Hezbollah’s plan to cross the Blue Line on the border and to kidnap and kill Israeli soldiers.  ""This time there hasn't been any move made by the Lebanese government. The advantage of what we did is that we created a distance between the Lebanese government and Lebanon on the one hand, and Hezbollah on the other,"" he explained. Siniora is unflinching in his assessment of Lebanon’s lost sovereignty.  ""Practically, Lebanon as a state has been kidnapped by Hezbollah. And behind Hezbollah is Iran.  ""This gun that was held by Hezbollah, instead of being pointed towards Israel, started to be pointed domestically and started to be used as a way for Iran to interfere in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen. Lebanon can’t get involved in such a war."" Siniora was also one of the architects of UN resolution 1701, the agreement which ended the 2006 war.  Among its conditions was that a swathe of southern Lebanon - the area south of the landmark Litani river - should be kept as a buffer zone between the two sides, free of any Hezbollah fighters or weapons.  Despite the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force Unifil and the presence of the Lebanese army, that didn’t happen. Hezbollah’s people, and its military infrastructure, remained bedded into the area. This vacuum at the top of the Lebanese political system has made Hezbollah’s influence on the country particularly difficult to control.  Lebanon has been without a properly functioning government since its last set of elections in 2022, being run instead by a caretaker administration.  When President Michel Aoun’s term ended nearly two years ago, lawmakers couldn’t agree on his replacement - so the job remains empty. Many Lebanese believe leadership is in short supply. Siniora is also clear that the conflict in Lebanon should not be inextricably linked to the current year-old war in Gaza.  Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has visited regional capitals, calling for simultaneous ceasefires in both Lebanon and Gaza. “Since October 2023 things have been dragging and getting worse and worse. Many chances were made available to dissociate the Lebanese situation from Gaza. It’s very important nationally and from an Arab point of view to associate with Gaza,"" Siniora said. ""But particularly now Lebanon cannot afford, in principle, to get involved in such a matter.  ""When the Gaza situation has become 2.2 million Palestinians homeless and all of Gaza destroyed, to continue to link Lebanon's situation with Gaza is not wise."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vp7dg3ml1o,Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Where is fighting happening in Lebanon?,A visual guide to the latest developments in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.,6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:36.001136,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has invaded southern Lebanon in a dramatic escalation of its conflict with Hezbollah. The Israeli ground operation began on 30 September, days after an air strike killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed armed group. Hezbollah has fired rockets into northern Israel as Lebanon has endured three weeks of aerial bombardment that Lebanese authorities say has killed more than 1,000 people and forced up to a million to flee their homes. Israel has a decades-long history of conflict with Hezbollah but the war in Gaza has sparked a year of deadly cross-border fighting between them. We will be continually updating maps in this page to help explain the conflict. Lebanon is a small country with a population of about 5.5 million people, which borders Syria to the north and east, Israel to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. It is about 170km (105 miles) away from Cyprus. Israeli troops and tanks that had gathered close to the border crossed into Lebanon on 1 October. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it is carrying out ""limited, localised, and targeted ground raids"" in southern Lebanon to dismantle what it calls Hezbollah's “terrorist infrastructure”. Israeli troops are fighting directly with Hezbollah fighters on the ground. Several Israeli soldiers have been killed in mortar attacks and ambushes by Hezbollah during operations in southern Lebanon aimed at “eliminating terrorists”, according to the IDF. Hezbollah said its fighters had clashed with Israeli forces in Adaisseh, Kafr Kila, Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun - all Lebanese villages close to the border with Israel. A ground operation in southern Lebanon comes with many risks for Israeli forces. Unlike the flat coastal plains of Gaza, southern Lebanon has rolling hills and some mountainous terrain that makes it difficult for tanks to move easily without fear of being ambushed. Hezbollah is also thought to have a network of tunnels in the region, with the group having been preparing for another full-scale conflict with Israel since the 34-day war in 2006. As part of its invasion of southern Lebanon, the IDF has ordered people living in some villages to evacuate, telling those remaining to leave their homes and ""immediately head to the north of the Awali River"" – which meets the coast about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Israel.  At first the evacuation orders were concentrated in the south east of Lebanon, but in recent days more have been been issued for villages in the south west, perhaps indicating that Israeli operations are about to extend to that part of the border. Lebanese civilians have also been warned by the IDF not to use vehicles to travel south across the Litani River, located about 30km (20 miles) north of the border. About a million people lived in southern Lebanon before the conflict escalated almost a year ago.  Tens of thousands have been fleeing north since Israeli air strikes in the region intensified in late September. The main route for civilians trying to leave the south is the coastal road that runs the length of the country - but areas along that route have been hit by air strikes. Israel’s invasion of southern Lebanon came after nearly two weeks of intense air strikes that Israel's military says target Hezbollah in the south of the country, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the southern suburbs of Beirut. Israel says it is hitting Hezbollah sites, including weapons stores and ammunition dumps, but Lebanese officials say more than 100 women and children have been killed. The majority of the rockets recently fired by Hezbollah have targeted northern areas of Israel. But some rockets have reached further south and damaged homes near the coastal city of Haifa. There has been almost a year of cross-border hostilities between Israel's forces and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets at northern Israel during that time, forcing some Israelis living there to flee south, while the IDF has launched air strikes and artillery fire against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon.  As the chart below shows, the number of weekly Israeli attacks on Lebanon more than tripled in the week before the IDF launched its ground invasion. The number of Hezbollah attacks, while small in comparison, also increased in the same week.  Israel has intensified strikes on Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, in recent days.  The majority of the strikes have hit the southern suburbs of the city, densely populated areas that are home to thousands of civilians.  These areas, close to the international airport, also have a strong Hezbollah presence and a series of Israeli strikes on buildings there killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah on 27 September.  There have also been Israeli aerial attacks on locations closer to the centre of the city. A strike on an apartment block close to the Lebanese parliament building on 2 October killed several people, including rescue officers and paramedics, according to Beirut's civil defence. The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which areas have sustained concentrated damage - including Dahieh in Beirut and areas along the border with Israel. Israel is now engaged in hostilities with armed forces and non-state armed groups in several countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Syria and Iran-backed groups operating in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel on Tuesday was the latest major escalation. What happens next is unclear, but Israel has vowed to respond, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing the attack as ""a big mistake"" that Iran ""will pay for""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5wdezxe7o,"Bowen: Iran wanted to do real damage, and Israel's response may not be as restrained as last time","Iran last attacked Israel back in April, but this time the Israeli response could be very different.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:36.140917,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"When Iran attacked Israel in April, it seemed like it was making a point – but Iran effectively gave notice of the attack in terms of how it carried it out, and everything was pretty much shot out of the air by Israeli and American defences. This time around it’s different. The Iranians looked like they wanted to do some serious damage and were making a much more aggressive point. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps put out an announcement saying that they were retaliating to the killings of senior leaders in Hamas and Hezbollah, and warned that if Israel retaliated, in turn they would strike back. Last time around, Joe Biden said to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu – “Take the win”, don’t carry out a big response - and they didn’t. This time around in Israel the mood is very different. Look at the tweet from former prime minister Naftali Bennett last night, using very strong language, saying: “This is the greatest opportunity in 50 years to change the face of the Middle East.” He was arguing that Israel should go after Iran’s nuclear facilities, in order to “fatally cripple this terrorist regime”. Now he’s not prime minister (although he is widely tipped to be a future one, so he was making a point to show he is tough) but it does reflect a certain mood in the country. I would not rule out attacks by Israel on anything at the moment – nuclear sites, petrochemical facilities, anything that could cause damage to the Iranian economy. The scenario always was that Iran had a forward defence in the shape of Hezbollah in Lebanon, with a massive arsenal of sophisticated weapons, to be used, in theory, if Iran and its nuclear facilities were attacked. But in the last couple of weeks, Israel has decapitated the Hezbollah organisation, destroyed half of its weapons, according to American and Israeli authorities; and invaded Lebanon. The deterrent Iran had, you could argue, is not just gone – it’s smashed into a thousand pieces. So I think the Israelis are feeling more free to act. And Joe Biden is moving another carrier battle group to the Mediterranean, signalling to the Iranians that if you hit Israel, you hit the US too. This is why people were talking about the fear of the war spreading: the instability, the turbulence that comes from everything that’s been happening – now we are seeing it play out and it leaves very little room for diplomacy at this moment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3618lnj2ygo,Starmer reflects on 'sorrow and grief' one year after Hamas attack,"The prime minister called for the ""immediate and unconditional"" release of hostages still being held inside Gaza.",7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:36.281594,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Sir Keir Starmer marked ""a day of sorrow and grief"" one year on from the 7 October attacks on Israel, as he called for the ""immediate and unconditional"" release of hostages still being held in Gaza. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister praised the ""dignity and determination"" of the families of those taken captive by Hamas. He said of them: ""Their pain is as acute today as it was a year ago. They live it every day."" Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostages when the group launched a surprise assault on communities in southern Israel. A British-Israeli woman is among 97 hostages still unaccounted for. Sir Keir described the 7 October attacks as being ""born of hatred"" and ""targeted not just at individuals, but at Jewish communities, at their way of life and at the state of Israel, the symbol of Jewish security to the world"". He paid tribute to 15 British citizens killed in the initial raids, and another who has since died in captivity.  A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for. Among them is Mandy Damari, a 28-year-old British-Israeli woman. Earlier on Monday, her mother Mandy described the ""living hell"" of not knowing her daughter's fate, and called on the British government to do more to secure the release of hostages. She told an event in London: “How is it that she is still imprisoned there after one year?  ""Why isn't the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release? She's one of their own."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy attended the same event. He said: ""It is a day of deep reflection and pain thinking about 7 October, the worst attack on the Jewish community since the Holocaust."" The 7 October attacks led to the Israeli government launching an invasion into Gaza in an attempt to free the hostages and dismantle Hamas. In the months that followed, hate crime against Jews and Muslims in the UK rose amid protests and enflamed community tensions. During his Commons statement on Monday, Sir Keir said his government would ""stand with all communities here in the UK, against hatred of Jews and Muslims"". The prime minister reflected on victims in the conflict which has broken out in the Middle East in the aftermath of the attack. Israeli assaults on Gaza have killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians and war has spread to Israel's northern border with Lebanon. The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and European Union - began almost daily rocket attacks against Israel in support of Hamas shortly after the 7 October attacks. Hundreds of people have died in Lebanon in recent days in Israeli bombardments. The prime minister said: ""Nobody in this House can truly imagine what it feels like to cower under the bodies of your friends, hoping a terrorist won't find you minutes after dancing at a music festival. ""No one can truly imagine seeing your city, your homes, your hospital, your businesses obliterated, with your neighbours and family buried underneath. ""It is beyond our comprehension - and with that should come humility."" Sir Keir said the government would continue to push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and a long-term diplomatic solution which provides security to Israel, alongside side a Palestinian state."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylzx1xz2yo,What might happen next with conflict in the Middle East? 10 experts share their analysis,"A group of experts on whether the map of the region is being redrawn, what comes next, and what can help avert all-out war",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:36.502438,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"On 1 October, Israel began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Shortly afterwards, Iran launched more than 180 missiles towards Israel. With the war in Gaza still ongoing, fears of an all-out regional conflict in the Middle East remain high. How big a danger is this threat of further escalation? For BBC InDepth, we asked a range of experts to share their analysis of why the conflict has escalated, and what might happen next. Israel seems to have upgraded its goals from weakening Hezbollah to enforce a ceasefire deal that secures Israel’s north, to seeking to neutralise Hezbollah permanently. Despite inflicting huge losses on Hezbollah, Israel’s military campaign won’t make Hezbollah disappear. It’s hard to know the difference between government rhetoric and what it will do on the ground. What they say they’re doing is removing the threat of Hezbollah to protect civilians in Northern Israel who live in sovereign territory and need to return after being displaced for a year as a result of ongoing rocket fire from Hezbollah, who joined the fight with Hamas after October 7. But this government also has religious forces setting forth, not a strategy, but a cosmic vision of conquest. And therefore we can’t rule out that there may be an expansionist ethos. Israel would like the Lebanese state to reassert authority over Hezbollah. This reminds me of the 1982 Israeli ground war in Lebanon against the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. That didn’t turn out so well in the long-term for Israeli citizens living near the Lebanese border. Israel in this case will need to focus on the short-term gain of calming the situation enough that its displaced 60,000 residents of northern Israel can return to their homes. The balance of power in the Middle East is beginning to shift in a way that is weakening Iran’s influence in the region. But any such change in the status quo is a process that will take a long time to materialise. It’s too soon to reach that conclusion, but what’s certain is the Iran-led axis is reeling and Israel seems to have achieved some significant tactical gains. Whether it can translate those to strategic gains through diplomacy remains to be seen. Not the map, but the power balance for sure. For the past 20 years, Iran and its proxies (Hamas and Hezbollah) on one side and Israel on the other have held each other to a draw, meaning there was mutual deterrence. That was shattered on 7 October, and Israel is trying to get the upper hand. It’s too soon to tell. My feeling is, talk to me in two weeks or talk to me in a year and we will know if there’s been a re-occupation of Southern Lebanon… At the same time, you have the conflict with Iran, but I don’t think they’re trying to redraw the borders in the Middle East. The fact that Iran has clearly lost Hamas and Hezbollah as effective deterrents means that an increasing number of figures in the Iranian establishment are going to want to develop a nuclear weapon. However, what does this mean in practice? And when will Israel find out? Israeli intelligence is pretty good in Iran - if Iran does start building a weapon, will Israel find out next week? If Iran goes ahead with this, it enters a very risky area. But as things stand, Iran’s conventional military capabilities are a joke compared to Israel’s, so it has relied on non-traditional means such as militias - which have proved to be of little use. The nuclear ambition in Iran is a concern for Israel for obvious reasons. Anti-Israel animus remains central to the regime. For Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the project to destroy Israel is the oldest and most central demand. It’s the only project he’s been able to advance towards, and the only thing the Islamic Republic is a leader in is the anti-Israel project - it’s the only state in the world that shoots at Israel. However, there is a more pragmatic element within the Iranian political establishment, which often gets forgotten, and which believes Iran has no business fighting the Palestinian war for the Palestinians. Iran will do whatever it takes to secure its nuclear programme. It will perceive an Israeli attack on its nuclear programme as an existential threat. It may be that in the Iranian perception, the only thing they’ve got left that could potentially genuinely be a game-changer, is to go nuclear. I don’t know what exactly that might mean – maybe they have a capability already, and they could demonstrate it by conducting a nuclear test in the desert somewhere. Israel’s widening campaign is sowing increasing anger among the populations in the Middle East who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. This makes achieving peace in the future harder. Certainly, a larger war will spread Israel thin, especially when it has yet to achieve the eradication of Hamas in Gaza. However, Israel continues to have the military support of the United States. Israel has been fighting in Gaza for a year and there has been major destruction of Hamas brigades and a severe loss of fighters. The biggest problem for achieving its aims in Gaza is that Israel has no vision for an alternative governing force. The problem isn’t that Israeli forces are being spread thin, but that Israel needs a political strategy for a government framework that leads to Palestinian self-determination and has international and Palestinian buy-in. Without that, Gaza will be a constant threat and a constant military drain. Israel cannot achieve its aims in Gaza because it doesn’t have a political aim – it never did, and it went to war without one. And this will potentially be its Achilles’ heel. But Netanyahu probably doesn’t feel like he needs to seek any kind of political outcome because he can go to endless war, and yet still have much of the Western world on his side. Any American president can exert influence on Benjamin Netanyahu if he or she wants to. But none of them have thought it beneficial. Kamala Harris has less long-term baggage than Joe Biden in terms of wanting to give unconditional levels of support to Israel, but her party is internally divided - on one side there is strong support for Israel and on the other side, some are calling for an arms embargo. Those are a minority, but the Democratic voices calling to constrain Israel somehow are growing significantly. Trump is a wildcard. He talks big, but he doesn’t like America being dragged into wars. I think Donald Trump might exert more influence than Kamala Harris. He is more pro-Netanyahu, or at least pro-right-wing Israel, but he’s very much against dragging the US into war. Any US administration that is providing $10bn (£7.6bn) to help Israel’s military operations will have leverage, especially as Israel’s economy is suffering. The question is whether there is any US politician in a position of real authority who is willing to absorb the political cost domestically of using that leverage. At present there is not in either party. There is no Ronald Reagan or George HW Bush in prospect. They’re harder to pinpoint with every missile fired or air strike launched. I am very pessimistic about the prospects of de-escalation… most likely the perception within the Israel Defence Forces and at the political level within Netanayhu's war cabinet is that they have the momentum. In warfare, when one side believes it has the momentum against its adversary, you don't want to give it up, because you can continue to put pressure on your enemy. This conflict will not be won militarily by any actor involved. Ultimately, diplomacy is the only way towards stability. There are two obvious off-ramps. The first is for Israel to accept a ceasefire in Gaza that will pull back forces to agreed locations so that humanitarian aid can move and that allows for a new Palestinian governing authority that Palestinians, not Israelis or Americans, will choose. The second is for a ceasefire in Lebanon that will see Hezbollah cease rocket/missile attacks on Israel in return for Israel halting its airstrikes and ground incursions. I don’t think Netanyahu is looking for off-ramps. But the one potential off-ramp is if there were major concessions from Iran, a major turnaround in Iranian policy, starting with the nuclear programme but including the support for Hezbollah and Hamas. I can’t imagine it happening, but that would be an off-ramp. In Lebanon, the off-ramp is for a ceasefire and an agreement on new security arrangements in the south. I don’t think this option is available before the end of this year and while we’re awaiting a new US administration. There are no off-ramps here unless the US and other major Western governments make it their business to change the direction of events on the ground in the Middle East.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70w95kzljjo,Events held marking one year since start of latest Middle East conflict,"Thousands attended a pro-Palestinian rally in Edinburgh, while a vigil for victims of Hamas attacks will take place on Sunday.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:36.615151,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Events are being held across Scotland this weekend as the one-year anniversary of the latest Middle East conflict draws near.  Thousands attended a pro-Palestinian rally in Edinburgh, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and to highlight the human cost of Israel's response to the 7 October attacks by Hamas. Smaller demonstrations also took place in Aberdeen and Inverness. A vigil to remember the victims of the Hamas attacks on Israel will be held in Glasgow on Sunday. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed at least 41,825 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Violence has spread to Lebanon in recent weeks. Thousands of pro-Palestinian supporters marched from the foot of The Mound through Edinburgh city centre waving the flags of both Palestine and Lebanon. Organisers, Stop the War Coalition, are calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East and an end to Britain supplying arms to Israel. One of those attending the demonstration was Majdi Awwad from Tulkarm in the West Bank who is now living in Edinburgh. He said a year into the conflict, he feels ""more hope"" in part due to the public's awareness of events. He said: ""All of the people who are attending the rally get to understand what is happening. ""Not everybody has to be a part of the story, but as long as they have in their conscience and the knowledge about what is happening it will be much better."" Omar Afzal, who travelled from Glasgow to attend the event, said he was worried that the war was spreading more widely across the Middle East.  ""It’s still deeply concerning and truth be told we don’t see much light at the end of the tunnel at this point in time,"" he said. The First Minister John Swinney has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to UK arms being exported to Israel.  Sir Keir Starmer said a ""ceasefire that lasts"" must ""happen now"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict while speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in February. Earlier this week, the defence secretary, John Healey, said UK forces were involved in supporting Israel after Iran launched ballistic missiles at the country. The last week has seen a significant escalation of the crisis in the Middle East, with warnings that it could develop into an all-out regional war. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. The prime minister has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"", following a further escalation in the region."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wkxv9d99vo,Antisemitic incidents in US surge to record high - report,"The Anti-Defamation League identified 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the year after the 7 October attacks.",8 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:36.737956,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Reports of antisemitic incidents in the US have reached a record high since last year's Hamas attack in Israel, according to a preliminary report from the Anti-Defamation League Center for Extremism (ADL). The group found more than 10,000 incidents from 7 October 2023 to 24 September of this year, more than a 200% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.  It is the highest ever since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979.  The report comes just days after the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement warning of possible violent threats amid the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East.  Since last October’s Hamas attack on Israel which saw around 1,200 people killed ""Jewish Americans haven’t had a single moment of respite,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.  “Instead, we’ve faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.” The more than 10,000 episodes of antisemitism reported by the ADL included roughly 8,015 incidents of verbal or written harassment, 1,840 incidents of vandalism and 150 incidents of physical assault. The states with the highest number of recorded cases in the report were California, with 1,266 incidents, New York with 1,218, New Jersey with 830, and Florida with 463.  The ADL said that it expected its preliminary numbers to increase as it receives more data. The final report for 2024 will be published in the spring of 2025. Part of the overall increase comes from a change in methodology to include ""expressions of opposition to Zionism, as well as support for resistance against Israel or Zionists that could be perceived as supporting terrorism"", the ADL said.  The ADL's preliminary report tallied more than 3,000 of incidents that took place during anti-Israel rallies ""which featured regular explicit expressions of support for terrorist groups"", including Hamas and Hezbollah.  Excluding these incidents, the ADL counted 7,523 episodes of antisemitism, a 103% increase from 2022.  Following the 7 October attack, Israel launched a massive military operation in the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.  Since then, 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and more than 97,000 injured in Gaza, most of them women and children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.  The war inspired a wave of demonstrations across the US, particularly at college campuses, with many protesting against the growing humanitarian toll.  In Lebanon, more than 1,000 people have been killed while up to a million people may have been displaced since Israel launched its attack against Iran-backed Hezbollah.  The continued violence in the region has led to a surge in anti-Muslim and Islamophobic incidents as well across the US.  Anti-Muslim incidents reached 8,061 in 2023, according to a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released in April. The report marked the highest level since CAIR began tallying nearly 30 years ago, with nearly half coming after the 7 October attack. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c243zempn6zo,Netanyahu in poll rebound after Hezbollah attacks,"The Israeli PM's party would win the most seats if an election were held but the opposition bloc would have more overall, a poll shows.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:36.869311,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s popularity, which was battered after the Hamas attacks on 7 October, has been boosted by his country’s military successes against Hezbollah, a new opinion poll suggests. A picture has been widely shared of the Israeli PM in New York giving the order for the biggest of these - the assassination of the Lebanese armed group’s long-time chief, Hassan Nasrallah. A poll for Israel’s Channel 12, released on Sunday night, indicates the Israeli PM's Likud party would win more seats than any other if a general election was held. However, it did not project a win for him overall, instead suggesting the current opposition parties would have more MPs, enabling them to form a coalition. Fortunately for Netanyahu, his former political rival, Gideon Saar, also joined his fractious coalition government on Sunday, a step that should strengthen the prime minister. “We will work together, shoulder to shoulder, and I intend to seek his assistance in the forums that influence the conduct of the war,” Netanyahu said. Saar will serve as a minister without portfolio with a seat in the Security Cabinet, the body overseeing the management of the war against Israel’s regional enemies. By joining the government with his four-seat party, Netanyahu has a much more solid majority of 68 in the 120-seat parliament. Rumours had swirled in recent weeks that the position of defence minister currently held by the popular, seasoned, former military general Yoav Gallant would go to the relatively less experienced Saar. However, that move seemed to be abandoned as Israel began its series of major strikes against Hezbollah. For Netanyahu, the new composition of the government weakens the power of his National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. The far-right winger has repeatedly threatened to topple the coalition if it goes ahead with a “reckless” deal to end the war in Gaza and bring home hostages or agrees to a permanent ceasefire with Hezbollah. The coalition could now survive without Ben Gvir’s Jewish Power party’s six seats, giving Netanyahu more room for manoeuvre. Once seen as a rising star of Likud, Saar left the party and became one of the most vocal critics of the prime minister arguing that Netanyahu should not continue to serve while battling corruption charges.  He has framed his decision to join the government as an act of patriotism, fostering unity. However, he has been sharply criticised by some Israeli commentators who describe him as acting cynically in his own self-interest. “Saar’s decision to join the government is certainly a painful blow to a large number of Israelis who think that Netanyahu needs to go, and not just because he is being tried on criminal charges, and not just because he is the most corrupt, hedonistic and lying prime minister Israel has ever had,” said Yedioth Ahronoth columnist, Sima Kadmon. She sees that his action “will stabilise and boost the worst government ever to have served in Israel, so much so that the original date of the next elections, October 2026, now appears to be a realistic date"". Certainly, the extra seats could also help solve another challenge facing Israel’s most far-right ever government.  At this sensitive time of war, when the military has a pressing need to expand its ranks, divisions have opened over the passage of a new military conscription law. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled in June that the state must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students into the army. They have historically been exempted, and such a move is vehemently opposed by two ultra-Orthodox parties upon which the coalition depends. Deepening his personal rift with the prime minister, in July, Yoav Gallant approved a plan to begin sending out draft notices to 1,000 18-26-year-olds from the ultra-Orthodox community. A slick political strategist, Netanyahu - Israel’s longest serving leader - did see a big drop in the support for his party in polls at the end of last year. His personal image as “Mr Security” was badly damaged after the 7 October attacks - the deadliest day in Israeli history, when Hamas surprised one of the world’s best intelligence services and the best resourced military in the region took hours to respond. However, by August, opinion polls suggested the prime minister had begun to bounce back. That was despite the invasion of Gaza turning into Israel’s longest ever war with no sign of its objectives being met: the complete destruction of Hamas and bringing home Israel’s remaining hostages. The latest poll gives Likud as many as 25 seats. Altogether coalition parties would be expected to take 49 seats, while opposition parties would win 66. According to the research for Channel 12, Netanyahu also remains the favourite candidate for prime minister over the centrist opposition leader, Yair Lapid - with 38% favouring him over his rival who has 27% support. Much in Israeli politics depends on what happens next as Israel’s multi-front war reaches a critical moment. As Israel hints at a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, tens of thousands of Israeli citizens in the north of the country still do not know when they will return to their homes - an official goal for Israel. If Hezbollah’s main ally Iran decides to attack, the consequences are unpredictable. On the international stage, Israel looks increasingly isolated. International courts are considering whether to put Israel on trial for genocide and have requested an arrest warrant for the prime minister and his defence minister on allegations of crimes against humanity. The ultimate test of Netanyahu’s resilience could be yet to come."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o,Massive blasts in Beirut after renewed Israeli air strikes,Explosions are seen close to Beirut's airport as Israel continues targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:36.996581,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli bombing caused large explosions in Beirut, including one close to the international airport during a further night of air strikes targeting Hezbollah. The airport borders Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital. Plumes of smoke could be seen over the city on Friday morning. US outlets citing Israeli officials reported the target was Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Hezbollah's former leader Hassan Nasrallah. Safieddine has been widely regarded as the most likely candidate to replace Nasrallah after his death in an Israeli strike last week. Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks in the last 24 hours while 151 others had been wounded. Elsewhere, the Lebanese army said two of its soldiers had been killed in the country's south as Israeli forces pressed on with their invasion against Hezbollah and ordered another 20 towns and villages to evacuate. The Israeli military has not commented, but did say its troops had killed Hezbollah fighters near the border. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli troops on both sides of the frontier. The two fatal attacks on the Lebanese army soldiers were just hours apart on Thursday, the third full day of the invasion. In the first incident, the army said, one soldier was killed and another was wounded “as a result of an aggression by the Israeli enemy during an evacuation and rescue operation with the Lebanese Red Cross in Taybeh village"". The Red Cross said four of its volunteers were also lightly wounded, and that their movements had been co-ordinated with UN peacekeepers. The army said that in the second incident another soldier was killed “after the Israeli enemy targeted an army post in the Bint Jbeil area”. “The personnel at the post responded to the sources of fire,” the Lebanese army added, marking a rare involvement in a conflict in which it has not engaged. The news came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the south, including the regional capital of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their own safety. Unlike the communities ordered to evacuate on Tuesday, they are all located north of the Litani river, which lies about 30km (18 miles) from the border. Before the invasion, Israel had demanded that Hezbollah’s withdraw to the Litani, in accordance with a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006. Speaking to the BBC from Beirut, the World Food Programme's country director in Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, described the situation there as “horrific”. “There is black smoke billowing over the southern suburbs and we see it each morning when we come to work and we see it all day long. And there's a striking number of people who are displaced around the city.” “There are these cars everywhere that are from people that have fled the fighting in the south of the country and the southern suburbs. There's traffic everywhere, people sleeping outside.” Juan Gabriel Wells, Lebanon country director with the International Rescue Committee, said nearly half of displaced people surveyed by his organisation in shelters run by the government were children under the age of 15. Israel's latest air strikes on Beirut come 24 hours after a residential building in the centre of the capital was hit. A civil defence agency linked to Hezbollah also said seven of its first responders were among nine people killed in the strike. Lebanon’s health minister later said more than 40 paramedics and firefighters had been killed by Israeli fire in the past three days. The Israeli Air Force carried out air strikes during Thursday against targets it said belonged to Hezbollah including the group's intelligence headquarters, weapons production sites, weapons storage facilities. Two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks targeting Hezbollah have killed more than 1,300 people across Lebanon and displaced more than one million, according to local authorities. Israel went on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist military, political and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries. The IDF also announced on Thursday that its aircraft had struck 200 Hezbollah “terrorist targets” in southern Lebanon and elsewhere overnight, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts. About 15 Hezbollah fighters were killed when the municipality building in Bint Jbeil was hit, it said. Later, it said a structure housing three Hezbollah commanders had been destroyed during a joint operation carried out by the air force and infantry. Hezbollah said on Thursday evening that its fighters had “repelled failed attempts” by Israeli commandos to advance into some border villages during the day. The group also said it had targeted “enemy gatherings” and homes on the other side of the frontier, while also continuing to fire rockets deep into northern Israel. The IDF said more than 230 projectiles had been launched into Israeli territory over the course of the day. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, and there were no casualty reports. The communities sitting along Israel’s northern border fence are now a closed military zone. Dean Sweetland, a former British soldier who moved to Israel eight years ago, is one of the few people still living in a near-empty kibbutz within sight of the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil. He told the BBC that his house shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon, some of them intercepted by Israel’s air-defences overhead. “We can’t continue this for another year, having Hezbollah sitting on our border just waiting to do an October 7th on us,” he said, referring to Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last year that triggered the Gaza war. “But my son is in the army, and do we want our kids to be in there, slaughtered, where Hezbollah has been waiting for us to go in for nearly 20 years?” “It’s not going to be pretty,” he continued, “but if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jm4ggjgyo,"Israeli strike on Gaza school sheltering displaced kills 28, paramedics say",Israel's military says it targeted Hamas fighters operating at the school in the town of Deir al-Balah.,4 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:48.162536,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 28 people have been killed and 54 injured in an Israeli air strike on a school sheltering displaced families in the central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Red Crescent says. Videos from the scene at Rufaida al-Aslamia school in the town of Deir al-Balah show a cloud of smoke and dust rising up as people rush to help the injured. Witnesses said there were two air strikes that hit two rooms in the school where food aid was being stored and distributed. The Israeli military said the “precise strike” targeted Hamas fighters operating inside a ""command-and-control centre” at the school. It also said it had taken numerous steps to mitigate harm to the civilians living there. “This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organisation’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,” it added. Hamas has denied the allegation. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry also put the death toll at 28 and denounced what it called a “new massacre” by the Israeli military. A list published by al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah suggested that at least two of those killed were children, five were women and three were men in their 60s. Another person named on the list was Ahmed Adel Hamouda, 58, whose widow said he had worked in the school’s administration. “They killed my only support in life. They killed the support of our three disabled daughters, Rahab, Alaa and Reem,” she said. Eyewitness Khaled al-Sultan told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme that he saw “horrible things that are beyond description”. “We were not able to retrieve one complete body because all the victims' bodies turned into pieces. The number of martyrs is shocking,” he added. Another man, Taha Majad, asked: “Why would a shelter school like this be bombed by F-16 jets? We are humans, aren’t we?” Many schools have been turned into shelters for the 1.9 million Palestinians who have fled their homes since the war in Gaza started a year ago. Despite that, the UN says more than 200 schools have been hit, with at least 50 being completely destroyed. Rufaida school is located inside the Israeli-designated al-Mawasi “humanitarian area”, where the Israeli military has told Palestinians to flee despite it being overcrowded and lacking basic services. They include all of the estimated 400,000 people currently living in the north of Gaza, where Israeli forces are continuing a ground offensive on Jabalia and its urban refugee camp. Reuters news agency cited Palestinian health officials as saying that at least 130 people had been killed since Sunday, when the Israeli military announced it was launching an operation in response to intelligence that Hamas fighters were regrouping there. The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning its forces had killed “more than 50 terrorist operatives” and located large quantities of weapons in the Jabalia area over the previous 24 hours. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,060 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk707kv3dvo,Beirut residents ignore Netanyahu's call to rise up against Hezbollah,Beirut residents tell the BBC what they made of the Israeli PM's appeal to take back their country from Hezbollah.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:48.273221,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a video address Tuesday, which he said was directed at the people of Lebanon, telling them to turn against the Iran-backed Shia group Hezbollah or risk destruction on the scale of Gaza. “Christians, Druze, Muslims Sunni and Shia, all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah’s futile war against Israel,” he said. “Stand up and take your country back.” But in Shia, Sunni and Christian neighbourhoods of Beirut on Wednesday morning, Netanyahu’s warning was falling largely – if not entirely – being ignored. “Yes we heard the address but nobody here listens to Netanyahu,” said Yusuf Habbal, 31, as he cut pieces of the traditional Lebanese sweet Kunafah in his shop in Tariq El Jdideh, a Sunni area. “Nobody told Netanyahu to occupy Palestine, nobody told him to occupy Lebanon. It is the Israelis who are driving this conflict.” But Habbal and his fellow Sunnis “also do not accept what Hezbollah is doing”, he said. “Before Netanyahu ever spoke about Hezbollah, we were against them. Beiruti people know that Hezbollah has their own agenda. And now they are driving us into a war we do not want.” Hezbollah, which is a better-armed and more powerful force in Lebanon than the country’s own military, began firing rockets into northern Israel a year ago, in support for Hamas the day after the brutal 7 October attack. The Hezbollah rockets signalled the beginning of a new phase of its clash with Israel. Last month, Israel escalated that simmering conflict when it expanded its bombing campaign of Lebanon, including in Beirut, before launching a ground invasion in the south of the country.  “They are striking very close to us now and it is terrifying,” said Mohammed Khair, 43, as he had his hair cut in a barber shop in Tariq El Jdideh. “Nobody here wants this war, but nobody is going to be turned against Hezbollah by something Netanyahu said in a video,” he said. Netanyahu was “always talking to the Palestinians, to the Lebanese,” said Tarraf Nasser, a 76-year-old retiree who was passing by the barber shop. “Nobody listens to Netanyahu,” he said. “He is not really talking to us.” In Achrafieh, Beirut’s main Christian neighbourhood, there was a sense of futility at the Lebanese people’s ability to heed Netanyahu’s advice, even if they wanted to. Antoine, a 75-year-old Catholic retiree, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was smoking a cigarette outside the neighbourhood's Brewholic Café. “Benjamin Netanyahu is the prime minister of Israel, not Lebanon. He should take care of his people, not ours,” Antoine said. “At the same time, it is true that we have to do something to be free from the influence of Iran. But we don’t have weapons and we don’t have politicians who can be truly Lebanese. All our politicians are affiliated to other states or groups, mostly Iran."" Nobody in Lebanon was going to have domestic conflict because Netanyahu instructed them to, Antoine said. “We will do that on our own.” Across the road in her shoe shop, Maya Habib, 35, gave a tired shrug at the Israeli prime minister’s video appeal. “Everyone here knows that Israel lies,” she said. “But listen, maybe he has a point. He warned everyone – don’t attack us, don’t come close to us, and it won’t be your war. Now it is.” Among the Christians of Achrafieh, “people are paying attention” to Netanyahu, Habib said. “But nobody can do anything anyway,” she said, shrugging again. “We don’t even have a president. Netanyahu is saying all the weapons should go to the Lebanese army, but how?” Hezbollah can still rely on staunch support in the neighbourhoods where it is the dominant force in political and social life, and among the Shia communities of mixed areas. Several Shia residents of the Mar Elias neighbourhood said they stood completely behind the group. “We are all Hezbollah here, whatever Hezbollah does we will support them,” said Fadi Ali Kiryani, a 52-year-old corner shop owner. Like other people in Mar Elias, Kiryani said he was not concerned by Netanyahu’s threat that Lebanon would suffer the same destruction and suffering as Gaza. “Even if it becomes worse here than Gaza, we will still fly the flag,” he said. “My house in Dahieh has already been destroyed. I would rather my house was gone than the shoe on the foot of one Hezbollah fighter was damaged.” Sitting behind the desk of her 40-year-old towel and bedlinens shop, 75-year-old Fany Sharara said that Hezbollah was the only force defending the people of Lebanon. “Nothing Netanyahu could say could change my mind,” she said. “He is a criminal, an assassin, he cannot leave one child alive.” Israel had “all of Europe and all of America” on its side, Sharara added. “We are with Hezbollah because they are the only ones defending us. Not the Lebanese government.” A few doors down, and a few years younger, 24-year-old jewellery shop owner Ali Shoura was simply weary of everyone involved, he said. “Nobody really cares - the politicians, the people in power, the Lebanese government, Iran, Israel, America, Hezbollah too."" He shook his head. “It's all just theatre,” he said. “And we are all the victims.”  Joanna Mazjoub contributed to this report.  Update 11th October: This article’s headline and introduction have been amended to better reflect Benjamin Netanyahu’s message to the people of Lebanon."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3we9n0v79o,"UK-Israeli hostage has been forgotten, says mum","A mother calls for the UK to do more to rescue her daughter, taken as a hostage during the 7 October attacks.",8 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:48.390353,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The mother of the only British-Israeli hostage still being held by Hamas in Gaza has asked why the UK is not ""fighting every moment to secure her release"".  Emily Damari, 28, was shot and taken from an Israeli kibbutz across the border into Gaza on 7 October. Speaking at a London memorial event marking the attacks a year ago, her mother Mandy Damari said her daughter's ""plight seems to have been forgotten"".  Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement the UK ""must unequivocally stand with the Jewish community"". The dual national is among 97 hostages who remain unaccounted for.  Speaking at the Hyde Park memorial event, her mother said: ""[Emily] is a daughter of both countries, but no one here mentions the fact that there is still a female British hostage being held captive by Hamas for a year now, and I sometimes wonder if people even know there is a British woman there. ""Imagine, for a moment if Emily was your daughter. Try to picture what she is going through.  ""Since 7 October last year, she has been held a hostage by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza terror tunnels, 20 metres or more underground, kept in captivity, tortured, isolated, unable to eat, speak or even move without someone else's permission.” The crowd heard how Emily, who was born to her British mother in Israel and lived there, loved to visit the UK - her ""second home across the sea"". She loved watching Spurs play, going to the pub, shopping at Primark and had also watched Ed Sheeran in concert, her mother said. Her mother pleaded with Britain and other countries to do more to secure the release of her daughter, and the other hostages. “How is it that she is still imprisoned there after one year? Why isn't the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release? She's one of their own.” She said some of the women and children who were released in the hostage deal in November had told her Emily was alive then, and spoke about how she helped the other hostages try to stay positive, even in the worst of times.  “Every day is living hell not knowing what Emily is going through. I do know from the hostages that returned that they were starved, sexually abused and tortured. Every moment lost is another moment of unimaginable suffering or even death.” BBC News has approached the UK Foreign Office for comment.  Other hostages with British relatives held include Eli Sharabi, Oded Lifschitz and Avinatan Or. British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell was also kidnapped on 7 October and his body was recovered by Israeli soldiers in Gaza in August. Families of Israeli hostages met Sir Keir and Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Monday, calling on them to ""do more"" to bring them home. The prime minister agreed that the hostages must be freed and returned immediately, a subsequent press conference was told.  On Sunday, he said the country must ""unequivocally"" stand with the Jewish community and described 7 October as the ""darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust”.  “As a father, a husband, a son, a brother – meeting the families of those who lost their loved ones last week was unimaginable. Their grief and pain are ours, and it is shared in homes across the land,"" Sir Keir said. He also reiterated his call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.  The Hyde Park event, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups, was attended by thousands of British Jews and supporters of Israel who waved British and Israeli flags with chants of ""bring them home"".  Among the crowd, many of whom have family and friends in Israel, there was disbelief that the hostages still had not been freed, one year on. Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely told the crowd: ""We will do whatever we can to bring them home."" Michael Wegier, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told BBC News: ""The British Jewish community is traumatised like much of the Jewish community around the world, especially in Israel.  ""There are 30,000 Jews from Britain who live in Israel. Many of us have friends and family there and we go there, and so we take what happens there very deeply and very personally.""  A vigil to remember the victims of the Hamas attack was also held in Glasgow where hundreds gathered at the steps of Kelvingrove Art Gallery. On the eve of 7 October, a man was filmed damaging a Jewish memorial in Hove. Sussex Police responded to the video, which had been circulated on X and other social media platforms, and confirmed the incident was being treated as a ""hate crime"". On Saturday tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors marched through central London calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. At least 41,870 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ljj21n33o,Tanks and jets on the move at Israel-Lebanon border,"A BBC team has travelled to the Israel-Lebanon border, where an escalating conflict is playing out.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:48.535248,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Here on the Israeli side of the border, tanks and aircraft have been on the move, as the ground war that Israel and Hezbollah had avoided for almost two decades began. Fields a few miles from the border that yesterday were full of dozens of tanks, are emptying - almost the entire fighting force there has gone, and a column of armoured vehicles were preparing to move out. On Sunday night, helicopters and jets flew low across this border, to the regular “crump” of artillery and occasional loud explosions. Hezbollah says it fired rockets at Israeli troops this morning along the border at Metula and Avivim, and there were also several loud interceptions directly above us, a little further south. At an army checkpoint outside Metula, Israeli artillery was still firing this morning as a group of soldiers waited to go in. Israel’s army says its ground forces crossed the border last night in a “limited and targeted” incursion, but it’s not immediately clear how many units have been sent in, and where. A senior security official said today that the operations were “very limited in scope” and said there were currently “no clashes”. When asked how far into Lebanon the Israeli forces had gone, he declined to be specific but said they were “very close, walking distance - not far in”, and that the numbers involved were not those of a large ground invasion, but something more limited. Israel says its aim is to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure along the border that it says poses an imminent threat to Israeli communities. But sending ground troops even a short distance into Lebanon carries significant risks to its army.  Hezbollah - well armed with anti-tank missiles and mines - has been preparing to meet Israeli forces on this terrain for years. What’s not clear is how far Israel is preparing to push forward into Lebanese territory, whether its aim is to remove the threat of infiltration from Hezbollah fighters and tunnels, or whether it is planning to push the group further north - a much bigger and riskier undertaking for Israeli army."

The Palestinian Football Association (PFA) submitted a proposal to have Israel suspended from international football in May over the war in Gaza. ""The Fifa Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offence of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" Fifa said.  The PFA believes Israel's federation has committed ""violations of Fifa regulations"" and called for sanctions against the country's national teams and clubs. Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: ""The Fifa Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts. ""The ongoing violence in the region confirms that, above all considerations, and as stated at the 74th Fifa Congress, we need peace. ""As we remain extremely shocked by what is happening, and our thoughts are with those who are suffering, we urge all parties to restore peace to the region with immediate effect."" Two investigations have been mandated by the Fifa Council into the IFA, with the first into allegations of discrimination within its national league, to be conducted by Fifa's disciplinary committee. The governing body said that the second, led by Fifa's governance, audit and compliance committee, will consider ""the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine"". Israel are playing their Nations League home matches in Hungary, where an away game against Belgium last month was also moved because of security concerns. They are scheduled to host France and play in Italy during the international break in October. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since the attack, a military campaign in Gaza has killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Fifa Council met on Thursday with Israel launching a ground invasion in southern Lebanon against the armed group Hezbollah, while Iran has fired more than 180 missiles towards Israel. Shino Moshe Zuares, the president of the IFA, previously said: ""We are facing a cynical political and hostile attempt by the Palestinian association to harm Israeli football."" Also announced after Fifa's meeting in Zurich on Thursday were regulations regarding the Fifa Club World Cup and a change to next summer's transfer window. The expanded tournament in 2025 will have 32 teams competing in the United States from 15 June to 13 July. Fifa member associations of participating clubs will have the option of opening an ""exceptional registration window"" for new signings from 1 to 10 June. Competing clubs will also be able to replace players during a ""a restricted in-competition period"" from 27 June to 3 July.  Fifa said this was in order to ""encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation"". The decision to open the additional window is at the discretion of each member association - Chelsea and Manchester City have qualified from England. Fifa has also said it will request an expansion of the Olympic women's football tournament from 12 to 16 teams, in line with the men's event.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2591w37q9o,'I grabbed my grandchildren and ran': Lebanon families flee Israeli strikes,People sleeping rough at a Beirut school describe fleeing Israel's bombardment with moments to spare.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:48.833062,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's continuing air strikes may have forced as many as one million people from their homes across Lebanon, the country's prime minister, Najib Mikati, has said. Lebanon's health ministry reported 105 people killed in Sunday's strikes - two days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel. Lebanese families displaced by the air strikes have told the BBC of their fear and anxiety over what is to come.  We visited one school in a southern Beirut suburb housing around 2,000 people who have fled their homes. Many of them were having to sleep in the courtyard because they could not find space indoors.  Grandmother Um Ahmad says a building just next to their home in southern Lebanon was badly hit by an Israeli air strike. She and her family survived “magically”, she says.  “I just grabbed my grandchildren and ran. A part of our house was in flames."" They jumped into their car and drove off while more buildings were being bombed in their street. They looked back to see their house was also levelled to the ground.  “At least we know for sure that we don’t have a home to go back to,” Um Ahmed says while trying not to break into tears. “I don’t want to cry. There is nothing to cry about any more. We lost everything, but thanks to God, we survived.” They fled to Beirut from a tiny village near the city of Tyre. Their refuge is a classroom that is now a shelter for hundreds of people. Laundry is draped around the room, hanging off the whiteboard, walls and windows.  Um Ahmed’s two grandsons have disabilities and mental health issues.  She sounds frustrated and angry: ""I’m sad for Gaza’s children, but what is our children’s fault?” We hear a loud bang as emergency teams offload some supplies outside in the corridor. Her younger grandson starts crying. “Look how the child is scared. With every loud sound, every door slamming, he starts crying and screaming.” She says her grandchildren can’t sleep at night any more, so she and her husband cannot either. “All the children here are reacting to any loud sound. They think it’s an air strike.” Um's husband Barakat joins us. He blames the politicians without mentioning Hezbollah.  “I know we needed to support the people of Gaza, but that wasn’t our war. We of course want to protect our land, but for us, for the Lebanese, we should fight for ourselves.” Like many other families here, they have been displaced before. They lost their homes in 1982 and 2006 too. This is now the third time.  Barakat says he and his family are exhausted and don’t want war. ""We don’t wish for Israeli children to die, nor for our own children to die. We should live in peace.” I ask him if he thinks that is possible. “I don’t think so. Netanyahu doesn’t want peace. It is now very clear and this war is going to be much harder than 2006 [when Israel and Hezbollah went to war], for sure.” “Just as we cry for children in Gaza, we cry for our own children too. Just as the Israelis cry and are afraid for their children, so do we,” says Um. Other families recall being warned by the Israeli military of impending attacks. “We only had short notice. We received a message that was sent by the Israeli army to our phones, asking us to leave our house,” says 65-year-old Kamal Mouhsen. “I just grabbed my car key and left with my family.” He was one of many people who received the same message at about noon on Saturday. He says there was a series of air strikes on their neighbourhood soon afterwards. He is wearing a T-shirt and shorts. “All we have now is what you see we are wearing.” He is sitting with his daughter, grandson and two of his neighbours in the courtyard of the school where they took refuge.  “We are now among 16 people living in one room,” says Nada, Kamal’s daughter. “In the 2006 war, we also came here."" Nada believes this war will be more difficult. “They [the Israelis] killed the leader of Hezbollah. This itself shows that this time is different.” For others, leaving the country through war-torn Syria seemed like a better option than hoping to survive Israeli air strikes. Sara Tohmaz, a 34-year-old Lebanese journalist, fled her house in Beirut’s southern suburbs with her mother and two siblings the Friday before last.  She told BBC News Arabic she feels relief that they took the decision to leave the country before Israel assassinated Hezbollah's leader.  The family took almost 10 hours to reach Jordan through Syria by car. “We are lucky enough to have a place to stay in Jordan, where my mother’s relatives are based,"" she says. ""We don’t know what will happen next, and don’t know when we will be back."" Additional reporting by Ethar Shalaby, BBC News Arabic"

Tanks reportedly advanced into some parts of the city and its surrounding area on Tuesday night, with residents reporting gunfire and heavy shelling. One wounded man who made it to hospital told the BBC “tanks stormed in” to his village without warning. Separately, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck Hamas targets located in four schools sheltering displaced people in central and northern Gaza. The IDF said Hamas members were operating inside ""command and control centres""  embedded inside the Muscat, Rimal, Bureij and Nuseirat Girls schools.  Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that at least nine civilians were killed at Muscat School, in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, and that six others were killed at the Al-Amal Institute for Orphans, in the Rimal neighbourhood. Later, the Al-Amal Institute for Orphans said in a Facebook post that eight people were killed and a large number wounded, including children and women, when an Israeli strike hit one of its buildings housing hundreds of displaced civilians. Gaza's Civil Defence officials also said that three people had been killed and 15 injured when Israel on Wednesday bombed Nuseirat Girls' School in central Gaza, the site of a refugee camp. Israel’s continued strikes on Gaza come one day after it repelled a barrage of missiles from Iran and launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. It has described Tuesday's advance into Lebanon as a “limited” operation, targeting sites belonging to the Lebanese-armed group Hezbollah after a year of cross-border fighting. The IDF is yet to comment on the strikes in southern Gaza, which reportedly occurred at dawn on Wednesday. But one man from Qizan al-Najjar village, south-east of Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic that some of his relatives had been killed in the attack. ""Tanks stormed into the area, accompanied by quadcopters that directly targeted us,"" he said, speaking from Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where medical officials also gave updates on the death toll.  Another man at the hospital said: ""We were in Qizan al-Najjar when suddenly, shells began to rain down on us from planes and tanks."" A third man told BBC Arabic: ""There was no prior warning. Following the rocket fire from Lebanon, we witnessed complete destruction. I barely survived; my daughter is injured, and my wife has a head injury that may lead to vision loss."" He said Israeli forces had also ""completely destroyed"" a house where displaced families had been sheltering. Gaza's health ministry on Wednesday warned the death toll could rise, with another 82 people injured in the strikes. The IDF has launched multiple ground operations targeting Hamas fighters in Khan Younis - Gaza’s second-largest urban area - since December. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jwv16qwqjo,"Israeli strikes on Gaza mosque and school kill 26, health ministry says","Dozens were also reported injured in the strikes, which Israel said were targeting Hamas.",6 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:49.321641,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 26 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on a mosque and school housing displaced Palestinians in the centre of the territory. Dozens of people were also injured in strikes that hit Ibn Rushd school and Al-Aqsa Martyrs mosque in Deir al-Balah early on Sunday morning, the ministry said. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating within ""command and control"" centres at the sites. In north Gaza, Israeli forces surrounded the Jabalia area in response to what it said were Hamas efforts to rebuild.  The military also issued new possible evacuation zones in the north and re-opened routes to a humanitarian area. Following the strikes in central Gaza, videos verified by the BBC as being from the mosque show bodies and blood on the ground among the rubble, while footage at the school shows the structure on fire and a man being pulled out on a stretcher. Earlier, the Hamas-run civil defence agency said 21 people were killed and a large number wounded in the strike on the mosque, according to the AFP news agency. Reuters news agency reported that at least 93 people were injured in the airstrikes, according to data from Gaza's Hamas-run media office. Sunday's strikes occurred almost exactly one year on from 7 October 2023, when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Since then, 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and more than 97,000 injured in Gaza, according to the health ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. According to the United Nations, which uses Gaza health ministry figures and considers them reliable, 187 people were killed in Gaza from 30 September to 4 October alone. In a statement on the strike on the mosque, Hamas accused Israel of ""bombing citizens' homes and demolishing them over their heads, resulting in the deaths and injuries of dozens"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that ""before the attacks many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, including the use of precision weaponry, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information.""  The IDF accused Hamas of ""exploiting civilian institutions and the population as human shields for terrorist acts"". Later on Sunday, the IDF said it carried out an air strike on another school in northern Gaza, saying it was being used as a Hamas ""command and control complex"". Hamas has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes. Elsewhere in Gaza, Israel's military began to surround Jabalia in the north overnight in response to what the IDF said were efforts by Hamas to rebuild in the area. The military said it had struck ""dozens of military targets"" before and during the ground operation. The IDF warned the public that north Gaza is ""still considered a dangerous combat zone"" and published a new map on Sunday showing zones for potential evacuation in the north.  It also said it had expanded the humanitarian zone in al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, although it is still smaller than it was at the start of July. Both the mosque and the school hit on Sunday are located in the humanitarian zone. The IDF said it had re-opened two evacuation routes from the north to access the zone. Israel does not allow international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it hard to verify the facts on the ground."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dyxxgxv1jo,Iran launches more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel,"Israel warns of consequences for the attack, which Iran says was retaliation for attacks on its allies.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:53.383992,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel says Iran has launched more than 180 missiles towards the country in a large-scale attack that has further heightened fears of an all-out regional war. Millions of people rushed to shelters before explosions lit up the night skies above Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A man was killed by falling missile debris in the city of Jericho in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials said. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake"" and ""will pay for it"". Iranian state TV said Iran had fired 200 missiles towards Israel. These included hypersonic weapons, it said, while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the strikes were in retaliation for the killings of the leaders of its allies Hezbollah and Hamas. Within hours of the massive barrage on Tuesday evening local time, Israel's military resumed air strikes against what it said were Hezbollah targets in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. US President Joe Biden said the Iranian missile attack appeared to have been “defeated and ineffective”. The US Department of Defense confirmed its forces had helped shoot down missiles in support of its Middle East ally. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the majority of missiles were ""intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States"".  UN secretary general Antonio Guterres condemned what he called the “broadening conflict in the Middle East”, adding: “This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire.” There was support for Israel from allies including Britain, France, Japan and Australia - with UK Defence Secretary John Healey issuing a statement saying the armed forces ""had played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East"". The missile attack came hours after Israeli troops began an invasion of southern Lebanon to remove what the military said were ""Hezbollah terror targets” in border villages that posed a threat to residents of northern Israel. Israel has gone on the offensive against the Iran-backed Shia Islamist political and military organisation after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war with Hamas in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, drone and missile attacks. Air raid sirens sounded all across Israel at around 19:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday, as the IDF warned missiles had been launched from Iran. Within a few minutes in Jerusalem, loud explosions were heard in Jerusalem as missiles flew overhead and were intercepted by Israeli air defence systems. Videos shared on social media showed streams of light as the missiles flew over Israel, and clouds of smoke as they were intercepted or detonated on impact. Just over an hour later, the IDF announced that people were allowed to leave their protected spaces because it did “not identify any additional aerial threats from Iran”. Later, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that “there were a small number of hits in the centre of Israel, and other hits in Southern Israel”. “The majority of the incoming missiles were intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States.” He added: “Iran’s attack is a severe and dangerous escalation. There will be consequences. “Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest levels of readiness. Our operational plans are ready.  ""We will respond wherever, whenever, and however we choose, in accordance with the directive of the government of Israel.” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House that he did “not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel”. “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he added. He also condemned the attack as “a significant escalation” and warned: ""We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case.” Speaking on Wednesday, Iran's chief of staff Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri told state TV that it would hit infrastructure across Israel if it decides to strike back. The barrage ""will be repeated with bigger intensity and all infrastructure of the regime will be targeted"", Mr Bagheri said. Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps said it had targeted unspecified ""sensitive security and military"" centres in retaliation for the ""violation of Iran’s sovereignty and the martyrdom” of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed by an explosion in Tehran in July that Iranian officials blamed on Israel, but Israeli officials did not claim. The statement described the missile barrage as having been ""in line with the legitimate right of the nation to defend itself”. It also said the attack was in response to the Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, the operations commander of the IRGC’s overseas arm, the Quds Force. Later, Iranian state media claimed that missiles had hit the Nevatim, Hazterim and Tel Nof air bases, as well as Israeli tanks in Netzarim – a reference to an Israeli military corridor in central Gaza – and gas installations in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. The attack took place about an hour after a senior White House official told reporters that the US had indications that Iran was preparing to imminently launch missiles at Israel. In April, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for a deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria that killed several top commanders. Almost all of them were shot down by Israel, the US and other Western allies and their Arab partners, and an air base in southern Israel sustained only minor damage when it was hit. Israel responded by launching a missile that hit an Iranian air base after Western calls for restraint. On Saturday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had promised that the death of his close ally Hassan Nasrallah would “not go unavenged"". He gave no details, but said: ""The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront."" Iran has built a network of allied armed groups across the Middle East, which are all opposed to the US and Israel and sometimes refer to themselves as the “Axis of Resistance”. Besides Hezbollah, they include Hamas in the Palestinian territories, the Houthis in Yemen, and a number of Shia militias in Iraq and Syria."

The Palestinian Football Association (PFA) submitted a proposal to have Israel suspended from international football in May over the war in Gaza. ""The Fifa Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offence of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" Fifa said.  The PFA believes Israel's federation has committed ""violations of Fifa regulations"" and called for sanctions against the country's national teams and clubs. Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: ""The Fifa Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts. ""The ongoing violence in the region confirms that, above all considerations, and as stated at the 74th Fifa Congress, we need peace. ""As we remain extremely shocked by what is happening, and our thoughts are with those who are suffering, we urge all parties to restore peace to the region with immediate effect."" Two investigations have been mandated by the Fifa Council into the IFA, with the first into allegations of discrimination within its national league, to be conducted by Fifa's disciplinary committee. The governing body said that the second, led by Fifa's governance, audit and compliance committee, will consider ""the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine"". Israel are playing their Nations League home matches in Hungary, where an away game against Belgium last month was also moved because of security concerns. They are scheduled to host France and play in Italy during the international break in October. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since the attack, a military campaign in Gaza has killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Fifa Council met on Thursday with Israel launching a ground invasion in southern Lebanon against the armed group Hezbollah, while Iran has fired more than 180 missiles towards Israel. Shino Moshe Zuares, the president of the IFA, previously said: ""We are facing a cynical political and hostile attempt by the Palestinian association to harm Israeli football."" Also announced after Fifa's meeting in Zurich on Thursday were regulations regarding the Fifa Club World Cup and a change to next summer's transfer window. The expanded tournament in 2025 will have 32 teams competing in the United States from 15 June to 13 July. Fifa member associations of participating clubs will have the option of opening an ""exceptional registration window"" for new signings from 1 to 10 June. Competing clubs will also be able to replace players during a ""a restricted in-competition period"" from 27 June to 3 July.  Fifa said this was in order to ""encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation"". The decision to open the additional window is at the discretion of each member association - Chelsea and Manchester City have qualified from England. Fifa has also said it will request an expansion of the Olympic women's football tournament from 12 to 16 teams, in line with the men's event.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5p8vjwlko,Surgeon says Gaza 'like an atomic bomb has dropped',A retired UK surgeon deals with bombing and shooting victims at a hospital in Gaza.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:53.636427,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A retired surgeon has described dealing with daily influxes of bombing and shooting victims while volunteering at a hospital in Gaza. Prof Nizam Mamode, from Brockenhurst, Hampshire, worked at Nasser hospital for a month in August and September and has just returned to the UK. The 62-year-old said each day he saw between 10 and 20 deaths and up to 40 people with serious injuries. The former clinical lead of transplant surgery at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London said most of the victims were women and children. Prof Mamode said the hospital, which was raided by the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) in February, was the last one in Gaza that was ""still functioning on a significant level"". He said doctors were coping with one or two mass casualty events a day, following bombings and drone attacks. The surgeon, who has previously worked in other conflict zones, said it was ""unlike anything that I've ever seen before"". He recalled: ""It was a complete shock. The moment you cross the border into Gaza it's as if an atomic bomb has dropped. ""All you see is rubble for miles around. You're driving for 30 minutes through this landscape, there's hardly anybody around, just a few armed looters. ""And then you come to the central area of Gaza where you've got a million and a half people just crammed together in a very, very small area, with so-called tents on every piece of land available. ""We were dealing mainly with trauma victims... people who were missing their arms, their legs.  ""I think one of the things that shocked me most was the fact that this just continued day after day and has been going on like this for a year now. ""There was no real let-up. Pretty much every day we'd be dealing with these casualties."" Prof Mamode said he was willing to return to Gaza if called upon. His visit was arranged with British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, which has been active since 1982. Last year Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. The incursion was to become the deadliest attack in Israeli history and as of September 2024, around 100 people are still believed to be held hostage in Gaza. Israel then launched a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military insists it does not target civilians and has accused Hamas of using the population as a human shield.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxlrlkk8k8o,Devastating setback for evacuated Gaza teen after surgery,The ongoing Israel-Hamas war broke out 12 days before the girl was to receive treatment in Jerusalem.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:53.982065,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Three months after a 13-year-old girl left Gaza for medical treatment, she is in intensive care in a UAE hospital after complications from surgery. Lamis Abusalim has severe scoliosis that, if left untreated, could compress her lungs and eventually kill her. Before her surgery she spent most of the time on her back, because when she sat up, she struggled for air. But during an operation to correct her condition on 4 October, her heart stopped three times, her mother said. Doctors told the family the girl had suffered some brain damage. It is a devastating setback for Lamis and her family, who had spent months trying to escape the war in Gaza to get medical help. Their story was mentioned in BBC coverage of a wider evacuation in July. Lamis had been due to undergo treatment in Jerusalem last October following three unsuccessful operations in Gaza.  But since the start of Israel’s military offensive following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, most of Gaza's residents have been unable to leave the territory. Eventually, Lamis and her mother were able to get on a list to evacuate with the help of international organisations. After the complicated surgery, the family is now seeking help to transfer Lamis to the UK or another country for further treatment, although it would be difficult to move her. ""All kids have the right to live in a safe place, in a good place, and seek treatment,"" said her mother, Shatha. ""The kids are not the ones who make the conflict."" The months-long, multi-national effort to evacuate Lamis reveals how hard it is for Palestinians in Gaza to access medical care. Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 251 back to Gaza as hostages. The Israeli military offensive that followed has killed more than 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The bombardments have closed hospitals, killed doctors, and overwhelmed remaining facilities with casualties. The Israeli military says it has attacked some hospitals because, it says, Hamas combatants have been using them as bases. Hamas denies this. Before the war, Lamis, a “beautiful child” and youngest of five, loved drawing and attending her special education school, her mother said. At six months old she was diagnosed with a genetic white matter disease. Dr Joshua Bonkowsky, a professor of paediatric neurology at University of Utah Health said it was a category of brain disease that leaves a third of children dead by the age of eight. He was not familiar with Lamis’ case. Barely any of the diseases are curable, but treatment is available for resulting conditions. In January, the health ministry in Gaza referred Lamis for treatment abroad for her scoliosis. The ministry recorded that she had respiratory compromise and difficulty swallowing food, and recommended surgery. Her family reached out to charity HEAL Palestine, which arranged treatment with a US hospital, while an Israeli NGO, Gisha, sought security clearance for evacuation. In June, Lamis received clearance a day before an evacuation via the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, but did not get on the list in time to leave, according to Gisha. Then, in late July, her mother received a call from the World Health Organization (WHO) that she and her daughter would be evacuating. After a last-minute delay - which led Shatha to take her daughter on a two-hour journey back home to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza - they received another call the next day saying the evacuation was back on. Shatha said goodbye to her husband without knowing when they would see each other again. “It was really difficult for me,” Shatha said. “I did not want to look back.” Shatha boarded the bus to depart Gaza carrying only a handbag and Lamis on her back, as they had to leave the girl's wheelchair and bags packed with clothes. Lamis cried in pain on the bus ride to the border with Israel, where they took another bus before boarding a flight to the UAE. On a call in August, Shatha told the BBC she had ""finally achieved this dream"". Lamis is one of 229 patients to have left Gaza since May, according to WHO. Almost 4,900 patients - 35% of those who submitted requests - evacuated through the Rafah crossing into Egypt from November until May, when Israel launched a ground offensive and seized control of the Gazan side of the crossing. An estimated 12,000 patients still need evacuation. WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said people are “suffering needlessly“ and urged the “establishment of evacuation corridors via all possible routes”. Cogat, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, told the BBC Israel was “actively working on multiple fronts to establish a mechanism for evacuating patients with complex medical conditions, who require further treatment outside the Gaza Strip"". The agency said Israel was in “constant communication” with aid organisations, health authorities and countries, and reviewed evacuation requests, providing an “appropriate response, subject to security arrangements“. Since arriving in the UAE, the government has paid for Lamis' accommodation, pocket money and stay in hospital, where on Friday she remained in a critical condition. Her mother said that ""the most important thing is to get Lamis good treatment."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wnp0vln19o,Who was Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah?,He played a key role in turning Hezbollah into the political and military force it is today.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:54.186917,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, after Israel said it had killed the 64-year-old in an airstrike on Beirut.  Nasrallah, the former leader of Lebanon's militant Shia Islamist movement, was one of the best known and most influential figures in the Middle East. Prior to his death, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for years because of fears of being assassinated by Israel. And on Saturday, Israeli military said they killed Nasrallah in a strike on the Lebanese capital. Nasrallah was a shadowy figure with close personal links to Iran who played a key role in turning Hezbollah into the political and military force it is today. He was revered by the group's supporters. Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah helped train fighters from the Palestinian armed group Hamas, as well as militias in Iraq and Yemen, and obtained missiles and rockets from Iran for use against Israel. He steered Hezbollah's evolution from a militia founded to fight Israeli troops occupying Lebanon, into a military force stronger than the Lebanese army, a powerbroker in Lebanese politics, a major provider of health, education and social services, and a key part of its backer Iran's drive for regional supremacy. Born in 1960, Hassan Nasrallah grew up in Beirut's eastern Bourj Hammoud neighbourhood, where his father Abdul Karim ran a small greengrocers. He was the eldest of nine children. He joined the Amal movement, then a Shia militia, after Lebanon descended into civil war in 1975. After a short spell in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf to attend a Shia seminary he rejoined Amal in Lebanon before he and others split from the group in 1982, shortly after Israel invaded Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants. The new group, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah. In 1985, Hezbollah officially announced its establishment by publishing an ""open letter"" that identified the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's principal enemies and called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, which it said was occupying Muslim lands. Nasrallah worked his way up through Hezbollah's ranks as the organisation grew. He said that after serving as a fighter he became its director in Baalbek, then the whole Bekaa region, followed by Beirut. He became leader of Hezbollah in 1992 at the age of 32, after his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi was assassinated in an Israeli helicopter strike. One of his first actions was to retaliate to the killing of Musawi. He ordered rocket attacks into northern Israel that killed a girl, an Israeli security officer at the Israeli embassy in Turkey was killed by a car bomb, and a suicide bomber struck the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people. Nasrallah also managed a low-intensity war with Israeli forces that ended with their withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, though he suffered a personal loss when his eldest son Hadi was killed in a firefight with Israeli troops. Following the withdrawal, Nasrallah proclaimed that Hezbollah had achieved the first Arab victory against Israel. He also vowed that Hezbollah would not disarm, saying that it considered that ""all Lebanese territory must be restored"", including the Shebaa Farms area. There was relative calm until 2006, when Hezbollah militants launched a cross-border attack in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two others kidnapped, triggering a massive Israeli response. Israeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah strongholds in the south and in Beirut's southern suburbs, while Hezbollah fired about 4,000 rockets at Israel. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day conflict, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians. Nasrallah's home and offices were targeted by Israel warplanes, but he survived unscathed. In 2009, Nasrallah issued a new political manifesto that sought to highlight Hezbollah's ""political vision"". It dropped the reference to an Islamic republic found in the 1985 document, but maintained a tough line against Israel and the US and reiterated that Hezbollah needed to keep its weapons despite a UN resolution banning them in southern Lebanon. ""People evolve. The whole world changed over the past 24 years. Lebanon changed. The world order changed,"" Nasrallah said. Four years later, Nasrallah declared that Hezbollah was entering ""a completely new phase"" of its existence by sending fighters into Syria to help its Iran-backed ally, President Bashar al-Assad, put down a rebellion. ""It is our battle, and we are up to it,"" he said. Lebanese Sunni leaders accused Hezbollah of dragging the country into Syria's war and sectarian tensions worsened dramatically. In 2019, a deep economic crisis in Lebanon triggered mass protests against a political elite long accused of corruption, waste, mismanagement and negligence. Nasrallah initially expressed sympathy with the calls for reforms, but his attitude changed as the protesters began demanding for a complete overhaul of the political system. On 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen that triggered the war in Gaza - previously sporadic fighting between Hezbollah and Israel escalated. Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. In a speech in November, Nasrallah said the Hamas attack had been ""100% Palestinian in terms of both decision and execution"" but that the firing between his group and Israel was ""very important and significant"". The group launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retaliated with air strikes and tank and artillery fire against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. In his most recent speech, Nasrallah blamed Israel for detonating thousands of pagers and radio handsets used by Hezbollah members, which killed 39 people and wounded thousands more, and said it had ""crossed all red lines"". He acknowledged the group had suffered an ""unprecedented blow"". Shortly afterwards Israel dramatically escalated attacks on Hezbollah, launching waves of bombing that killed nearly 800 people."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rd0gnv68jo,Nine killed in Israeli air strike on central Beirut,It is the first Israeli strike so close to the centre of Beirut in Lebanon in the current conflict.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:54.460187,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Nine people have been killed and 14 injured in an Israeli air strike on a building in central Beirut, Lebanese officials have said.  The multi-storey block in Bachoura housed a Hezbollah-affiliated health centre, which Israel's military said was hit in a ""precision"" attack.  This is the first Israeli strike close to Beirut's centre - just metres away from Lebanon's parliament. There were five other air strikes overnight against targets in the southern suburb of Dahieh.  It comes after the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said eight soldiers had been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, its first losses since the start of ground operations against the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Hezbollah said it had destroyed Israeli tanks during the fighting and insisted it had enough men and ammunition to push back the forces. Earlier, the IDF announced that more infantry and armoured troops had joined the operation seeking to dismantle what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Lebanese border villages. In the latest overnight strikes, three explosions were heard in Dahieh, in the city's southern suburbs - with a fourth closer to the centre. There were two further air strikes in Dahieh, which came after the IDF warned people living nearby that it was targeting what it said were facilities belonging to Hezbollah in the area of the city known to be its stronghold. Before the overnight air strikes, Lebanon's health ministry said 46 people had been killed and 85 wounded in Israeli bombings in the last 24 hours, without differentiating between civilians and combatants. A number of those killed in the central Beirut strike were rescue officers and paramedics, according to Beirut's civil defence. It also emerged a US permanent resident from the state of Michigan was among those killed in recent Israeli air strikes on Lebanon. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, 56, was in the country to care for his elderly mother, according to The Detroit News. His death was confirmed by a White House official, who said: ""His death is a tragedy, as are the deaths of many civilians in Lebanon."" Hezbollah has been weakened after two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks that have killed more than 1,200 people across Lebanon and displaced around 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries. On the second full day of their ground invasion into Lebanon, Israeli troops encountered Hezbollah fighters for the first time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that soldiers backed by aircraft had “eliminated terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure through precision-guided munitions and close-range engagements” in several southern Lebanese areas. Later, the IDF announced that eight troops had been killed in action. Most were commandos from the elite Egoz and Golani Reconnaissance units. Hezbollah said its fighters had fired ani-tank missiles at Israeli commandos, killing and wounding dozens during clashes early on Wednesday in one border village. It also said that other troops were targeted with explosives and gunfire on the outskirts of Kafr Kila, and that three Israeli Merkava tanks were destroyed by missiles near Maroun al-Ras. Hezbollah has spent years building infrastructure in southern Lebanon that includes extensive underground tunnels. It also has thousands of fighters, who know the area well. Paying tribute to the eight soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had fallen ”in the midst of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil, which seeks to destroy us”. “This will not happen, because we will stand together, and with God’s help, we will win together,” he added. Israeli air defences were also in action again a day after they repelled the vast majority of the more than 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for the Israeli air strike in Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a top Iranian commander. More than 240 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel throughout Wednesday, according to the IDF. Netanyahu insists that the ground offensive in Lebanon will degrade Hezbollah’s capability and push its fighters back, eventually allowing about 60,000 Israelis to return to their homes near the border. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden said he did not support an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian nuclear sites. He added that the US ""will be discussing with the Israelis what they're gonna do"" in response to the Iranian barrage."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjrwg9dly1o,Missile attack on Israel lays bare deep divisions among Iranians,"Social media users express a mixture of pride, uncertainty and fear after Iran's strike on Israel.",3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:54.610795,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Iranians have been expressing a mixture of pride, uncertainty and fear since their country launched a large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday night. Within minutes of the attack starting, Persian social media feeds were filled with shaky videos showing the flashes of the missiles flying overhead. Iran’s state television broadcast pictures of groups of people cheering on the streets, waving flags and chanting “Death to Israel”. But the mood was different online, with not everyone expressing support for the attack. Some shared tense scenes and heated debates about a possible war between the arch-foes, after decades of keeping their conflict largely in the shadows. The contrasting reactions laid bare the deep divisions in Iran, where there is widespread discontent at the clerical establishment and frustration over the economic troubles caused by sanctions. On one side of the debate are those who support the government's actions with nationalist pride, while on the other are those who fear war, economic collapse and further suppression of domestic reform movements. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Tuesday’s missile strike successfully targeted Israeli military and intelligence bases and that it was retaliation for recent killings of the leaders of its allies Hamas and Hezbollah. The Israeli military described the attack as ""indiscriminate"" and said that while it had been largely thwarted by air defences, there had been casualties and millions of Israelis had been sent running to bomb shelters. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Iran will pay for the ""big mistake"". For many supporters of the Iranian government, the attack represented a proud moment of defiance. “Bravo to [Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei! Bravo to the Revolutionary Guards!” shouted a young woman in a clip that went viral. Such sentiment frustrated other Iranians online. “Please distinguish between the people and the Revolutionary Guards; we are under immense pressure,” pleaded a middle-aged man in a video shared on social media. Some Iranians felt the strike was an unnecessary provocation that would only result in making their lives worse. “We have no choice but to protect our country, but we are the ones who suffer the consequences,” said a concerned resident of the capital, Tehran. In the hours after the strikes, rumours surfaced that Israel might respond by targeting Iran’s oil infrastructure, which is an important part of the country’s economy. Videos quickly surfaced showing petrol stations overwhelmed, with long queues of people as they rushed to fill up their vehicles, fearing future shortages. The missile attack has also diminished hopes for diplomatic progress with the West and other countries in the region. The election of Masoud Pezeshkian as the new president in July had sparked optimism among those with moderate views. Some people saw him as a potential bridge in easing regional tensions. But one BBC Persian viewer lamented that “this attack is another step away from diplomacy and a step closer to conflict”. “I fear this war might be used as an excuse to intensify the crackdown of us, who are fighting for freedom,” a young activist said, referring to the nationwide “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests that erupted two years ago. Many worry that a new conflict could not only undermine calls for reform, but also empower the government to further suppress internal dissent. Unlike after previous escalations, this time there’s a growing fear of a potentially strong retaliatory response from Israel. And many believe that Israel’s advanced military capabilities could bring unprecedented destruction if a full-scale war broke out. “No-one wants war, not the people, not even the officials,” said a commentator on social media. This sense of vulnerability has made the situation feel more precarious than ever before. Amid the growing tensions, some people even called for regime change. “The only way to save Iran is not through war, but through toppling the current regime,” said another BBC News Persian viewer, urging the West to support Iranians in their struggle against the government. However, many believe the country’s future should be decided internally, free from any foreign intervention, to avoid the potential chaos that outside interference might cause."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2kyydjrlyo,"Three Hamas leaders killed months ago, IDF says","The IDF says the men, including the head of the Hamas government, were killed in a strike on northern Gaza.",3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:01.997391,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced that, three months ago, it killed three senior Hamas leaders in Gaza. Among them is Rawhi Mushtaha, identified by the IDF as the head of the Hamas government in Gaza, along with Sameh al-Siraj and Sami Oudeh, who were responsible for security in Hamas. The IDF said they were hiding in an underground compound in northern Gaza and were killed by air strikes. Israel said Hamas did not announce the deaths ""in order to prevent loss of morale and functioning of its terror operatives"". In a statement, the IDF said Rawhi Mushtaha was ""one of Hamas's most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas's force deployment"".  The deaths announced on Thursday add to the list of prominent Hamas leaders killed in the last year, since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. In August, the Israeli military said it shot dead Hamas's leader Wissam Khazem, during a major operation in the West Bank. Separately, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in the Iranian capital, Tehran, in July. Iran blamed the incident on Israel, but Israeli officials did not claim it. The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) later said that Iran's missile attack on Israel on Tuesday was retaliation for what it called the ""violation of Iran’s sovereignty and the martyrdom” of Haniyeh."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw5v077nyjo,Yazidi woman rescued from Gaza after decade in captivity,The woman had been kidnapped from Iraq aged 11 by the Islamic State group and trafficked to Gaza.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:02.180563,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A Yazidi woman who was kidnapped aged 11 in Iraq by the Islamic State group and subsequently taken to Gaza has been rescued after more than a decade in captivity there, officials from Israel, the US and Iraq said. The Yazidis are a religious minority who mostly live in Iraq and Syria. In 2014 the Islamic State group overran the Yazidi community in Sinjar in northern Iraq, massacring thousands of men, and enslaving girls and women. The Israeli military said the now 21-year-old's captor in Gaza had been killed during the ongoing war between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas, probably as a result of an air strike. The woman, identified as Fawzia Amin Sido, then fled to another place in Gaza.  The Israeli military said Ms Sido was eventually freed during a ""complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors"" and taken to Iraq via Israel and Jordan. Iraqi foreign ministry official Silwan Sinjaree told Reuters that several earlier attempts to rescue her over the course of about four months failed because of the security situation in Gaza. Mr Sinjaree said Ms Sido was in good physical condition, but had been traumatised by her time in captivity and by the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Video shared by Canadian philanthropist Steve Maman showed Ms Sido reuniting with her family in Iraq. Posting on X, Mr Maman said: ""I made a promise to Fawzia the Yazidi who was hostage of Hamas in Gaza that I would bring her back home to her mother in Sinjar. ""To her it seemed surreal and impossible but not to me, my only enemy was time.  Our team reunited her moments ago with her mother and family in Sinjar."" The Islamic State group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. In August 2014, IS militants swept through Iraq's north-western Sinjar region, which is the homeland of the Yazidi religious minority. In numerous Yazidi villages, the population was rounded up. Men and boys over the age of 14 were separated from women and girls. The men were then led away and shot, while the women were abducted as the ""spoils of war"". Some of the Yazidi girls and women who later escaped from captivity described being openly sold or handed over into sexual slavery as ""gifts"" to IS members.  The Islamic State group is believed to have killed more than 3,000 Yazidis and captured 6,000 others in total.  The UN said IS committed genocide as well as multiple crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Yazidis. Iraqi authorities say more than 3,500 members of the community have been rescued or freed and about 2,600 people remain missing."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxgkrv9j7no,Eight Israeli troops killed in fighting with Hezbollah inside Lebanon,They are the Israeli army's first losses since the start of the ground invasion against Hezbollah.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:02.294585,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel’s military says eight of its soldiers have been killed in combat in southern Lebanon, its first losses since the start of the ground invasion against the armed group Hezbollah. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said it had destroyed Israeli tanks during the fighting and insisted it had enough men and ammunition to push back the forces. Earlier, the Israeli military announced that more infantry and armoured troops had joined the operation seeking to dismantle what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Lebanese border villages. Meanwhile, at least five people died and eight were wounded in an Israeli military air strike in the Bachoura area in central Beirut, Lebanese officials said.  The multi-storey building targeted housed a Hezbollah-affiliated health centre and is just metres away from Lebanon's parliament and United Nations Regional Headquarters. This is the first Israeli strike so close to the centre of Beirut, with other attacks overnight hitting the southern suburb of Dahieh.  Earlier on Wednesday evening, Lebanon's health ministry said 46 people had been killed and 85 wounded in Israeli strikes on the country in the last 24 hours, without differentiating between civilians and combatants. Hezbollah has been weakened after two weeks of Israeli strikes and other attacks that have killed more than 1,200 people across Lebanon and displaced around 1.2 million, according to Lebanese authorities. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah attacks. Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries. On the second full day of their ground invasion into Lebanon, Israeli troops encountered Hezbollah fighters for the first time. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Wednesday that soldiers backed by aircraft had “eliminated terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure through precision-guided munitions and close-range engagements” in several southern Lebanese areas. Later, the IDF announced that eight troops had been killed in action. Most were commandos from the elite Egoz and Golani Reconnaissance units. Six were reportedly ambushed by Hezbollah fighters and another two were killed by mortar fire. Hezbollah said dozens of its fighters had fired ani-tank missiles at Israeli commandos, killing and wounding dozens of them, during clashes early on Wednesday in one border village. It also claimed that other troops were targeted with explosives and gunfire on the outskirts of Kafr Kila, and that three Israeli Merkava tanks were destroyed by missiles near Maroun al-Ras. Hezbollah has spent years building infrastructure in southern Lebanon that includes extensive underground tunnels. It also has thousands of fighters, who know the area well. Paying tribute to the eight soldiers, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had fallen ”in the midst of a tough war against Iran’s axis of evil, which seeks to destroy us”. “This will not happen, because we will stand together, and with God’s help, we will win together,” he added. Israeli air defences were also in action again a day after they repelled the vast majority of the more than 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel on Tuesday night in retaliation for the Israeli air strike in Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a top Iranian commander. More than 240 rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel throughout Wednesday, according to the IDF. Netanyahu insists that the ground offensive in Lebanon will degrade Hezbollah’s capability and push its fighters back, eventually allowing about 60,000 Israelis to return to their homes near the border. Meanwhile US President Joe Biden said he did not support an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian nuclear sites. He added that the US ""will be discussing with the Israelis what they're gonna do"" in response to the Iranian barrage. The overnight air strikes in Beirut follows heavy strikes in Dahieh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the previous night after the IDF issued several evacuation orders for areas around buildings it said were linked to the group. On Wednesday morning, a BBC team was taken there on a media tour organised by Hezbollah to show the recent destruction. Once a bustling district, Dahieh now looks like a ghost town. Shops have been closed, streets are deserted and most of its residents have left. One of the sites on the tour was the headquarters of Sirat TV, which was hit on Monday. It was flattened, and nearby buildings were severely damaged, an indication of the power of the attack. There was still smoke billowing from the rubble and a heavy smell in the air, while the sound of Israeli drones flying overhead could be heard. There were several posters with the face of Hassan Nasrallah. One said: “None of our banners shall fall.” Hezbollah says Israel has been hitting civilian buildings, not those used for military purposes. Israel accused the group of hiding weapons and ammunition in residential areas. US and Israeli officials believe half of Hezbollah’s arsenal has been destroyed and its leadership has been dismantled. But Mohammed Afif, a Hezbollah spokesman, remained defiant. “I can say the resistance is swiftly recovering its strength,” he told the BBC. “The leadership of the resistance is well, its command-and-control structure is well, and its supply of rockets is well.” “God willing, we will inflict defeat upon the Israeli enemy when they dare cross into Lebanon.” As well as Dahieh, many people have fled two other regions where Hezbollah has a strong presence - the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. Beirut’s Martyr’s Square has become a place where dozens of families have gathered, with nowhere to go. Some tents have been set up near concrete walls, but many are sleeping on the steps of the nearby Mohammad al-Amin Mosque or on mattresses on the ground. Mohammed, who is 55, arrived five days ago with his wife, his son and seven grandchildren. They were trying to move to a shelter, he said, but had not been able to find a place. “We’ve got nowhere to go,” he said. Thanks to donations, they have been able to eat. But they are struggling without diapers, milk, and medicine. Next to him, 26-year-old Mohammed had arrived with his three children. He said he worked in Dahieh but that he lost his job because all its shops were closed. “There’s no work,” he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dv18l03n1o,"Israeli strike on Gaza school that killed 22 targeted one Hamas figure, BBC told",Thirteen children and a pregnant woman were among the victims of the air strike on 21 September.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:02.594463,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting An Israeli air strike that killed multiple children at a former school twelve days ago had been targeting one local Hamas figure, the BBC has been told. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a Hamas ""command and control centre"" had been embedded inside the compound in Gaza City, which it targeted in a ""precise strike"" on 21 September. It killed 22 people, including 13 children and six women, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The school, closed during the war, had been housing displaced people, the health ministry said. One young girl, Amal, told the BBC she had been inside the school building when it was hit and saw bodies “torn apart”. “What have we done as children? We wake up and go to sleep terrified,"" she said. “At least protect the schools; we don’t have schools or homes - where do we go?” Sources have told the BBC that one of those killed was a local Hamas figure, meaning many civilians died due to a single main target. Huda Alhadad lost two children – son Muhammad, 13, and daughter Hanan, 12. “I was coming from the hallway when the missile fell. I came and found my husband screaming, saying, 'My children, my children, my children,'"" she told the BBC. “I asked him, 'Where are they?' I searched for them and found them under the rubble.” In the twelve days after the air strike, at least eight more fatal strikes took place in Gaza on school buildings housing displaced families – the latest in a series of attacks on such buildings, which provide little safety. Unicef has said more than 50% of schools used as shelters in Gaza had been directly hit during the current war, with “devastating consequences for children and families”. In each of the latest strikes, the IDF released public statements saying the former schools had contained Hamas terrorists or “command and control” centres. In their public statement about the 21 September strike, the IDF incorrectly named the former school they hit – Al-Zeitoun C – instead identifying another one nearby, Al-Falah. We confirmed that Al-Zeitoun C was the one that had been hit by speaking to local people, as well as comparing videos of the attack aftermath with satellite imagery. The Hamas-run Gazan authorities also named it as Al-Zeitoun C. The relevant area is in the Al-Zeitoun neighbourhood and includes four distinct schools: Al-Falah, and Al-Zeitoun A, B, and C. When asked about incorrectly naming the school, the IDF refused to comment. It would also not comment on who was targeted. The Hamas-run government media office said the Israeli military had committed a “horrific massacre” by bombing Al-Zeitoun C school, which shelters displaced people. It said that, in addition to those killed, the attack also caused severe injuries, including nine children who needed limbs amputating. Dr Amjad Eliwa, an emergency physician who treated those injured in the strike, described over 30 injuries reaching his hospital, saying they were “mostly among children and women, with cases of amputations and very severe injuries”. He described one of those who died as a woman who was six months pregnant. This was corroborated by images of a foetus at the site of the strike, and residents said the dead woman was Barah Deraawi, who died along with two young daughters, Israa and Iman.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70w1j0l488o,What we know about Iran's missile attack on Israel,Iran has launched a missile attack against Israel in retaliation for the killing of militant leaders allied to Tehran.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:02.764406,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Iran launched almost 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on Tuesday night. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern Israel. The only person reported to have been killed was a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank. It was Iran’s second such attack on Israel this year, after it launched about 300 missiles and drones in April. Here's what we know so far. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the attack involved more than 180 missiles, which tallied with Iranian state media reports saying that about 200 missiles were launched. The US said the attack was “nearly twice the scope” of what happened in April. Sirens sounded as Israel’s entire 10 million population was told to head into bomb shelters at about 19:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday. Social media videos verified by the BBC showed missiles flying over the densely populated cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem less than 15 minutes later. Explosions could be heard overhead as air defences intercepted the incoming missiles. The footage also showed several missiles hitting areas around the Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert and the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency near Tel Aviv. “There were a small number of hits in the centre of Israel, and other hits in southern Israel,” said IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. “The majority of the incoming missiles were intercepted by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States.” The Israeli military confirmed on Wednesday some of its air bases had been hit during the attack, but said no weapons, aircraft or critical infrastructure was damaged and the air force's operational abilities were not affected. Iranian state media cited the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) as saying the missiles hit Nevatim, Hatzerim and Tel Nof airbases, as well as Israeli tanks in Netzarim - a reference to an Israeli military corridor in central Gaza - and gas installations in the southern city of Ashkelon. The semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran had for the first time used Fattah hypersonic missiles that it claimed ""cannot be intercepted"", as well as Emad and Qadr ballistic missiles. However, the IDF said the barrage did not include any hypersonic missiles, according to Israeli media. On Wednesday, the IDF said several air force bases were damaged in the missile attack, but that no aircraft were damaged, according to Israeli media reports. “Only administrative buildings and peripheral components were hit,” the IDF was quoted as saying, while adding that “upcoming missions remain unaffected"". The IDF also reportedly said that damage to infrastructure and property in civilian areas was “only minor” and was likely to have been caused by shrapnel from intercepted missiles. Just north of Tel Aviv on Wednesday, close to the Mossad’s headquarters, a BBC correspondent found several badly damaged cars and a pile of earth next to a road where a missile impact was said to have caused a crater between 8m and 10m deep. The nearby municipality of Hod HaSharon also said about 100 houses were damaged by a missile explosion and shrapnel. ""This was a very powerful impact with a huge risk of claiming human lives,"" the municipality said. And a video released by the IDF showed the head of its Home Front Command visiting a school that was hit by a missile in the Gedera area, just to the east of Ashkelon, causing extensive damage to a classroom. Israel’s Magen David Adom ambulance service paramedics treated two people with light injuries from shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, as well as some people with minor injuries caused by falling as they moved to shelters. However, the Palestinian Civil Defence authority said a Palestinian man was killed when he was hit by a falling missile fragment in the West Bank city of Jericho. CCTV footage showed the rear half of a large, black missile plummeting directly on to a man as he walks along a road at night. It was not clear if the missile had been intercepted. The New York Times identified him as Sameh al-Asali, a 37-year-old Palestinian construction worker from Gaza who had been sheltering in Jericho since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October. The IDF has not provided details about how the missiles were shot down, besides saying that Israeli and US-led forces were involved and that Israeli air defences “operated impressively, with high rates of interception”. It also did not say exactly how many were intercepted, explaining that it wanted to avoid “giving Iran and Hezbollah information that will help them learn lessons”. The IDF claimed that 99% of the Iranian projectiles launched in April’s attack were intercepted. Israel has a sophisticated system of air defences, the best-known of which is the Iron Dome. It is designed to intercept short-range rockets of the sort fired by Hamas and Hezbollah. While it was used to defend against some elements of Iran's last attack in April, other elements of the country's ""layered"" defence systems probably did the bulk of the work on Tuesday. David’s Sling - a joint US-Israeli manufactured system - is used to intercept medium to long-range rockets, as well as ballistic and cruise missiles. And when it comes to long-range ballistic missiles, which fly outside the Earth’s atmosphere, Israel has the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 interceptors. The Pentagon said two US Navy destroyers deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean fired a dozen interceptors as part of the efforts to defend Israel, but that it was not known whether they took down any of the missiles. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said British forces had ""played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation”. But the BBC understands that British military jets did not shoot down any Iranian missiles. Verified footage also showed missile interceptions over the Jordanian capital, Amman. The Arab kingdom’s forces also shot down a number of missiles during Iran's last attack in April. The IRGC said in a statement that the missile barrage was retaliation for what it called the ""violation of Iran’s sovereignty and the martyrdom” of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed by an explosion in Tehran in July that Iranian officials blamed on Israel, but Israeli officials did not claim. The statement described the barrage as having been ""in line with the legitimate right of the nation to defend itself”. It also said the attack was in response to the Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut last Friday that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, the operations commander of the IRGC’s overseas arm, the Quds Force. A senior Iranian official told Reuters news agency the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had personally given the order for Tuesday's missile attack.  The escalation also came hours after Israeli troops began an invasion of southern Lebanon to remove what the military said were ""Hezbollah terror targets” in border villages that posed a threat to residents of northern Israel. Israel has gone on the offensive against the Shia Islamist political and military organisation after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war with Hamas in Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran and designated as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US, UK and others. Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and seeks its eradication. It has spent years building a network of armed groups across the Middle East, known as the “Axis of Resistance”, which are opposed to Israel and the US. Israel believes that Iran poses an existential threat and has spent years engaged in a shadow war with Iran that has is now increasingly out in the open. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday night that Iran’s missile attack “failed”, having been “thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defence array”. “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it,” he added. “The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies.” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also vowed vengeance. ""Iran has not learned a simple lesson - those who attack the state of Israel pay a heavy price,"" he said in a statement. US President Joe Biden reaffirmed US support for Israel after the missile attack, describing it as ""defeated and ineffective"". Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin also condemned what he called ""this outrageous act of aggression by Iran"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK stood with Israel and recognised her ""right to self-defence"". France and Japan also condemned Iran's attack, but also called on all parties to avoid further escalation. The US told Israel before the attack that it had intelligence indicating that Iran was preparing to launch ballistic missiles imminently, which allowed the IDF to warn Israeli civilians to be prepared to seek shelter. However, US officials said after the attack that they had received no warning from the Iranian government. Iran’s mission to the UN also said in a statement: “No notice was given to the United States prior to our response.” The Wall Street Journal citing Arab officials in the region as saying that Iran “telegraphed” to Arab countries on Monday night that it was going to launch an attack similar in scale to April’s. The officials also said Israel had sent clear messages back to Iran that it would respond to any attack on Israeli territory with a strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear or oil facilities. The IDF’s Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said: “We will choose when to exact the price and demonstrate our precise and surprising offensive capabilities, in accordance with the directive of the political echelon."" Axos cited Israeli officials as saying that Israel’s response would be “significant” and that it could target oil production facilities inside Iran and other strategic sites. Some analysts suggested that Iran’s nuclear facilities could also be targeted.  President Biden said the US was “fully supportive of Israel” and that he would discuss a response with Israel’s prime minister.  But Biden made clear that he saw any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites as off limits. Asked by reporters whether he would support such an attack, he said: ""The answer is no."" The IRGC warned that Iran’s response would be ""crushing"" if Israel dared to retaliate. Israel responded to April’s attack by launching a missile that hit an air defence battery at an Iranian airbase, following Western calls for restraint."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxgyzq7z2ro,Israel launches ground invasion in Lebanon,"The Israel Defense Forces says it has launched ""limited, localised and targeted ground raids"" in southern Lebanon.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:03.022306,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon, in what it has described as ""limited, localised and targeted"" raids against Hezbollah. Lebanese civilians are being warned not to use vehicles to travel south across the Litani river, located 20 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon border, and residents in around 25 villages have been told to evacuate and head north. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the operation is aimed at the Iran-backed group's ""infrastructure"", which it says poses ""an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel"". An Israeli senior security official told the BBC earlier that ground forces had only ventured a ""very close walking distance"" into Lebanon, but Hezbollah deny claims that troops are in the country. The militant group said its fighters were ""ready for a direct confrontation"" but there had been no direct clashes between them and Israeli forces, a claim confirmed to the BBC by an Israeli source.  Hezbollah has also claimed to have fired at the headquarters of Mossad, the international arm of Israel's intelligence service, in Tel Aviv.  Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon are continuing. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant previously implied the army was ready for a ground operation, telling troops near the Lebanese border Israel was prepared to use forces ""from the air, sea and land"" to target Hezbollah. In a statement posted on X at 02:00 local time on Tuesday morning, the IDF confirmed troops had moved across the border following a build-up of tanks and other armour in northern Israel. The Lebanese army is pulling back troops stationed on its southern border to at least 5km (3 miles) north, according to Reuters news agency, which cited a Lebanese security source. Lebanon's prime minister, Najib Mikati, said on Tuesday that his country was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases"" in its history. Around one million people had been displaced across Lebanon since Israeli air strikes began last month, he added. Speaking during a meeting with United Nations organisations, Mikati issued an ""urgent call"" for more aid to help support them. The IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee has also listed 25 villages in southern Lebanon, telling residents there to evacuate immediately. He added: ""Any home used by Hezbollah for its military needs is expected to be targeted."" On Monday, Gallant told Israeli troops at the border that Israel's military would use all ""the means at our disposal"" to allow displaced people to return home in the north of the country. In a short video, he said the ""elimination"" of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on Friday ""is a very important step, but it is not everything"". He added that ""everything that needs to be done - will be done"" and that ""we will use all the forces from the air, sea and land"". The Israeli government has pledged to make it safe for tens of thousands of its citizens to return to their homes after nearly a year of cross-border fighting, which began with Hezbollah firing rockets at the start of the war in Gaza.  The Lebanese armed group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and other countries - is known to have extensive tunnel networks as well as bunkers and other military infrastructure just over the border from Israel. Hezbollah's deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem said the group - which is thought to have tens of thousands of well-trained fighters - was ready for an Israeli ground offensive. He described their attacks on Israel so far as the ""minimum"", adding that the battle could be long. Hezbollah - which is backed by Iran - has experienced mass casualties from exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, a wave of assassinations of its military commanders and devastating air strikes which have killed civilians, as well as the use of bunker-busting bombs in Beirut, which killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday.  Explosions lit up the night sky on Monday as airstrikes hit Hezbollah’s stronghold of Dahieh, in Beirut's southern suburbs, near the airport. The attacks came shortly after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate buildings it said were linked to the group. In southern Lebanon, there were reports of heavy shelling in the border town of Aita al-Shaab. And near the city of Sidon, officials say a strike hit a building in a crowded Palestinian refugee camp, the first time it has been attacked in this conflict. Lebanese officials say more than 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks, while around a million may now be displaced. On Monday, US President Joe Biden said ""we should have a ceasefire now"". ""I'm more aware than you might know and I'm comfortable with them stopping,"" Biden told reporters when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy spoke to his US counterpart Antony Blinken on Monday, with the US State Department saying they discussed efforts to resolve the conflict. Both men stressed the need for a ceasefire and that the hostages taken by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas in the 7 October attack on Israel need to be returned home. The European Union's member states have called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said ""any further military intervention would dramatically aggravate the situation and it has to be avoided"". Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas have both confirmed the killing of the head of Hamas in Lebanon, Fateh Sherif Abu el-Amin, in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon. Israel's military said Sherif was ""responsible for co-ordinating Hamas's terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives"". Another Israeli strike in the central Beirut neighbourhood of Kola early on Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Palestinian armed group said in a statement. The statement named those killed as military security chief Mohammad Abdel-Aal, military commander Imad Odeh and fighter Abdel Rahman Abdel-Aal. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ek1ejj11ko,Middle East conflict: How will it end?,Talk of how the Israel-Palestine conflict could be resolved has been drowned out amid the increased fighting.,7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:27:03.145342,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A year ago, the images were searing. With Israel still reeling from the worst attack in its history and Gaza already under devastating bombardment, it felt like a turning point. The Israel-Palestine conflict, largely absent from our screens for years, had exploded back into view. It seemed to take almost everyone by surprise. The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had famously declared just a week before the attacks: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” A year on, the region is in flames. More than 41,000 Palestinians are dead. Two million Gazans have been displaced. In the West Bank, another 600 Palestinians have been killed. In Lebanon, another one million people are displaced and more than 2,000 dead. More than 1,200 Israelis were killed on that first day. Since then, Israel has lost 350 more soldiers in Gaza. Two hundred thousand Israelis have been forced from their homes close to Gaza and along the volatile northern border with Lebanon. Around 50 soldiers and civilians have been killed by Hezbollah rockets. Across the Middle East, others have joined the fight. Dogged US efforts to prevent the crisis from escalating, involving presidential visits, countless diplomatic missions and the deployment of vast military resources, have all come to nothing. Rockets have been fired from far away in Iraq and Yemen. And mortal enemies Israel and Iran have exchanged blows too, with more almost certain to come. Washington has rarely looked less influential. As the conflict has spread and metastasised, its origins have faded from view, like the scene of a car crash receding in the rear view mirror of a juggernaut hurtling towards even bigger disasters. The lives of Gazans, before and after October 7, have been almost forgotten as the media breathlessly anticipates “all-out war” in the Middle East. Some Israelis whose lives were turned upside down that terrible day are feeling similarly neglected. “We have been pushed aside,” Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage Nimrod Cohen, told Israel’s Kan news last week. Mr Cohen said he held Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for a “pointless war that has pitted all possible enemies against us”. “He is doing everything, with great success, to turn the event of October 7 into a minor event,” he said. Not all Israelis share Mr Cohen’s particular perspective. Many now see the Hamas attacks of a year ago as the opening salvo of a wider campaign by Israel’s enemies to destroy the Jewish state. The fact that Israel has struck back - with exploding pagers, targeted assassinations, long-range bombing raids and the sort of intelligence-led operations the country has long prided itself on – has restored some of the self-confidence the country lost a year ago. “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach,” Mr Netanyahu confidently declared last week. The prime minister’s poll ratings were rock bottom for months after October 7. Now he can see them creeping up again. A license, perhaps, for more bold action? But where’s it all going? “None of us know when the music is going to stop and where everybody will be at that point,” Simon Gass, Britain’s former ambassador to Iran, told the BBC’s Today Podcast on Thursday.  The US is still involved, even if the visit to Israel of US Central Command (Centcom) chief Gen. Michael Kurilla feels more like crisis management than an exploration of diplomatic off-ramps. With a presidential election now just four weeks away and the Middle East more politically toxic than ever before, this doesn’t feel like a moment for bold new American initiatives. For now, the immediate challenge is simply to prevent a wider regional conflagration. There’s a general assumption, among her allies, that Israel has the right - even the duty - to respond to last week’s ballistic missile attack by Iran. No Israelis were killed in the attack and Iran appeared to be aiming at military and intelligence targets, but Mr Netanyahu has nevertheless promised a harsh response. After weeks of stunning tactical success, Israel’s prime minister seems to harbour grand ambitions. In a direct address to the Iranian people, he hinted that regime change was coming in Tehran. “When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, everything will be different,” he said. For some observers, his rhetoric carried uncomfortable echoes of the case made by American neoconservatives in the run up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. But for all the danger of the moment, fragile guardrails do still exist. The Iranian regime may dream of a world without Israel, but it knows that it’s far too weak to take on the region’s only superpower, especially at a time when Hezbollah and Hamas - its allies and proxies in the so-called “axis of resistance” - are being crushed. And Israel, which would dearly like to get rid of the threat posed by Iran, also knows that it cannot do this alone, despite its recent successes. Regime change is not on Joe Biden’s agenda, nor that of his vice president, Kamala Harris. As for Donald Trump, the one time he seemed poised to attack Iran - after Tehran shot down a US surveillance drone in June 2019 - the former president backed down at the last moment (although he did order the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, seven months later). Few would have imagined, a year ago, that the Middle East was heading for its most perilous moment in decades. But looked at through that same juggernaut’s rear view mirror, the past 12 months seem to have followed a terrible logic. With so much wreckage now strewn all across the road, and events still unfolding at an alarming pace, policy makers - and the rest of us - are struggling to keep up. As the conflict that erupted in Gaza grinds on into a second year, all talk of the “day after” – how Gaza will be rehabilitated and governed when the fighting finally ends – has ceased, or been drowned out by the din of a wider war. So too has any meaningful discussion of a resolution of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians, the conflict which got us here in the first place. At some point, when Israel feels it has done enough damage to Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel and Iran have both had their say - assuming this doesn’t plunge the region into an even deeper crisis - and the US presidential election is over, diplomacy may get another chance. But right now, that all feels a very long way off. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98yklj023xo,Couple killed by Hezbollah rocket fire in northern Israel,They were the first civilians killed by Hezbollah since the conflict with Israel escalated two weeks ago.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:27:03.276625,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Two civilians have been killed and several others wounded after the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah fired at least 150 rockets into northern Israel. Paramedics said a man and a woman in their 40s were fatally wounded by shrapnel in the border town of Kiryat Shmona. They were a couple who had been out walking their dog along a wooded street. Hezbollah said it had targeted Israeli forces in Kiryat Shmona, which most residents have evacuated after a year of cross-border fighting. These were the first Israeli civilians killed by Hezbollah since the conflict escalated two weeks ago, when Israel launched an intense air campaign targeting the Iran-backed group before invading southern Lebanon. The rocket or fragments that hit Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday also sparked several fires. We could smell the fires burning before we saw them. In one street, neighbours watched as three teams of firefighters tackled plumes of smoke from a house where a rocket had landed. Katy Krelshtein watched in disbelief from the other side of the road - the house next door belonged to her father. “I saw red,” she replied, when I asked for her reaction. “It’s gone beyond fear now - it’s just anger.” Rockets have been a daily reality for a year now in Kiryat Shmona, and many people there said they wanted their military to do whatever it takes to make them stop. As we arrived and began filming, there were several more rocket alerts and interceptions. This close to the border, residents have just seconds to reach a shelter. We watched as one large barrage of more than 20 rockets, followed by what looked like a missile, were all intercepted in the sky overhead - part of what the Israeli military said were 90 projectiles launched from Lebanon in a single eight-minute window. Earlier on Wednesday, we were in another town to the west, where the border cuts straight down the hill overlooking it. Burned patches of forest mark where artillery and rockets have landed. In the deserted streets below, the sound of gunfire from across the hill echoed around empty houses. Shelley Barkan, one of very few who have stayed there, said there were sometimes eight or nine rocket alerts each day now. “I’ve got pieces of rockets in my garden,” she said. “Their aim is to murder us, to kill us, to send Israel to the sea, and our aim is to defend ourselves.” She showed us the catering hall where she helps prepare food for the local soldiers. While we were there, we heard a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon over our heads towards Israeli towns further south. Minutes later, rockets landed in the coastal city of Haifa, wounding another five people, including a teenage boy. Israel has gone on the offensive after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks. The hostilities have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel. The military says the aim of its ground invasion, which began nine days ago, is to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure along the border that it says poses an imminent threat to Israeli communities. There were reports of intense battles between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters in several southern Lebanese areas on Wednesday. Hezbollah said its fighters had pushed back Israeli troops advancing towards the western village of Labbouneh, attacked others inside the eastern village of Maroun al-Ras, and shelled troops near Mays al-Jabal, which is near Kiryat Shmona. The Israeli military, meanwhile, said its troops and aircraft had destroyed more than 100 Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon over the past day. The Lebanese health ministry said at least four people had been killed and 10 injured in an Israeli air strike on the village of Wardaniyeh, to the north-east of the coastal city of Sidon. The state-run National News Agency reported that the strike hit a hotel housing displaced families."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9jzv4deg9o,'The country is lost': Fear and uncertainty in Lebanon as Israel invades,Many in Lebanon believe the country has been dragged into a war it hasn't chosen to fight.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:11.934075,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"For the past few days, there was a feeling in Lebanon that an Israeli ground invasion into the country’s south was almost inevitable as Israel indicated its campaign against Hezbollah would not stop with the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, who, for three decades, was the face of the group. Now that this has been confirmed, with what the Israeli military describes as a “limited, localised and targeted” operation, the fear is that this could be the start of something wider.  History shows that it is easy for Israeli troops to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. “The country is lost,” a Lebanese friend texted me. Another one wrote: “If you ask me what’s coming, my answer is it will be very long and hard days are coming”. A third said: “We just need to hope for the best.” There is a feeling that history is repeating itself, and uncertainty about what happens next. It remains unclear whether Hezbollah can still organise any significant and co-ordinated response. It continues to fire rockets at Israel, but not at the same intensity. Meanwhile, this is a country under pressure, struggling with the sheer number of casualties from Israeli air strikes and one million people who have already been displaced. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group armed and financed by Iran, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others, but is more than just a militia in Lebanon. It is also a political party with representation in parliament, and a social movement, engrained in Lebanese society, with significant support. Powerful and influential, Hezbollah, which means Party of God, is often described as a state within a state in Lebanon. It has been weakened by two weeks of unrelenting Israeli air strikes and high-profile assassinations, but has not been defeated. In a defiant speech on Monday, the Hezbollah number two, Naim Qassem, said its fighters were ready to resist any Israeli invasion. Before this latest escalation, Hezbollah’s armed wing, which includes a vast arsenal of weapons and thousands of battled-hardened fighters, was said to be stronger than the Lebanese army, and the country’s authorities have little say - if any - over the group’s actions. For almost a year, as Hezbollah carried out near-daily cross-border attacks on Israel, many outside its support base in Lebanon feared that this country, already struggling to recover from years of successive crises, was being dragged into a conflict that it has not chosen to fight. The economy has essentially collapsed, and political impasse means the country has been without a president for almost two years. Here, there are still memories of the last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, when parts of southern Lebanon and Dahieh, the group’s base in Beirut’s southern suburbs, were flattened. Hezbollah’s rivals will not be disappointed to see a weakened group who, many say, is interested in defending its own interests - and those of its main supporter, Iran.  Hezbollah is the most powerful group in the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance of factions across the Middle East supported by Iran that also includes the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq and Syria. Having a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon, right next to Israel, has always been vital for Iran, part of its deterrence against any Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities. Yesterday, outside a building in central Beirut hit by an Israeli strike, a resident told me: “I’m against Israel, who is killing us, but I’m against Iran, who is killing us as well”. This is, obviously, rejected by Hezbollah supporters. “We shed tears of blood over the [Israeli] strike against Nasrallah, may God grant him paradise… He’s irreplaceable,” one of them said, after being forced to flee Dahieh. “We don’t fear [Israel]. We’re still standing.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o,Israeli strikes may have displaced million people - Lebanon PM,"Lebanese PM Najib Mikati says it is ""the largest displacement movement that may have happened"" in his country.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.130275,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's continuing air strikes may have already forced as many as one million people from their homes across Lebanon, the country's prime minister has said. ""It is the largest displacement movement that may have happened,"" Najib Mikati said. Lebanon's health ministry reported more than 50 people killed in Sunday's strikes - two days after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel.  In a separate development, Israel said it had carried out ""large-scale"" air strikes on military targets of the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen. Hezbollah confirmed on Sunday that top military commander Ali Karaki and a senior cleric, Sheikh Nabil Qaouk, had also been killed in the Israeli air strikes. ""We need to keep hitting Hezbollah hard,"" Israel's military chief of staff Herzi Halevi said. Another Israeli strike in the central Beirut neighbourhood of Kola early on Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the group said in a statement.  The PFLP is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, a coalition recognised at the UN as the official representative of the Palestinians. The group is also considered a terrorist organisation by both the US and EU.  The statement named those killed as military security chief Mohammad Abdel-Aal, military commander Imad Odeh, and fighter Abdel Rahman Abdel-Aal. Lebanon's Prime Minister Mikati said the wave of air strikes had forced people to flee from Beirut and other parts of the country, including the southern border areas. The local authorities are struggling to assist everyone in need, with shelters and hospitals under growing pressure, BBC correspondents in Lebanon report. Aya Ayoub, aged 25, told the BBC she had to flee her house in Beirut’s southern Tahweetet al-Ghadir suburb with her family of six as it was too dangerous to stay. Around her house, she said, ""all the buildings are completely destroyed"", and she was currently staying with another 16 people in a house in Beirut. ""We left on Friday and had no place to go. We stayed until 02:00 in the streets until a group of people helped us get into a residential building that was under construction. We are living on candles at night, and have to get water and food from outside”. Sara Tohmaz, a 34-year-old journalist, told the BBC she had left her house near Beirut with her mother and two siblings last Friday. It took them almost 10 hours to reach Jordan through Syria by car, she said. “I think we are lucky enough to have a place to stay in Jordan, where my mother’s relatives are based. We don’t know what will happen next, and don’t know when we will be back,"" Tohmaz added. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then hundreds of people, including many Hezbollah fighters, have been killed, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Also on Sunday, Israel said it carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, striking power plants and a port in Ras Isa and Hudaydah. Footage later emerged showing a huge explosion at the port. Israel says it targeted the sites in response to recent missile attacks from the Houthis, as well as to destroy facilities being used to transport Iranian weapons. The Houthis, a Shia group controlling large areas of Yemen, condemned the Israeli strikes as a ""brutal aggression"". They said four people were killed and 33 injured, vowing revenge.  There are mounting international fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Washington warned Israel against an all-out war with Hezbollah or Iran, saying a major conflict would leave Israelis unable to return to their homes in the north."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20jx85vxwdo,Israel striking Hezbollah with ‘full force’ despite ceasefire calls,"More than 600 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon since Monday, health officials say.",27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.525832,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the country’s military to continue fighting with “full force” against the armed group Hezbollah, despite calls from the US and other allies for a ceasefire. Lebanon's health ministry said at least 92 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, with hundreds more killed since the strikes escalated on Monday. Hezbollah has confirmed that an air strike on an apartment building in the south of Beirut killed the head of its drone unit, Mohammad Surur. Fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah are at a high, after a dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since Monday. The increase in hostilities prompted a 12-strong bloc - including the US, UK and EU - to propose a three week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah on Wednesday. The proposal was initially met with hope after Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said his country was “open to ideas”. But by Thursday it had been roundly rejected by Israeli politicians. Landing in New York for the UN General Assembly, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would “not stop” in Lebanon until it reached all of its goals, “chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.” The White House later said the ceasefire proposal had been “coordinated” with Israel, despite Mr Netanyahu's assertion, just hours later, that his country would continue fighting. Early on Friday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement seeking to ""clarify a few points"" due to ""a lot of misreporting around the US-led ceasefire initiative"". ""Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,"" the statement said. ""Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes,"" it said, adding it ""appreciates the US efforts in this regard"".  Discussions will continue in the days ahead, the statement finished.  Speaking in New York, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called for an ""immediate ceasefire to provide space for a diplomatic settlement"" to resolve the conflict in Lebanon. He said the conflict could spill over into a war ""no one can control"". Around 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from the north of the country since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza, began nearly a year ago. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. Through Thursday, the Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s south and in the Bekaa Valley in the country’s east. It also struck infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border, which it said was to cut weapons supplies to the group. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had fired 50 rockets towards the city of Kiryat Ata, and 80 missiles towards the city of Safed, both in northern Israel. The Israeli army said it intercepted a missile that was fired from Yemen after sirens and explosions were heard. Israel’s military chief Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said on Wednesday Israeli air strikes on Lebanon could pave the way for the IDF to “enter enemy territory”. Israeli Air Force (IAF) Commander Maj Gen Tomer Bar told troops on Thursday they should be “prepared” to support a “ground manoeuvre” into Lebanon. Meanwhile, Qatar joined calls for a de-escalation with government spokesman Majed al-Ansari saying the country had received ""horrific reports from Lebanon about targeting whole families, in a way that is similar to the atrocities in Gaza"". After meeting with British and Australian counterparts in London, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Israel and Hezbollah face the risk of ""an all-out war"" but that ""a diplomatic solution is still viable"". ""Israel has stated that its goal is to return its citizens to their home in the north. I believe the quickest way to do that is through diplomacy,"" Austin said. On Thursday evening, Israel's defense ministry (IMoD) said it had secured an $8.7bn (£6.5bn) US aid package to support its current military campaigns. In a statement, IMoD said the package includes $3.5bn for ""essential wartime procurement"", which has already been transferred, and $5.2bn for air defense systems such as the Iron Dome, David's Sling and an advanced laser system."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn5xkp3rko,Bowen: West left powerless as Israel claims its biggest victory yet against Hezbollah,Diplomats were hoping to calm matters - they will be looking at events with dismay.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.738635,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"It is time to stop talking about the Middle East being on the brink of a much more serious war. After the devastating Israeli attack on Lebanon – which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah – it feels as if they’re tumbling over it. It was a huge series of blasts, according to people who were in Beirut. A friend of mine in the city said it was the most powerful she had heard in any of Lebanon’s wars.  As rescue workers searched among the rubble, Hezbollah remained silent on the fate of their leader - before confirming his death on Saturday afternoon. It will reinforce Israel's belief that this is their greatest triumph yet against their great enemy. They have mobilised more soldiers, and seem to want to pick up the pace. They may even be thinking about a ground incursion into Lebanon. It is a massively escalatory action. Over the last eleven months there has been an ongoing tit-for-tat between both sides, though with more pressure from the Israelis. But now they have decided they are going to push. They will be delighted with what they have done because – unlike the war against Hamas, which they did not expect – they have been planning this war since 2006. They are now putting those plans into effect. There are now huge challenges for Hezbollah. Their rockets landed again in Israeli territory on Saturday morning, targeting areas further south, so they are pushing back, but this is an uncertain period. That uncertainty is part of the danger. The predictability of the war of attrition that went on for months and months meant people knew where they were - they absolutely do not now. Earlier on Friday there had been hopes, admittedly faint ones, that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was at least prepared to discuss a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. It came from the US and France and was backed by Israel’s most significant Western allies. But in a typically defiant and at times aggressive speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu did not talk about diplomacy. Israel, he said, had no choice but to fight savage enemies who sought its annihilation. Hezbollah would be defeated – and there would be total victory over Hamas in Gaza, which would ensure the return of Israeli hostages. Far from being lambs led to the slaughter – a phrase sometimes used in Israel to refer to the Nazi Holocaust – Israel, he said, was winning. The huge attack in Beirut that occurred as he finished his speech was an even more emphatic sign that a truce in Lebanon was not on Israel’s agenda. It seemed more than feasible that the attack was timed to follow up Mr Netanyahu’s threats that Israel could, and would, hit its enemies, wherever they were. The Pentagon, the US defence department, said it had no advance warning from Israel about the raid. A photo released by the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem showed him at a bank of communications equipment in what looked like his hotel in New York City. The image’s caption said it showed the moment that he authorised the raid. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the policy he has worked on for months. He said there was still room for negotiation. That assertion is looking hollow. The Americans have very few levers to use against any side. They cannot, by law, talk to Hezbollah and Hamas as they are classified as foreign terrorist organisations. With the US elections only weeks away, they are even less likely to put pressure on Israel than they have been in the last year. Powerful voices in the Israeli government and military wanted to attack Hezbollah in the days after the Hamas attacks last October. They argued that they could deal their enemies in Lebanon a decisive blow. The Americans persuaded them not to do it, arguing that the trouble it might set off across the region offset any potential security benefit for Israel. But in the course of the last year Netanyahu has made a habit of defying President Joe Biden’s wishes about the way Israel is fighting. Despite providing Israel with the aircraft and bombs used in the raid on Beirut, President Biden and team were spectators. His policy for the last year, as a lifelong supporter of Israel, was to try to influence Netanyahu by showing solidarity and support, delivering weapons and diplomatic protection. Biden believed that he could persuade Netanyahu not just to change the way Israel fights – the president has said repeatedly that it is imposing too much suffering and killing too many Palestinian civilians – but to accept an American plan for the day after that rested on creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Netanyahu rejected the idea out of hand and has ignored Joe Biden’s advice. After the attack on Beirut, Blinken repeated his view that a combination of deterrence and diplomacy had staved off a wider war in the Middle East. But as events spiral out of US control, he is not sounding convincing. Big decisions lie ahead. First of all, Hezbollah is going to have to decide how to use its remaining arsenal. Do they try to mount a much heavier attack on Israel? If they don’t use their remaining rockets and missiles in storage, they might decide Israel will get around to destroying even more of them. The Israelis also face highly consequential decisions. They have already talked about a ground operation against Lebanon, and while they haven’t yet mobilised all the reserves they might need, their military said on Saturday that they were “ready for a wider escalation”.  Some in Lebanon believe that in a ground war Hezbollah could negate some of Israel’s military strengths. Western diplomats, among them Israel’s staunchest allies, were hoping to calm matters, urging Israel to accept a diplomatic solution. They will now be looking at events with dismay and also a sense of powerlessness."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5zk4gnr40o,Huge air strikes hit Beirut as Israel says it targeted Hezbollah headquarters,US and Israeli media reports said Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was targeted in the strike that destroyed several buildings.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.933292,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has launched a series of huge air strikes in Lebanon’s capital Beirut, targeting what it says is Hezbollah’s central headquarters. At least two people have been killed and 76 injured, according to Lebanese officials, after several buildings were hit in Dahieh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in the south of the city. BBC reporters in Beirut said explosions were followed by chaotic scenes with nearby roads packed with people fleeing. The Israeli military said the headquarters it targeted was located ""under residential buildings"".  Israeli and US media said the strike targeted Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. It was too early to say if Nasrallah was hit, an Israeli official told reporters.  Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told state TV that Israel was crossing Tehran's red lines. ""Assassinations will not solve Israel's problem... With the assassination of resistance leaders, others will take their place,"" he told state TV, Reuters reported. Iran's embassy in Beirut meanwhile said the strike on Dahieh was a ""dangerous game changer"". The attack took place shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “defeat Hezbollah” in a speech at the UN. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said it showed Israel ""does not care"" about US-led efforts to bring about a ceasefire. Israel has sharply escalated its campaign against the Lebanese armed group, with which it has been trading cross-border fire for nearly a year. Air strikes on southern and eastern Lebanon this week have killed nearly 800 people, many of them civilians, Lebanese officials say.  The US had no advance warning of Israel's attack on Dahieh, the Pentagon said. Hezbollah continued firing into Israel on Friday evening, with air raid alerts sounding in multiple areas in the north of the country.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a ""direct hit from a Hezbollah rocket was identified"" on a house and car in the city of Safed. On Thursday allies including the US, UK and EU called for a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon. The 12-strong bloc proposed an immediate 21-day pause in fighting ""to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement"" and a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting the Palestinian armed group Hamas. However in his UN General Assembly speech Netanyahu said Israel would continue attacking Hezbollah to achieve its goal of returning about 70,000 displaced Israelis to their homes in northern Israel. ""As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice. And Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely. And that's exactly what we're doing,"" he told the UN.  Netanyahu's office later said he had cut short his trip to the US and was returning to Israel. In his own speech to the UN on Thursday, Mikati warned that hospitals were no longer capable of treating people because of the sheer number of casualties from Israel’s attacks. ""Israel is violating our sovereignty by sending their war planes and drones to our skies, by killing our civilians, including youth, women and children, destroying homes and forcing families to flee under harsh humanitarian conditions,"" he said. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has since killed more than 41,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on 8 October, saying it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinian group. The group, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries, has launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It has also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. Israel had responded with thousands of its own air, drone and artillery strikes targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon before ramping up its bombardment this week. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ek2gkp9k2o,US urges Israel to stop shooting at UN peacekeepers in Lebanon,Israel has acknowledged that shots fired by its military injured two UN troops in southern Lebanon on Friday.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:27:13.325017,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden has said he is ""absolutely, positively"" urging Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers during its conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, following two incidents in 48 hours.  On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops were responsible for the incident, in which two Sri Lankan soldiers for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) were injured.  IDF soldiers operating around the Unifil base in Naqoura identified a threat and opened fire, the Israeli army said, adding the incident would be investigated ""at the highest levels"".  On Thursday, two Indonesian Unifil soldiers were injured falling from an observation tower after an Israeli tank fired towards it. The leaders of France, Italy and Spain issued a joint statement condemning Israel's actions, saying they were unjustifiable and should immediately come to an end. Sri Lanka's foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemns"" the IDF attack which injured two of its soldiers.  The head of UN peacekeeping said there was reason to believe some firing on UN positions in southern Lebanon had been direct, though he did not ascribe responsibility for the incidents.  ""For example we have a case where a tower was hit by a fire and also damages to cameras at one of the positions - which obviously to us very much looked like direct fire,"" Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the BBC's Newshour programme. As Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon continues, the IDF and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah continued to fire missiles and rockets across the Israel-Lebanon border. The IDF said it had detected about 100 rockets crossing into northern Israel from Lebanon within the space of half an hour on Friday. Two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected crossing from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted, the IDF said. The Lebanese ministry of health said three people, including a two-year-old girl, were killed in an Israeli raid on the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon. Two Lebanese soldiers were killed after Israeli forces targeted an army post in the town of Kafra in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese army said. In the capital, Beirut, emergency workers continued to comb through the wreckage of buildings hit by two Israeli air strikes on Thursday.  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the attacks came with no warning and killed 22 people, all civilians, and injured another 117. Israel has not commented. Israeli forces launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon last month as they escalated their response to rocket fire from Hezbollah. Hezbollah and Israel have been trading near-daily cross-border fire since last October, when the Palestinian armed group Hamas in the Gaza Strip carried out a deadly attack in southern Israel.  The IDF has said the UN post struck in Naqoura on Friday was about 164ft (50m) away from the source of the threat identified by soldiers. It said it had told peacekeeping troops to stay in protected spaces at the time. Unifil said Israeli military vehicles had knocked over barriers at another UN site in Labbouneh, closer to the border with Israel. The incidents represented a ""serious development"", it said. Mikati said Friday’s attack was ""a crime which is directed at the international community"". Israel argues that Unifil has failed to stabilise the region, and has asked peacekeepers to withdraw northwards so it can confront Hezbollah.  The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, has reiterated Israel's call for Unifil personnel to withdraw north by 5km (3 miles) to ""avoid danger,"" but the UN's  Jean-Pierre Lacroix said they would remain in position. About 10,000 peacekeepers from 50 countries are stationed in Lebanon, alongside around 800 civilian staff. Since 1978, they have patrolled the area between the Litani River and the UN-recognised boundary between Lebanon and Israel, known as the ""Blue Line"". Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel. The Iran-backed group says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians and has said it will stop firing if there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Over the past three weeks, Israel has dramatically escalated its campaign against Hezbollah, intensifying air strikes against southern Lebanon and southern parts of Beirut, assassinating Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and launching a ground invasion. Lebanon says more than 2,000 people have been killed, mainly in the recent escalation, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. This week Hezbollah rocket fire has killed two Israeli civilians and a Thai national, Israeli authorities say. In a separate development on Friday, Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying at least 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes in the Jabalia town and refugee camp in the north of the Palestinian enclave. The IDF has not commented on the issue. Meanwhile, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said ""thousands are trapped"" in the Jabalia refugee camp, including five of its staff. The MSF said Israeli forces had issued evacuation orders on 7 October in Jabalia, ""while carrying out attacks at the same time"", meaning people could not leave safely. Dr Mohammed Salha, the acting director of the al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia, told the BBC's Newshour programme the area had been under siege for seven days. He warned that the hospital would run out of fuel on Saturday, as Israeli forces were ""cutting Jabalia from the rest of Gaza"". ""No medication, no medical supplies, no healthy water, no fuel, so pressure, pressure on these people to move and go directly to the south,"" Dr Salha said. Israel has been conducting a new ground operation in the area, saying it is targeting regrouping Hamas fighters who aim to launch attacks, with dozens of people reportedly killed or wounded in northern Gaza in recent days."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20d0r8rvro,Israeli strike hits key road used to flee Lebanon,Israel's military says the crossing point with Syria was being used by Hezbollah to smuggle in weapons.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:23.663601,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Israeli air strike has hit near the main border crossing point for people fleeing the escalating bombing and ground campaign in Lebanon for neighbouring Syria. Israel's military said it had hit Hezbollah targets near the Masnaa crossing, and earlier claimed the group was using it to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.  The strike on Friday destroyed a section of the road and effectively cut off vehicle access. People are still able to make the journey on foot, with pictures showing families clambering over rubble and scrambling through the four-metre crater in the road to get out of the country. More than 300,000 people have left Lebanon for Syria in the past 10 days to flee the bombing, according to Lebanese government figures.  The strike on Friday hit the road 700m from the checkpoint on the Lebanese side, and around 5km (3.1 miles) from the border itself.  Aid workers said the destruction of the road near Masnaa crossing hinders both the movement of people and also food and humanitarian supplies.  ""It will mean that goods which would normally come overland through that crossing - the cheapest, most effective way to bring commodities into that country -  will also not be able to be received here,"" Matthew Hollingworth, the director of the UN's World Food programme, told the BBC. Mr Hollingworth stressed that it was essential for other routes leading out of Lebanon - particularly those in the north - to remain unhindered. ""We really would press that they remain open because they will be critical for people to leave, and also for humanitarian commodities to come in,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Masnaa crossing in Lebanon's east had been the main path for people to move into Syria, and then onto Jordan and the Gulf States, while in Lebanon the road had also connected west to the capital Beirut on the coast, which has been heavily bombed in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Friday said it had targeted a site at the border crossing where ""weapons were transferred to Hezbollah"", and also a 3.5km underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria, the location of which was not specified. In a statement issued before the strike, the IDF said the crossing had become the ""primary border crossing for Hezbollah's weapons transfers"" and accused the group of concealing ""smuggling activity among civilian trucks and vehicles"". It called on Lebanon to thoroughly inspect trucks.  Many people moving east are Syrian nationals living in Lebanon, who have headed back to their own country to escape Israel's bombardments. The BBC spoke to one woman in Beirut, who had sent her son back to Syria this week because the capital was too dangerous. ""I found a lot of people from our neighbourhood heading for Syria, so I sent him with them,"" she said. Syria's government said on Sunday that for the next week people crossing the border would no longer have to pay $100 to enter the country. On Friday, strikes also hit near Lebanon's only commercial airport, the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. The airport borders the suburb of Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the city, and a continued target of Israeli air strikes. Major strikes there one week ago killed the long-time leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicated that the new strikes on Friday morning were aimed at the group's new leadership, including a potential new overall leader, Hashem Safieddine. Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks on Thursday while 151 others had been wounded. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli air strikes since fighting began in October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry says.  Israeli forces on Friday also told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the South, including the regional capital city of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their safety. The new order applies to communities further inland, north of the Litani river, about 30km from the border with Israel.  The river is a crucial marker as Israel has previously demanded that Hezbollah withdraw to the Litani, as per the UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006. But there are concerns in Lebanon that Israel will seek to occupy part of the country's south again."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20jx85vxwdo,Israel striking Hezbollah with ‘full force’ despite ceasefire calls,"More than 600 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon since Monday, health officials say.",27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:29.041833,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the country’s military to continue fighting with “full force” against the armed group Hezbollah, despite calls from the US and other allies for a ceasefire. Lebanon's health ministry said at least 92 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, with hundreds more killed since the strikes escalated on Monday. Hezbollah has confirmed that an air strike on an apartment building in the south of Beirut killed the head of its drone unit, Mohammad Surur. Fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah are at a high, after a dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since Monday. The increase in hostilities prompted a 12-strong bloc - including the US, UK and EU - to propose a three week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah on Wednesday. The proposal was initially met with hope after Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said his country was “open to ideas”. But by Thursday it had been roundly rejected by Israeli politicians. Landing in New York for the UN General Assembly, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would “not stop” in Lebanon until it reached all of its goals, “chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.” The White House later said the ceasefire proposal had been “coordinated” with Israel, despite Mr Netanyahu's assertion, just hours later, that his country would continue fighting. Early on Friday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement seeking to ""clarify a few points"" due to ""a lot of misreporting around the US-led ceasefire initiative"". ""Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,"" the statement said. ""Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes,"" it said, adding it ""appreciates the US efforts in this regard"".  Discussions will continue in the days ahead, the statement finished.  Speaking in New York, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called for an ""immediate ceasefire to provide space for a diplomatic settlement"" to resolve the conflict in Lebanon. He said the conflict could spill over into a war ""no one can control"". Around 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from the north of the country since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza, began nearly a year ago. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. Through Thursday, the Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s south and in the Bekaa Valley in the country’s east. It also struck infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border, which it said was to cut weapons supplies to the group. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had fired 50 rockets towards the city of Kiryat Ata, and 80 missiles towards the city of Safed, both in northern Israel. The Israeli army said it intercepted a missile that was fired from Yemen after sirens and explosions were heard. Israel’s military chief Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said on Wednesday Israeli air strikes on Lebanon could pave the way for the IDF to “enter enemy territory”. Israeli Air Force (IAF) Commander Maj Gen Tomer Bar told troops on Thursday they should be “prepared” to support a “ground manoeuvre” into Lebanon. Meanwhile, Qatar joined calls for a de-escalation with government spokesman Majed al-Ansari saying the country had received ""horrific reports from Lebanon about targeting whole families, in a way that is similar to the atrocities in Gaza"". After meeting with British and Australian counterparts in London, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Israel and Hezbollah face the risk of ""an all-out war"" but that ""a diplomatic solution is still viable"". ""Israel has stated that its goal is to return its citizens to their home in the north. I believe the quickest way to do that is through diplomacy,"" Austin said. On Thursday evening, Israel's defense ministry (IMoD) said it had secured an $8.7bn (£6.5bn) US aid package to support its current military campaigns. In a statement, IMoD said the package includes $3.5bn for ""essential wartime procurement"", which has already been transferred, and $5.2bn for air defense systems such as the Iron Dome, David's Sling and an advanced laser system."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pg1qpxxzo,"Bowen: Israel is gambling Hezbollah will crumple but it faces a well-armed, angry enemy",The Lebanese armed group has - like Israel - spent years preparing and is more formidable than Hamas in Gaza.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:29.132541,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel’s leaders are jubilant about the progress of the offensive against Hezbollah that started with the detonation of weaponised pagers and radios and moved on to intense and deadly airstrikes.  Defence Minister Yoav Gallant did not hold back his praise after Monday’s air strikes.  “Today was a masterpiece… This was the worst week Hezbollah has had since its establishment, and the results speak for themselves.” Gallant said airstrikes destroyed thousands of rockets that could have killed Israeli citizens. In the process Lebanon says Israel killed more than 550 of its citizens, including 50 children.  That is almost half Lebanon’s dead in a month of war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Israel believes that a ferocious offensive will coerce Hezbollah into doing what it wants, inflicting so much pain that its leader Hassan Nasrallah and his allies and backers in Iran decide that the price of resistance is too high. Israel’s politicians and generals need a victory. After almost a year of war Gaza has become a quagmire. Hamas fighters still emerge out of tunnels and ruins to kill and wound Israeli soldiers and are still holding Israeli hostages. Hamas caught Israel by surprise last October. The Israelis did not see Hamas as a significant threat, with devastating consequences. Lebanon is different. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Mossad spy agency have been planning the next war against Hezbollah since the last war ended in a stalemate in 2006. Israel’s leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, believes the current offensive is making big progress towards his declared objective of tipping the balance of power away from Hezbollah. He wants to stop Hezbollah firing rockets over the border into Israel. At the same time, the Israeli military says the plan is to force Hezbollah back from the border and to destroy military facilities that threaten Israel. The last week in Lebanon brings back echoes of the last year of war in Gaza. Israel issued warnings to civilians, as it did in Gaza, to move out of areas about to be attacked. It blames Hezbollah, as it blames Hamas, for using civilians as human shields. Some critics as well as enemies of Israel said the warnings were too vague and did not give enough time for families to evacuate. The laws of war demand that civilians be protected, and forbid indiscriminate, disproportionate use of force. Some of Hezbollah's attacks on Israel have hit civilian areas, breaking laws designed to protect civilians. They have also targeted the Israeli military. Israel and key Western allies, including the US and UK, classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. Israel insists it has a moral army that respects the rules. But much of the world has condemned its conduct in Gaza. The ignition of a wider border war will deepen the gap at the centre of a highly polarised argument.  Take the pager attack. Israel says it was aimed at Hezbollah operatives who had been issued with the pagers. But Israel could not know where they would be when the bombs inside the pagers were triggered, which was why civilians and children in homes, shops and other public places were wounded and killed. That, some leading lawyers say, proves that Israel was using deadly force without distinguishing between combatants and civilians; a violation of the rules of war. The fight between Israel and Hezbollah started in the 1980s. But this border war began the day after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, when Hassan Nasrallah ordered his men to begin a limited, but almost daily barrage over the border to support Hamas. It tied up Israeli troops and forced around 60,000 people in border towns to leave their homes. A few voices in the Israeli media have compared the impact of the air strikes on Hezbollah's capacity to wage war to Operation Focus, Israel’s surprise attack on Egypt in June 1967. It was a famous raid that destroyed the Egyptian air force when its aircraft were lined up on the ground. Over the next six days Israel defeated Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The victory created the shape of the current conflict as Israel captured the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It is not a good comparison. Lebanon, and war with Hezbollah, is different. Israel has inflicted heavy blows. But so far it has not stopped Hezbollah's capacity or will to fire into Israel. Israel’s earlier wars with Hezbollah were grinding, attritional and never produced a decisive victory for either side. This one might go the same way, however satisfying the last week of offensive action has been for Israel, its intelligence services and its military. Israel’s offensive rests on an assumption - a gamble - that a point will come when Hezbollah will crumple, retreat from the border and stop firing into Israel. Most observers of Hezbollah believe it will not stop. Fighting Israel is the main reason why Hezbollah exists. That means Israel, just as reluctant to admit defeat, would have to escalate the war further. If Hezbollah continued to make northern Israel too dangerous for Israeli civilians to return home, Israel would have to decide whether to launch a ground offensive, probably to capture a strip of land to act as a buffer zone. Israel has invaded Lebanon before. In 1982 its forces swept up to Beirut to try to stop Palestinian raids into Israel. They were forced into an ignominious retreat in the face of fury at home and abroad, after Israeli troops held the perimeter as their Lebanese Christian allies massacred Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut. By the 1990s Israel still occupied a broad band of Lebanese land along the border. Today’s Israeli generals were then young officers, who fought in endless skirmishes and firefights against Hezbollah, which was growing stronger as it fought to drive Israel out. Ehud Barak, then Israel’s prime minister and a former chief of staff of the IDF, withdrew from the so-called ""security zone"" in 2000. He decided that it did not make Israel any safer and was costing Israel the lives of too many soldiers. In 2006 an ill-judged raid by Hezbollah across the tense and highly militarised border killed and captured Israeli soldiers. After the war ended Hassan Nasrallah said he would not have allowed the raid had he realised what Israel would do in return. Ehud Olmert, by then Israel’s prime minister, went to war.  At first Israel hoped air power would stop rocket attacks into Israel. When it did not, ground troops and tanks once again rolled back over the border. The war was a disaster for Lebanese civilians. But on the last day of the war, Hezbollah was still launching salvoes of rockets into Israel. Israel’s commanders know that entering Lebanon under fire would be much more formidable military challenge than fighting Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah has also been making plans since the end of the 2006 war, and would be fighting on home ground, in south Lebanon which has plenty of rugged, hilly terrain that suits guerrilla tactics. Israel has not been able to destroy all the tunnels Hamas dug through sand in Gaza. In the borderlands of south Lebanon, Hezbollah has spent the last 18 years preparing tunnels and positions in solid rock. It has a formidable arsenal, supplied by Iran. Unlike Hamas in Gaza, it can be resupplied by land through Syria. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington DC, estimates that Hezbollah has around 30,000 active fighters and up to 20,000 reserves, mostly trained as mobile small units of light infantry. Many of its men have combat experience fighting in support of the Assad regime in Syria.  Most estimates say that Hezbollah has something between 120,000 and 200,000 missiles and rockets, ranging from unguided weapons to longer-range weapons that could hit Israel’s cities. Israel may be gambling that Hezbollah will not use all of them, fearful that the Israeli air force will do to Lebanon what it did to Gaza, turning entire towns to rubble and killing thousands of civilians. Iran might not want Hezbollah to use weapons it would like to reserve as insurance against an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. That’s another gamble. Hezbollah might decide to use more of its arsenal before Israel destroys it. With the war continuing in Gaza, and rising levels of violence on the occupied West Bank, Israel would also have to contemplate a third front if it invaded Lebanon. Its soldiers are motivated, well trained and equipped, but the reserve units that provide much of Israel’s fighting power are already feeling the strain after a year of war. Israel’s allies, led by the United States, did not want Israel to escalate the war with Hezbollah and do not want it to invade Lebanon. They insist that only diplomacy can make the border safe enough for civilians to return to their homes on either side of it. An American envoy has worked out an agreement, partly based on UN Security resolution 1701 that ended the 2006 war. But diplomats have their hands tied without a ceasefire in Gaza. Hasan Nasrallah has said Hezbollah will stop attacking Israel only when the Gaza war stops. At the moment neither Hamas nor the Israelis are prepared to make the necessary concessions that would produce a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and a swap of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. As Israeli air strikes continue to pound Lebanon, civilians who were already struggling to provide for their families in a broken economy face terrible pain and uncertainty. Fear crosses front lines. Israelis know that Hezbollah could do them much worse damage than they have in the last year. Israel believes the time has come to be aggressive and audacious, to blast Hezbollah away from its borders. But it faces an obdurate, well-armed and angry enemy. This is the most dangerous crisis in the long year of war since Hamas attacked Israel and at the moment nothing is stopping it spiralling towards something much worse.

John Mason had the whip removed in August after posting on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. He later told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland that the situation was ""nothing like"" previous examples of genocide. Mason was expelled following a meeting of the  SNP Member Conduct Committee on Saturday and has 21 days to appeal the decision. Mason confirmed his expulsion on social media. Writing on X he said: ""Very disappointed to be expelled from @theSNP over my comments on Israel, Gaza, and whether or not there has been genocide.  ""I continue to believe that we should be able to tolerate a variety of views within the Party as long as we are all committed to Scottish independence."" Mason was suspended days after External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson was pictured standing alongside Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky Many SNP figures are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East and the diplomatic encounter prompted an internal backlash. But Scotland's First Minister John Swinney defended the face-to-face meeting with an Israeli government representative. The SNP said it could not comment on his expulsion until after the end of the period for an appeal. At the time of the Glasgow Shettleston MSP's suspension a spokesperson for the SNP chief whip said: ""To flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable. ""There can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance."" The war began after Hamas’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

At least two people have been killed and 76 injured, according to Lebanese officials, after several buildings were hit in Dahieh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in the south of the city. BBC reporters in Beirut said explosions were followed by chaotic scenes with nearby roads packed with people fleeing. The Israeli military said the headquarters it targeted was located ""under residential buildings"".  Israeli and US media said the strike targeted Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. It was too early to say if Nasrallah was hit, an Israeli official told reporters.  Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told state TV that Israel was crossing Tehran's red lines. ""Assassinations will not solve Israel's problem... With the assassination of resistance leaders, others will take their place,"" he told state TV, Reuters reported. Iran's embassy in Beirut meanwhile said the strike on Dahieh was a ""dangerous game changer"". The attack took place shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “defeat Hezbollah” in a speech at the UN. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said it showed Israel ""does not care"" about US-led efforts to bring about a ceasefire. Israel has sharply escalated its campaign against the Lebanese armed group, with which it has been trading cross-border fire for nearly a year. Air strikes on southern and eastern Lebanon this week have killed nearly 800 people, many of them civilians, Lebanese officials say.  The US had no advance warning of Israel's attack on Dahieh, the Pentagon said. Hezbollah continued firing into Israel on Friday evening, with air raid alerts sounding in multiple areas in the north of the country.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a ""direct hit from a Hezbollah rocket was identified"" on a house and car in the city of Safed. On Thursday allies including the US, UK and EU called for a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon. The 12-strong bloc proposed an immediate 21-day pause in fighting ""to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement"" and a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting the Palestinian armed group Hamas. However in his UN General Assembly speech Netanyahu said Israel would continue attacking Hezbollah to achieve its goal of returning about 70,000 displaced Israelis to their homes in northern Israel. ""As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice. And Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely. And that's exactly what we're doing,"" he told the UN.  Netanyahu's office later said he had cut short his trip to the US and was returning to Israel. In his own speech to the UN on Thursday, Mikati warned that hospitals were no longer capable of treating people because of the sheer number of casualties from Israel’s attacks. ""Israel is violating our sovereignty by sending their war planes and drones to our skies, by killing our civilians, including youth, women and children, destroying homes and forcing families to flee under harsh humanitarian conditions,"" he said. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has since killed more than 41,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on 8 October, saying it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinian group. The group, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries, has launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It has also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. Israel had responded with thousands of its own air, drone and artillery strikes targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon before ramping up its bombardment this week. "

Her sister Rahma is fair-haired and has blue eyes. There is a 13-year age difference between them. But to Malak - who lost her father in an Israeli attack - the four-month-old baby is an unimaginably precious gift. “I love her so much, in a way no-one else knows,” she says. The BBC went back to meet Malak and others in Gaza as the first anniversary of the war approached. We first interviewed Malak in February, just after the death of her father, Abed-Alrahman al-Najjar, a 32-year-old farm labourer. The father of seven, believed to have been hit by shrapnel, was among more than 70 people killed during an Israeli commando operation to rescue two hostages held by Hamas in Rafah. He was asleep with his family in a refugee tent when the raid happened. Their tent was close to the scene of the fighting. Malak lost an eye in the attack. She also suffered a wound in her side. Back then she was severely traumatised - when she met a BBC colleague, she called out in anguish, “I am in pain. I lost my dad. Enough!” Since then, doctors have fitted a small white sphere in her empty eye socket. It will have to suffice until the war ends and she hopefully can be fitted with a proper prosthetic eye. But Malak does not complain about this loss - rather, she imagines how her father would react if he could hold baby Rahma, born three months after his death. She smiles and says: “He always wanted to have a daughter with blue eyes.” After what has happened, Malak wants to train as an eye doctor, to help others who suffer as she does. She is sitting on a concrete floor in Khan Younis in southern Gaza with the baby and her five other younger siblings - three sisters, two brothers, aged between four and 12 years old. Before the war, their father worked hard on other people’s farms to support his family. “Our father used to take us out and buy us clothes in the winter. He was so kind to us. He would deny himself but never us,” Malak remembers. Then came 7 October 2023, and the Hamas assault on Israel in which over 1,200 Israelis were killed - among them, dozens of children. More than 250 hostages were abducted into Gaza. There were 30 children seized, including a baby of nine months.  The attack triggered Israel’s ground invasion, relentless air strikes and fighting with Hamas. Almost 42,000 people have now been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. About 90% of Gaza’s population - nearly two million people - are displaced, according to the United Nations. Malak’s family has been uprooted four times. “I carry a pain that even mountains cannot bear,” she says. “We were displaced, and it feels like our whole life is displacement. We move from place to place.” The Israeli government refuses to allow foreign reporters into Gaza, and the BBC relies on a team of local journalists to cover the humanitarian crisis. We briefed them with questions and asked them to contact some of the Palestinians we have spoken to in Gaza over the past 12 months. These journalists share the fear and displacement of the people they report on. Displacement means uncertainty. Constant fear. Will the child, sent for a bucket of water, come home? Or will they return to find their home flattened, and their family buried under the rubble? These are the questions that haunt Abed-Alrahman’s young widow, Nawara, every day. “There is always shelling and we are always afraid, terrified. I constantly hold my children close and hug them,” she says. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tell people to move to so-called “humanitarian zones”. People flee but often find no safety. When they move, the struggle to locate food, firewood and medicine in an unfamiliar place starts again. The al-Najjars are now back in their family home, but they know they may have to flee again. That is the inescapable reality of their lives after a year of war. In the words of Nawara, there is “no safe place in the Gaza Strip”. Nawara complains of the overflowing sewage in the street. The lack of medical supplies. Like so many in Gaza, with no income, she depends on what food her in-laws or charities can supply.  There are no schools open for her children, who are among the 465,000 that Unicef - the UN Children’s Fund - estimate are affected by school closures there. “Our health - my children’s and mine - is bad. They are always sick, always have fevers or diarrhoea. They are always feeling unwell,” Nawara adds. Through all of this, she holds on to the memory of her husband Abed-Alrahman. “I look at his picture, and keep talking to him. I imagine he’s still alive,” she says. “I keep talking to him on the phone as if he’s replying to me, and I imagine answering back. Every day I sit by myself, bring up his name, talk to him, and cry. I feel like he’s aware of everything I’m going through.” And Malak too has her daily ritual. She and one of her sisters try to do a charitable deed each day in memory of their father. When possible, their aunt makes a gift of food for the dead man. “At night, we put it out and pray for him,” Malak says. The stories of Nawara al-Najjar and Malak are a fragmentary glimpse into the suffering of the last 12 months. As the war enters its second year, our BBC colleagues on the ground continue to report on death and displacement. In northern Gaza we re-visited the family of a disabled man who died after being attacked in an Israeli search operation. ___ Muhammed Bhar was terrified. The dog growled and lunged. It was biting, drawing blood and he could not stop it. Around him, the sitting room was full of noise - his mother and little niece screaming, the Israeli soldiers shouting orders. Muhammed, aged 24, had Down's syndrome and was autistic - he could not have understood what was happening. When a BBC colleague first spoke to his family in July, they were still struggling with the shock of what had happened. Muhammed’s mother, Nabila, 70, described what she remembered: “I constantly see the dog tearing at him and his hand, and the blood pouring from his hand. “This scene I will never forget - it stays in front of my eyes the whole time, it never leaves me at all. We couldn't save him, neither from them, nor from the dog.” The incident happened on 3 July, as troops were engaged in intense close-quarter combat in Shejaiya. The IDF said that there were “significant exchanges of fire between [its troops] and Hamas terrorists”. According to the IDF, troops were searching buildings for Hamas using a dog - these animals are regularly used to hunt for fighters, booby traps, explosives and weapons. “Inside one of the buildings,” the IDF said, “the canine detected terrorists and bit an individual.” The soldiers restrained the animal and gave Muhammed some “initial medical treatment” in another room. Nabila Bhar said a military doctor arrived and went into the room where Muhammed was lying. His niece, Janna Bhar, 11, remembered troops saying he was “fine”. Two of Muhammed’s brothers were arrested during the raid, according to the family. They say one has since been released. Nabila said the rest of the family was ordered to leave. They pleaded to be allowed to stay with the wounded Muhammed. The IDF said they were “urged to leave to avoid staying in the combat area”. Some time after this - the army has not said how long - the troops left. The IDF said they went to help soldiers who had been ambushed. The army report for 3 July named Capt Roy Miller, 21, as having been killed, and three other soldiers wounded, during fighting in Shejaiya. Muhammed was now alone. The IDF statement did not say what condition he was in when the soldiers left. His brother Jibreel believes he had not been given proper treatment. “They could have treated him much better than they did, but they just put some gauze on him, as if they did a quick, careless job. Whether he lived or died didn’t seem to matter to them,” he says. The Israelis withdrew from the neighbourhood a week later and Muhammed’s family returned. They found him dead on the kitchen floor. It is still not known what exactly caused his death after he was attacked by the dog. In the current wartime circumstances the family has not been able to have an autopsy carried out. The young man was buried in an alleyway beside the house because it was too dangerous to go to the cemetery where his father - who died before the war - was interred. Three months later, Muhammed is still interred in the alleyway. His brother Jibreel has covered the grave with plastic sheeting, some concrete blocks and a sheet of corrugated iron. It is surrounded by a mess of rubble and pieces of metal, the detritus from bombed-out buildings nearby. Inside, Muhammed’s bedroom has been left shuttered. Jibreel opens the door, walks into the darkness, opens a wardrobe and takes out some of his brother’s clothes. Along with some photographs and family videos, they are the remaining mementoes of his life in the house. “His personal room was where he exercised, played, and ate, and no-one entered this room except for him,” he says. In the sitting room, Jibreel points to the couch where Muhammed was sitting when the dog attacked. The blood stains have dried into the fabric. “Every corner of this house reminds us of Muhammad,” Jibreel says. “This is the spot where he would always sit. We would sit around him, making sure not to disturb him. He loved peace and quiet.” The family wants an independent investigation into his death. “Once the war ends and international human rights organisations and legal groups return,” says Jibreel, “we will definitely file a legal case against the Israeli army. “Muhammad was a special case - he wasn’t a fighter, he wasn’t armed, just an ordinary civilian. He wasn’t even just any civilian, he had special needs.” ___ Most of Dr Amjad Elawa’s neighbours and friends have gone. They are either dead or have fled south, hoping it will be safer there. When he walks home from the hospital, he sees people on the streets talking to themselves. “No one is in their right mind anymore,” he says. Dr Elawa, 32, works in the Emergency Services department of al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza. Back at the start of the war it was the largest medical complex in the Gaza Strip. Now, much of the hospital is in ruins following two major raids by the IDF, who said Hamas and other gunmen used the facility to plan and launch attacks in breach of international law. The charge is rejected by Gaza's health ministry, which accuses Israel of committing war crimes at al-Shifa. Dr Elawa has seen children die in front of him. Victims of war wounds. Of disease, often caused by the lack of clean water. And when the BBC first met him, the area was facing acute malnutrition. In February - when the BBC first interviewed Dr Elawa - he described witnessing the death of two-month-old Mahmoud Fatou. The baby boy died soon after being brought to the hospital. ""This child could not be provided with milk. His mum was not provided with food to be able to breastfeed him,"" said Dr Elawa. ""He had symptoms of severe dehydration, and he was taking his last breaths when he came."" Dr Elawa’s own son was born 12 days after the 7 October attacks. After the death of Mahmoud Fatou, he reflected on his own family situation. “We were all shocked - this child could be our child. Maybe my son after a few days will be just like him,” he said. Thankfully, Dr Elawa’s son is healthy and about to celebrate his first birthday. The doctor faces the same problems as almost everybody else in northern Gaza. His house was destroyed and he had to move with his family to a patient’s home. The UN and humanitarian NGOs in Gaza say Israel has regularly blocked aid from entering. For example, in the first two weeks of January (the month before we met Dr Elawa), the UN said 69% of requests to move aid and 95% of missions to provide fuel and medicines to water reservoirs, water wells and health facilities in northern Gaza, were refused. Israel denies blocking aid. Dr Elawa queued for food whenever he could get any free time. This led to him being wounded when Israeli forces opened fire at Nabulsi roundabout in northern Gaza on 29 February. Thousands of people had gathered, hoping to be given flour from an aid convoy escorted by the IDF. More than 100 people were killed and over 700 wounded according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The IDF said most of the casualties were caused by a stampede as people rushed the trucks. The army said there were two incidents at the roundabout. It fired warning shots and then shot at individuals who the troops believed were a threat. Numerous survivors challenge that account, and say the stampede was caused by the army firing into the crowd. Dr Elawa treated his own wound and then went to help survivors. Within days he was back on duty at al-Shifa. A BBC colleague returned recently to find Dr Elawa still working in the emergency section. He returns to the theme of the wounded children he treats. “They are the only ones who really stir our emotions, especially when their limbs are lost. It’s a truly emotional and heartbreaking situation. We see children who haven’t experienced much of life yet, losing their legs.” On a break, he goes outside and points to the ruins of different buildings. “It used to have an intensive care unit, an operating room, and a cardiology department,” he says. “Whether it’s medical devices, equipment, or anything else, all are completely destroyed, even the beds. We need a fully equipped hospital, built from scratch.” When Dr Elawa returned after the second Israeli raid there was an overpowering stench of death from several mass graves. One of the hospital directors, Mohamed Mughir, says there were “signs of field executions, binding marks, gunshot wounds to the head and torture marks on the limbs” of some of the corpses. The IDF deny allegations of war crimes and say the graves contain bodies exhumed and then re-buried by the army when searching for dead Israeli hostages. ""The claim that the IDF buried Palestinian bodies is baseless and unfounded,"" it says. The UN Human Rights Director, Volker Turk, says that, given what he calls “the prevailing climate of impunity”, there should be an independent international investigation. There is more food now. Dr Elawa has a supply of flour but says there are no vegetables, fruit or meat. They use canned foods instead. Like so many who work to save lives in Gaza, Dr Elawa prays for the war to end. “We want to return to our old lives, to be able to sleep safely, to walk in the streets safely, to visit our loved ones and relatives - those who are still alive.” Additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen, Alice Doyard and Nik Millard."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20d0r8rvro,Israeli strike hits key road used to flee Lebanon,Israel's military says the crossing point with Syria was being used by Hezbollah to smuggle in weapons.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:29.501345,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Israeli air strike has hit near the main border crossing point for people fleeing the escalating bombing and ground campaign in Lebanon for neighbouring Syria. Israel's military said it had hit Hezbollah targets near the Masnaa crossing, and earlier claimed the group was using it to smuggle weapons into Lebanon.  The strike on Friday destroyed a section of the road and effectively cut off vehicle access. People are still able to make the journey on foot, with pictures showing families clambering over rubble and scrambling through the four-metre crater in the road to get out of the country. More than 300,000 people have left Lebanon for Syria in the past 10 days to flee the bombing, according to Lebanese government figures.  The strike on Friday hit the road 700m from the checkpoint on the Lebanese side, and around 5km (3.1 miles) from the border itself.  Aid workers said the destruction of the road near Masnaa crossing hinders both the movement of people and also food and humanitarian supplies.  ""It will mean that goods which would normally come overland through that crossing - the cheapest, most effective way to bring commodities into that country -  will also not be able to be received here,"" Matthew Hollingworth, the director of the UN's World Food programme, told the BBC. Mr Hollingworth stressed that it was essential for other routes leading out of Lebanon - particularly those in the north - to remain unhindered. ""We really would press that they remain open because they will be critical for people to leave, and also for humanitarian commodities to come in,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Masnaa crossing in Lebanon's east had been the main path for people to move into Syria, and then onto Jordan and the Gulf States, while in Lebanon the road had also connected west to the capital Beirut on the coast, which has been heavily bombed in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Friday said it had targeted a site at the border crossing where ""weapons were transferred to Hezbollah"", and also a 3.5km underground tunnel between Lebanon and Syria, the location of which was not specified. In a statement issued before the strike, the IDF said the crossing had become the ""primary border crossing for Hezbollah's weapons transfers"" and accused the group of concealing ""smuggling activity among civilian trucks and vehicles"". It called on Lebanon to thoroughly inspect trucks.  Many people moving east are Syrian nationals living in Lebanon, who have headed back to their own country to escape Israel's bombardments. The BBC spoke to one woman in Beirut, who had sent her son back to Syria this week because the capital was too dangerous. ""I found a lot of people from our neighbourhood heading for Syria, so I sent him with them,"" she said. Syria's government said on Sunday that for the next week people crossing the border would no longer have to pay $100 to enter the country. On Friday, strikes also hit near Lebanon's only commercial airport, the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. The airport borders the suburb of Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the city, and a continued target of Israeli air strikes. Major strikes there one week ago killed the long-time leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Reports indicated that the new strikes on Friday morning were aimed at the group's new leadership, including a potential new overall leader, Hashem Safieddine. Lebanon's public health ministry said 37 people had been killed in ground and air attacks on Thursday while 151 others had been wounded. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli air strikes since fighting began in October 2023, the Lebanese health ministry says.  Israeli forces on Friday also told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the South, including the regional capital city of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their safety. The new order applies to communities further inland, north of the Litani river, about 30km from the border with Israel.  The river is a crucial marker as Israel has previously demanded that Hezbollah withdraw to the Litani, as per the UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006. But there are concerns in Lebanon that Israel will seek to occupy part of the country's south again."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dy294gweyo,Hezbollah drone attack kills four Israeli soldiers and injures 58,"Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon.",8 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:27:29.593359,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Four soldiers have been killed and 58 injured in a drone strike targeting an army base in northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said. The IDF added seven soldiers had been severely injured in the attack on a base ""adjacent to Binyamina"" - a town around 20 miles (33km) to the south of Haifa. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted a training camp of the IDF's Golani Brigade in the area, which is based between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The armed group's media office said the strike was in response to Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon and Beirut on Thursday. The group said it targeted the camp in northern Israel using a ""swarm of drones"".  The attack was one of the biggest on an Israeli position in more than a year. The Israeli ambulance service, Magen David Adom (MDA), earlier said 61 people had been injured in the attack - including three critically. It added 37 of them had been taken to eight regional hospitals, either by ambulance or helicopter. In a statement before the IDF confirmed the deaths, MDA said that alongside the three critically injured, 18 of the victims were in a moderate condition, 31 sustained mild injuries and nine people were ""suffering anxiety"". The reason for the discrepancy in the number of critical injuries between MDA and the IDF is not clear. Israeli censorship rules had initially prevented media outlets reporting exactly where or what was targeted, before the IDF confirmed it was the Binyamina base. Some Israeli media outlets have reported the base was hit by a low-level drone launched from Lebanon - a relatively unsophisticated weapon that appears not to have activated early-warning alarms. Throughout the evening, television bulletins, social media posts and online reports showed footage of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, taking casualties to hospitals across northern Israel. Many of the wounded have been evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Medical Centre in nearby Hadera - with others being taken to hospitals in Tel Hashomer, Haifa, Afula and Netanya. Details are still scarce but many of the injured appear to have been in a communal canteen at the time and were caught completely by surprise. Images circulating on social media appear to show an empty mess hall with a hole in the roof. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xe8nkj9wyo,Lebanon strikes are preparing for ground offensive - Israel army chief,"More than 50 people were killed by Israeli strikes on Wednesday, as Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:29.689789,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel’s military chief has told troops that extensive air strikes in Lebanon targeting the armed group Hezbollah could pave the way for them to “enter enemy territory”. ""You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah,"" Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said. Lebanon’s health minister said more than 50 people were killed in strikes on Wednesday, which the Israeli military said hit Hezbollah’s intelligence directorate, as well as launchers and weapons stores. Diplomatic efforts are gathering pace to de-escalate the hostilities, with France and the United States proposing a 21-day ceasefire. The remarks by Lt Gen Halevi are the plainest indication yet from a senior figure that a ground invasion into Lebanon may be imminent. “We keep striking and hitting them everywhere,” he told soldiers from the 7th Brigade taking part in an exercise on Israel’s northern border on Wednesday - in a statement quoted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  “The goal is very clear - to safely return the residents of the north. To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a manoeuvre, which means your military boots... will enter enemy territory.” Lt Gen Halevi said troops would ""destroy the enemy"" and its infrastructure. There was no immediate sign that Israel was poised to enter Lebanon and the US Pentagon said on Wednesday it did not appear ""imminent"".  But the IDF chief of staff’s remarks were published shortly after the IDF called up two reserve brigades for ""operational missions in the northern arena”. When a BBC team visited an Israeli border town on Wednesday, the army said that Hezbollah fighters must move well back from the border, to positions north of the Litani River, as demanded by a UN resolution passed in 2006. Israel's allies, including the US, have said they are working to avoid all-out war in the region.  Several media reports on Wednesday said senior US officials were attempting to broker a short-term pause in fighting between the two sides.  French President Emmanuel Macron met with US President Joe Biden at the UN General Assembly in New York to discuss efforts to secure a ceasefire. Shortly after the talks, France said the two countries were proposing a ""temporary ceasefire"" of 21 days ""to allow for negotiations"".  ""There cannot be a war in Lebanon. This is why we urge Israel to cease this escalation in Lebanon and to Hezbollah to cease this missile launch to Israel,"" Mr Macron told the UN.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an immediate ceasefire, and said ""hell is breaking loose"".  Lebanese PM Najib Mikati said his country is ""facing a blatant violation of our sovereignty and human rights through the brutal practices of the Israeli enemy"".  He added he hoped he could leave the UN session with a ""serious solution"" to ""put pressure on Israel to achieve an immediate ceasefire on all fronts"". Asked by Reuters if a ceasefire can be reached soon, he responded: ""Hopefully, yes."" Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said it was grateful for diplomatic efforts to avoid escalation but would use ""all use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our aims"".  He said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war"", and has made its desire for peace ""clear"". Mr Danon added that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will arrive in New York on Thursday, have bilaterial meetings later that day and speak at the General Assembly the following morning. Cross-border fighting continued on Wednesday, with Hezbollah saying it had targeted the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency with a missile fired towards Tel Aviv - the first time Hezbollah has targeted the heavily populated area. It was intercepted by air defences and there were no reports of damage or casualties. The launcher was subsequently destroyed in an air strike, the IDF said. IDF spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said the missile was heading “towards civilian areas in Tel Aviv”, noting that “the Mossad headquarters is not in that area”. Hezbollah also fired dozens more rockets into northern Israel, injuring two.  Meanwhile, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets had hit more than 280 “Hezbollah terror targets” in the latest wave of air strikes on Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters that the strikes had killed at least 51 people and injured 223, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. The health ministry reported deadly Israeli attacks in southern areas including Joun, in the Chouf mountains near the southern city of Sidon, as well as Maaysrah, in another mountainous area north of Beirut, and in the north of the Bekaa Valley.  More than 600 people have been reported killed across Lebanon since Monday, when Israel began an intense air campaign to destroy what it said was infrastructure built up by Hezbollah since they last fought a war in 2006. Another 90,000 people in Lebanon have been newly displaced, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes before the escalation, according to the UN. Almost 40,000 are living in shelters across the country. Nearly a year of deadly cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza has also displaced around 70,000 people in northern Israel, whose safe return the Israeli government and military say they want to ensure. Hezbollah says it is attacking Israel in support of its Palestinian ally, Hamas, and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. It comes after an unprecedented wave of attacks on Hezbollah. Last week, 39 people were killed and thousands were wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members to communicate exploded in two waves across Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for the attacks. Then, an Israeli air strike on Friday on the group’s stronghold of Dahieh, in southern Beirut, essentially wiped out the chain of command of its main fighting unit, the Radwan Force. The group confirmed that one of its top military leaders, Ibrahim Aqil, was among 55 people killed."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30lj9m300vo,Lebanon hospitals close as Israeli strikes hit health facilities,The World Health Organisation says at least 37 facilities have shut and dozens of medical staff have died.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:29.780959,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least four hospitals in Lebanon announced on Friday that they were suspending work because of Israeli strikes, while a Hezbollah-affiliated health organisation said that 11 paramedics had been killed in the past 24 hours. The four closures capped two weeks of Israeli strikes on hospitals and healthcare workers in Lebanon that have shuttered at least 37 facilities and killed dozens of medical staff, according to the World Health Organisation. Late on Friday night, the Israeli army issued a statement alleging that Hezbollah was using medical vehicles to transport fighters and weapons, warning that it would strike any vehicle it suspected of being used for military purposes. Hospital staff in southern Lebanon told the BBC that health facilities treating wounded civilians had been hit with direct Israeli strikes. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment. Dr Mounes Kalakish, director of the Marjayoun governmental hospital in southern Lebanon, told the BBC that the hospital had no choice but to close on Friday after an airstrike hit two ambulances at the hospital’s entrance way on Friday, killing seven paramedics. “The nurses and doctors were terrified,” he said. “We tried to calm them and carry on working, but it was not possible.” The emergency director of the hospital, Dr Shoshana Mazraani, said she was sitting at the front of the building when the strike happened. She said that she heard the cries of the paramedics who were hit and ran towards the damaged ambulances, but was warned to stay back by colleagues fearful of a follow up strike. The Marjayoun hospital had already been hanging on by a thread, Dr Mazraani said, with a core team of just 20 doctors remaining from the centre’s usual 120 staff. The closure on Friday was a “tragedy for the region”, she said. “We serve a huge population here, many villages. We had 45 inpatient beds, all now empty. We were the only hospital providing dialysis in the region, for example. We have had to turn away emergency patients and tell others to leave.” Rita Suleiman, the nursing director at the Saint Therese hospital, on the edge of Beirut’s southern suburbs, told the BBC that the hospital had also struggled on after being badly damaged by a strike on Friday but was later forced to suspend all services. Other hospitals were carrying on with severely limited services. Dr Mohammed Hamadeh, director of the Tebnine hospital, told the BBC on Friday a nearby strike had rocked the building. “The blast was very close,” he said. “We are still trying to operate but we cannot leave the confines of the hospital because it is too dangerous.” Late on Friday night, the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil announced it had closed after being “violently shelled”, following an order from the Israeli army to evacuate. The Israeli army said it was targeting a mosque adjacent to the hospital which it claimed was being used by Hezbollah fighters. The strikes on healthcare facilities have not been limited to the south of Lebanon. Israel hit a medical centre in central Beirut on Thursday belonging to the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Organisation, killing nine and wounding 14. The Israeli army said the strike targeted ""terror assets"". The Lebanese Red Cross said on Thursday that four of its paramedics were wounded in a strike on a convoy evacuating patients, despite the organisation co-ordinating with the Israeli army.  Gabriel Karlsson, country manager in Beirut for the British Red Cross, told the BBC: ""Health and aid workers must be able to help those in need without fearing for their own safety. Teams from the Red Cross and Red Crescent are a lifeline, supporting communities tirelessly - they must be protected.” World Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday that 28 healthcare workers had been killed in Lebanon over the previous 24 hours, and many other healthcare staff were no longer reporting for work because of the strikes.  Dr Kalakish, the director of the Marjayoun hospital, told the BBC that prior to the strike that closed his hospital it was already operating with no anaesthesiologist or other specialists. Some staff had fled the bombardment for their own safety, he said, while others had been prevented from reaching the hospital because of air strikes on nearby roads. Lebanon's Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Thursday that 97 rescue workers had been killed since Hezbollah and Israel began fighting last October. More than 40 of those – paramedics and firefighters – were in just three days this past week, he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj31rgz511no,Iran warns Hezbollah leader's death 'will not go unavenged',"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announces five days of mourning in response to the “martyrdom"" of his ally.",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:35.055482,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Iran’s supreme leader has said the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah ""will not go unavenged"", a day after he was killed in an Israeli air strike in Lebanon. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced five days of mourning in Iran in response to what he called the ""martyrdom of the great Nasrallah"", describing him as ""a path and a school of thought"" that would continue. Iranian media reported that a Iranian Revolutionary Guards general was also killed in the Israeli strikes in Beirut on Friday. Israel’s military said Nasrallah had ""the blood of thousands... on his hands"", and that it targeted him while he was ""commanding more imminent attacks"". There are fears that the strike could plunge the wider region into war, after nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the 7 October attacks and war in the Gaza Strip. Key to what happens next in the Middle East is what Ayatollah Khamenei decides. So far, he and other senior Iranian figures have refrained from vowing to retaliate for the series of severe and humiliating blows that Israel has dealt Hezbollah in recent weeks, seemingly because Iran does not want a war with its arch-enemy. Iran also has not carried out its threat to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, which Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US, UK and other countries. Earlier on Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei urged Muslims to stand by Hezbollah ""with their resources and help"" but did not promise to retaliate for the strike that killed Nasrallah. ""The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront,"" he said. Reuters news agency meanwhile cited two regional officials as saying that the supreme leader had been transferred to a secure location inside Iran with heightened security measures. They also said Iran was in constant contact with Hezbollah and other allies to determine their next steps, according to the report. Friday’s Israeli strike levelled several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahieh, underneath which the Israeli military said Hezbollah’s central headquarters was located. Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s death on Saturday. But it did not comment on the Israeli military’s claim that Ali Karaki, the head of the group’s Southern Front, and other commanders were killed alongside Nasrallah. Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of operations for Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), was also ""martyred"" in Dahiyeh on Friday, according to the IRGC-linked Saberin News outlet. It provided nor further details, although the moderate Didban news website said he was ""assassinated along with"" Nasrallah. However, there has been no official confirmation from Iranian authorities. Iran uses the IRGC to provide Hezbollah with most of its funding, training and weapons, which have allowed the Shia Islamist group to build a military wing stronger than the Lebanese army. The US says the IRGC also oversees the co-ordination of Iran’s network of allied armed groups across the Middle East, which are all opposed to the US and Israel and sometimes refer to themselves as the “Axis of Resistance”. Besides Hezbollah, they include Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria. On Saturday, there were air raid sirens in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after the Houthis launched a missile in support of Hezbollah. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias, also claimed new drone attacks on northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, said Iran’s reputation among its allies was ""certainly damaged"" and that it would be “looking for some way to turn the tables and save some face”. “This could result in a co-ordinated axis response, including from Iraq and the Houthis, or another direct Iranian strike on Israel itself,"" she said. “By maintaining pressure or even escalating, Tehran is aware that this will invite further attacks, but it will choose to do so keep pressure on Israel."""

Due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the UK Foreign Office earlier this week urged Britons to leave the Middle East country as quickly as possible. Mahasen al-Dada, who moved to Lebanon from Manchester in 2023, said her husband could not leave because he had to care for his disabled father. She was able to return to the UK on Wednesday with her children on a government-chartered flight from Beirut to Birmingham. Mrs al-Dada, a psychology and criminology graduate, told the BBC her emotions were ""all over the place"" after the couple decided she would leave. She said they made the decision for the safety and future of their children who were no longer able to go to school because of the worsening security situation. ""I've been crying for two days,"" she said. ""The children were crying and asking me questions I couldn't even answer. My six-year-old is so little he's not going understand to how visas work and how war happens. ""But it's for the safety and future of our children, they should be in school."" Israel has stepped up its aerial assault of Beirut in the past week, targeting areas in the city's south that it said was home to Hezbollah leaders and military equipment. It comes after Hezbollah launched rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"" as fighting continues. Mrs al-Dada said she was notified that a flight was available on Monday but had to wait until the following day for seats to be confirmed. ""We're doing well now my kids are feeling a little bit better. They're less stressed now,"" she said. ""My mum was so happy we're back. My dad hasn't been sleeping. He was up watching the news and ringing to check we're ok."" She said she hopes her husband may be able to join the family in the UK soon. She said he applied for a visa on Wednesday and a note has been placed on his file to show he has a family in the UK. Mrs al-Dada said he was initially hesitant to leave his parents and siblings behind, but seeing how upset their children were changed his mind. ""He got really emotional and I think it changed his mind,"" she said. ""He said he just wants to visit, even if it means he'll be coming here and going back."" Mrs al-Dada said she felt selfish for leaving loved ones behind and hoped to return to Lebanon when possible. ""I feel like I made the right decision for my children. I'm happy that I have another place to call home. I'm Lebanese but I'm British as well, and I'm lucky that I have a government that cares for me,"" she continued. ""I feel a bit selfish that I had to leave loved ones behind. Other people would love to be in my place and have somewhere else to leave to but they can't they have to stay in basically a war zone. ""I hope that things will get better in Lebanon, it's my second country and I would love to go back with my children but to go back to a safe country.""

In March, the PFA called for a vote at Fifa's congress in May to suspend Israel because of the war in Gaza. At the time, the president of world football's governing body Gianni Infantino said, following a legal assessment, that it was a matter for the Fifa Council to make a decision on. The council is the main decision-making body of the organisation that governs world football. Thursday's Fifa Council meeting has listed a ""proposal submitted by the Palestine Football Association at the 74th Fifa congress"" on its agenda. The Palestine FA believes Israel's federation has committed ""violations of Fifa regulations"" and wants sanctions against the country's ""national teams and clubs"". Shino Moshe Zuares, the president of the IFF, has previously said: ""We are facing a cynical political and hostile attempt by the Palestinian association to harm Israeli football."" Israel are playing their home matches in the Nations League in Hungary, while an away game against Belgium last month was also moved to the country because of security concerns. They are scheduled to host France and play in Italy during the international break in October. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Since the attack, a military campaign in Gaza has killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Fifa Council will meet amid Israel launching a ground invasion in southern Lebanon against the armed group Hezbollah, while Iran has launched more than 180 missiles towards Israel.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9q40e91no,Starmer steps up call for ceasefire in Lebanon,"The prime minister urged Israel and Hezbollah to ""stop the violence"" in his first speech to the UN General Assembly.",27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:35.329826,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Sir Keir Starmer has stepped up his call for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon following an escalation in fighting between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah.  ""Stop the violence. Step back from the brink,"" the prime minister said in his maiden speech to the UN General Assembly, despite Israeli ministers’ rejection of an international proposal for a temporary pause in fighting. Sir Keir told world leaders a ceasefire would provide space for a diplomatic settlement to avoid a regional conflict in the Middle East. Fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah are at a high, following the deadliest escalation of cross-border attacks in decades. More than 600 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon since Monday, including at least 92 people on Thursday, according to local authorities. Hezbollah has responded by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel. Israeli politicians have broadly rejected the idea of a ceasefire after a 12-strong bloc - including the UK, US and other allies proposed a three-week pause in fighting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the country's military to continue fighting with ""full force"" as he landed in New York on Thursday. Addressing the UN General Assembly there, Sir Keir said an immediate ceasefire was needed ""to provide space for a diplomatic settlement"". He warned that the conflict could spill over into a war ""no-one can control and with consequences that none of us can foresee"". Elsewhere in his speech, Sir Keir vowed to return the UK to “responsible global leadership” by recommitting to “the UN, to internationalism, to the rule of law”.  He also promised to restore Britain’s “commitment to international development”, and set out plans to change the international financial system “to deliver a fairer deal for developing countries"". Around 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from the north of the country since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began, sparked by the war in Gaza. In Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, in addition to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN. The UK has urged British nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately because of the escalation, however some have told the BBC of their difficulty in fleeing the country.  Cross-border fighting continued on Thursday, with the Israeli army saying it had struck Hezbollah targets in parts of Lebanon's south and east, and on the Lebanese-Syrian border. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had fired 50 rockets towards the Kiryat Ata settlement, and 80 missiles towards the city of Safed, both in northern Israel. Israel’s military chief told troops on Wednesday that strikes targeting Hezbollah could pave the way for them to “enter enemy territory”. The remarks by Lt Gen Herzi Halevi were the plainest indication yet from a senior figure that a ground invasion into Lebanon may be imminent."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl2x3ye8no,Witness describes 'roar then explosion' from Israeli strikes on Beirut that killed 22,"The attacks on Thursday evening have killed 22 and wounded 117, the Lebanese health ministry says.",3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:27:35.423775,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Amid acrid smoke and cries from residents, rescue workers were searching Friday morning for signs of anyone left trapped in the rubble from two Israeli air strikes that hit central Beirut overnight. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, 22 people died and 117 were wounded, making these the deadliest strikes in central Beirut of the recent escalation. At the site of the heaviest of the two, in the Shia neighbourhood of Basta, the head of the Civil Defence rescue team Youssef Al-Mallah told the BBC that five people were still unaccounted for. The Civil Defence has appealed for family members of the missing to come forward with any information on their whereabouts, Al-Mallah said. Unconfirmed reports Friday said that Wafiq Safa, the head of Hezbollah’s liaison and coordination unit, was the target of one of the strikes but managed to survive. Israeli authorities have not commented. They issued no warnings ahead of the strikes, as they have in some instances. Both the strikes on Beirut hit residential buildings in densely packed neighbourhoods. The missile that hit Basta fell close to the site of an earlier strike that killed nine people last week. It destroyed a four-storey building completely and severely damaged or destroyed at least three adjacent buildings. The other strike, on the mostly Shia neighbourhood of Nweiri, hit the third floor of an eight-storey building, ejecting large pieces of rubble into the street and destroying cars and shopfronts below. The timing of the strikes - at about 20:00 local time, 18:00 BST - meant that many residents of the neighbourhoods were at home or on the street in the vicinity. Hassan Jaafar, a 22-year-old security guard, was at home with friends just 50m from the Basta strike. He told the BBC they heard a ""roar that seemed to grow closer with every second"".  ""The shockwave knocked us off our feet, sending us backwards as dust and debris filled the air,"" he said. ""For a moment, everything vanished in a cloud of ash."" Jaafar said he and his friends were bruised and cut in the strike by flying debris and glass. ""In that moment, it felt like the war had expanded into our lives,"" he said. On the massive pile of rubble left by the strike on Friday morning, distraught residents looked on at their destroyed apartments and pleaded with members of the Civil Defence team to help them retrieve surviving possessions. One group of women was searching for a missing relative - a mother of young children who was last seen on a stretcher at the site. The Civil Defence team told the group they needed to check at every hospital in person.  “If she left here on a gurney she will be at a hospital somewhere,” a rescue worker said. Ibtisam Mazloum, 42, was in her building nearby when the strike hit. “If they want to fight they should fight at the border,” she said, angrily. “The civilians in Beirut are not part of this.” At the site of the Nweiri strike, Musa Araf, who works for the Civil Defence, described being in his apartment on the sixth floor of the target building when the missile hit. “I didn’t panic because of my job, I am used to it,” he said. “But my children were screaming and clinging on to me. One of my grandchildren was cut by flying glass.” This is the third time Israel has launched air strikes on Beirut outside of the city’s southern suburb of Dahieh, where the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah has a strong presence. The previous strikes on central Beirut targeted members of Hezbollah and the People’s Front for the Liberation of Palestine, according to the IDF. One hit a health clinic which the IDF described as Hezbollah-affiliated and killed nine people. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch called on Friday for an inquiry into Israeli attacks on UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon. Reports said that an observation post belonging to the United Nations peacekeeping mission (Unifil) had been fired at by Israeli forces. The incident would mark the fourth time in recent days that Israeli troops have fired at Unifil bases. Yesterday, two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured after an Israeli tank fired at a watchtower at the force's headquarters in Ras al-Naqoura. Hezbollah said on Friday it had launched an attack on an Israeli military base in the northern city of Haifa using explosive-laden drones. The Iran-backed group said the attack was a retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgxqp81lxxo,"Israeli strike on Gaza school kills at least 11, health ministry says",The Israeli military says it targeted a Hamas “command-and-control centre” inside al-Faluja school.,26 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:35.613092,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 11 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school in northern Gaza being used as a shelter by displaced families, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Women and children were among the dead brought to hospitals following the attack on al-Faluja school in the urban Jabalia refugee camp, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said a “precise"" strike targeted a “command-and-control centre” used by Hamas fighters. The armed group has previously denied operating inside schools. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said thousands of displaced Palestinians were living at al-Faluja school and put the death toll at 15. Local medics meanwhile told Reuters news agency that at least 14 people were killed. One resident, Rami Abdul Nabi, said the school was hit by two missiles and that it felt “like an earthquake” as they exploded. ""This should be... a place for the displaced to find a sanctuary, people who have no options left,” he told Reuters. “It was a shocking massacre."" Many schools have been turned into shelters for the 1.9 million Palestinians who have fled their homes since the war between Israel and Hamas started almost a year ago. However, at least 61% of schools have been directly hit during the conflict and another 24% have been damaged, according to satellite analysis by the UN and its partners. Three other schools in northern and central Gaza were struck by Israeli aircraft between last Saturday and Monday, reportedly killing at least 32 people. As with Thursday’s strike in Jabalia camp, the Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas command centres and that it had taken steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. It also accused Hamas of systematically violating international law by operating from inside civilian infrastructure. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 41,150 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a rival of Hamas who is based in the occupied West Bank - appealed to world leaders to end the war. ""Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel. This madness cannot continue,” he said. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, condemned the speech, saying that Abbas “did not say the word ‘Hamas’ once”. “Since the massacre of 7 October, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,” he added. The US, Egypt and Qatar are trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal, which they also see as key to de-escalating the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. However, US officials have admitted the negotiations have stalled in recent weeks."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwylekwngz8o,UN says Israeli tanks forced entry into base in south Lebanon,It comes as PM Netanyahu demands the peacekeeping force leave the area.,17 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:27:35.704746,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon says Israeli tanks forced their way into one of its positions early on Sunday morning. In a statement, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said two Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tanks destroyed the main gate of a post in Ramyah, near the Israeli border, and ""forcibly entered the position"" to request it turn out its lights. About two hours later, it said rounds were fired nearby that saw smoke enter the camp, causing 15 peacekeepers to suffer skin irritations and gastrointestinal reactions. The IDF offered a different version of events, saying it had encroached on a Unifil position to evacuate soldiers who had been wounded by an anti-tank missile. It said two soldiers had been ""seriously injured"" in the attack, with others suffering lesser degrees of injury. ""For the sake of evacuating the wounded, two tanks drove backwards, in a place where they could not advance otherwise in light of the threat of shooting, a few metres towards the Unifil position,"" the IDF said. It added that during the incident, a smoke screen was fired to aid the evacuation - and that it had ""maintained continuous contact"" with Unifil, stressing there was ""no threat to the Unifil force from IDF activities"". UN secretary general António Guterres warned any attacks on peacekeepers ""may constitute a war crime"", adding that ""Unifil personnel and its premises must never be targeted"". ""Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law, including international humanitarian law,"" Mr Guterres said, according to a statement from his spokesman. The incident is the latest in a growing number of encounters between Unifil and Israeli forces. Israel has repeatedly urged the peacekeeping force to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon where fighting was taking place, after it began a ground incursion on 30 September targeting the armed group Hezbollah. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Unifil to ""immediately"" get its troops ""out of harm's way"" in a video statement issued by his office on Sunday, claiming that their presence in the region made them ""hostages of Hezbollah"". Unifil has so far refused these requests. Israel has faced international condemnation for previous instances in which Unifil troops have been injured in southern Lebanon - with the IDF admitting responsibility for firing toward UN posts in some cases. Unifil said: ""For the fourth time in as many days, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times."" It described the breach of its post in Ramyah as ""a further flagrant violation of international law"". Unifil added that on Saturday Israeli troops had blocked them from carrying out a ""critical"" logistical movement near Meiss El Jebel, also near the border. The IDF has yet to comment on that incident. But it alleged that Hezbollah had fired around 25 rockets and missiles in the last month from sites located near Unifil sites. It accused the armed group of ""exploiting their proximity to UN forces"". Hezbollah and Israel have been trading near daily cross-border fire since last October, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel. Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from 50 countries are stationed in Lebanon, alongside around 800 civilian staff. Since 1978, they have patrolled the area between the Litani River and the UN-recognised boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the ""Blue Line"". Israel has previously asked Unifil to withdraw north by 5km (3 miles).  Prior to Sunday's incidents, five peacekeepers had been injured in recent days. On Saturday, Unifil said a soldier had been shot at its headquarters in the city of Naquora - though it did not know the origin of the bullet. The day before, the IDF said its troops were responsible for an incident in which two Unifil troops from Sri Lanka were injured. On Thursday, two Indonesian Unifil soldiers were injured falling from an observation tower after an Israeli tank fired towards it. Those incidents prompted rebukes from several of Israel's allies, including France, Italy and Spain. A Downing Street spokesperson said the UK was ""appalled"". In his comments on Sunday, Netanyahu said European leaders should direct their criticism towards Hezbollah, not Israel. Israel argues that Unifil has failed to stabilise the region and prevent Hezbollah fighters from operating south of the Litani River - among the reasons for a UN presence there. It has previously said that it was acting on a 2004 UN resolution calling for the disbanding of Lebanese and non-Lebanese militant groups, and that its request for peacekeepers to withdraw was so it could confront Hezbollah. Netanyahu said these appeals had been ""met with refusals"", and that Unifil was providing a ""human shield to Hezbollah terrorists"". ""This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers,"" he added. ""We regret the injuring of Unifil soldiers and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injuring. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone."" Unifil officials have repeatedly refused to withdraw troops from the region.  The body's spokesman Andrea Tenenti told the AFP news agency on Saturday that there had been a ""unanimous decision to stay because it's important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region"".  Lebanon's Prime Minister Nijab Mikati condemned Netanyahu's position.  In a statement, he said the Israeli PM's comments represented ""a new chapter in the enemy's approach of not complying with international legitimacy"". Mikati urged other nations ""to take a firm position that stops the Israeli aggression""."

Dr Firass Abiad told the BBC it was “clear” that many of the 550 people killed in Monday’s attacks were civilians, including children and women. Israel said it hit hundreds of Hezbollah sites, accusing the group of hiding weapons in residential areas. On Tuesday, the Israeli military killed the head of Hezbollah’s rocket forces as the strikes continued, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the group was leading Lebanon “to the edge of the abyss”. Hezbollah responded by firing more than 300 rockets into northern Israel, injuring six people, according to the military. Although neither side seemed interested in backing down, US President Joe Biden told the UN General Assembly that a full-scale conflict was “not in anyone's interest” and insisted that a “diplomatic solution is still possible”. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the world “cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza”. Nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the war in Gaza has killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Monday’s Israeli air strikes across southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley had resulted in the deadliest day in the country since at least 2006 - the last time Hezbollah and Israel fought a war. Abiad told a news conference on Tuesday that 50 children, 94 women and a number of medical workers were among the 558 people killed. More than 50 hospitals were currently treating the 1,835 other people who were wounded, he added. Later, in an interview with the BBC, the health minister described what happened as “carnage.” “If you look at the people who were brought to the emergency rooms it’s clear that they’re civilians. They are not the combatants that the Israelis claim they are,” he said. “We know about the victims of the attacks because our ambulances are the ones that transferred them to hospitals,” he added. “[They were] civilians who were doing their normal things.” When comparing the current hostilities with the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, Abiad said: “Definitely we’re looking at a more cruel war, especially in the way civilians are being targeted.” The UN Human Rights Office also expressed alarm at the number of casualties in Monday’s strikes, saying they could have violated international humanitarian law. When asked by journalists about the audio and text messages sent by the Israeli military to people in Lebanon, telling them to evacuate areas near buildings where Hezbollah stored weapons, spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said: “Telling civilians to flee doesn't make it ok to then strike those areas, knowing full well that the impact on civilians will be huge.” Roads in southern Lebanon were also congested for a second day, as thousands more people fled north to get away from the Israeli attacks. Journeys that would usually take an hour were lasting 12 or more. At a shelter in Beirut, 65-year-old Maryam told the BBC that she had travelled all night with 12 relatives in one small car. “We got together and left. We didn’t want to leave our homes, because leaving your home is difficult,” she said. “We arrived here at four in the morning. With our children. It’s because of our children that we left.” During a visit to an intelligence base, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would “continue striking Hezbollah” until it had achieved its war goal of returning displaced Israeli civilians to their homes along the northern border. He also addressed the people of Lebanon, insisting that “our war is not with you” and warning them that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was ""leading you to the edge of the abyss”. “I told you yesterday to evacuate homes in which there is a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage. Whoever has a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage will no longer have a home,” he said. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told an evening briefing that Hezbollah had turned southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley “into a combat zone” and that aircraft had continued to strike targets there throughout Tuesday. He also released video footage that he said showed secondary explosions during strikes on residential buildings that indicated missiles and a truck carrying a rocket launcher had been stored inside them. Hagari also said the head of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket unit, Ibrahim Qubaisi, had been killed in an air strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday afternoon, along with at least two other commanders who were with him at the time. Qubaisi was “a key figure in activating missiles” and was “responsible for a series of attacks on Israeli territory”, he added. Hezbollah confirmed in a Telegram post that Qubaisi had been ""martyred"" in a strike. The Lebanese health ministry said six people were killed and 15 others injured in an “Israeli enemy raid” that partly destroyed the top two floors of a block of flats in Beirut’s Ghobeiry neighbourhood. Hezbollah said that its fighters had fired barrages of rockets towards more than a dozen Israeli towns and military bases, as well as an explosives factory. It also claimed that a new type of rocket had been used to strike the IDF’s Samson unit. Sirens continued to sound throughout the day across northern Israel and interceptor rockets from Israel’s Iron Dome air defence system were seen streaking into the sky. Some of the approximately 300 rockets landed, causing damage and injuring six civilians and soldiers, most of them lightly, according to Hagari."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx250ygn9ddo,Oil price rise comes at a critical point,Any extended rise raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and gas and electricity bills.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:43.216206,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The price of oil has jumped 5% after US President Joe Biden said the US was discussing possible strikes by Israel on Iran’s oil industry. Asked on a visit if he would support Israel striking Iran’s oil facilities, Biden said: “We’re discussing that."" Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, exporting around half its production abroad, mainly to China. Since Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Monday, the price of benchmark Brent crude oil has risen 10% to $77 a barrel, although this remains below levels seen earlier this year. Any extended rise in energy prices raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and increased gas and electricity bills, pushing up the rate of inflation. So far this year, weaker demand from China and ample supply from Saudi Arabia have acted to hold down oil prices. The reaction in oil markets has, so far, been far more muted than, for example, to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But the escalation of violence in the Middle East and threat of further action is now stalking the markets. Of particular concern is whether any escalation could block the Straits of Hormuz, through which a third of oil tanker traffic and a fifth of LNG frozen gas has to pass. Since Russia’s war with Ukraine began, the world has become more dependent on shipped frozen gas in LNG tankers. Even if it is Asia that is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, the immediate price impact of such developments would be significant. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Thursday of the “very serious” potential impact and that he was watching developments “extremely closely”. All this could come at the very moment the world’s central bankers declared a quiet victory over the three-year inflation shock from the pandemic and Ukraine war. It may help explain why G7 leaders are trying to moderate the expected response from Israel to Iran’s attack."

The Sun's headline calls them ""hell fire"", the Daily Mirror describes the attacks as ""revenge from above"" and the Times says simply ""Middle East erupts"". The I paper warns the assault ""sparks fears"" of a ""new war"". The Daily Mail's special correspondent, David Patrikarakos, says ""the only surprise"" was that the Iranian attack had not ""come sooner"". By splitting resources between two fronts in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel is, he says, embarking on a ""hard and brutal road"". And he warns a regional, and possibly global, war is now ""all too real"". The Times suggests there will be much scrutiny of one disputed fact - whether or not the US was able to warn Israel about the missiles. Iran's representative office at the UN in New York is said to have originally denied alerting the US to the attack. But it later admitted there had been a notification. This, the Times suggests, would make it seem ""Iran is still reluctant to take Israel head on"". There is a suggestion from an unnamed source in the Financial Times that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not want Tehran involved in his fight against Hezbollah. Separately, former deputy head of Israel's National Security Council Itamar Yaar tells the paper he thinks it is very unlikely Israel would attack Iran's nuclear facilities without US support, something he suspects would not be forthcoming in the next few months. The Daily Mirror warns intense international diplomacy is failing but says abandoning hope is not an option. In its editorial, the Daily Express also urges that ""military action must not be divorced from diplomacy"". A note of caution is sounded in the Guardian's editorial that Netanyahu has no clear exit strategy. It says without a diplomatic process, there are few limits to the crisis - only what the Guardian calls a ""dangerous, fast‑growing, open-ended conflict"". Concerns about Israeli ""mission creep"" that could lead the entire Middle East into war are also raised in the Daily Telegraph's leader column. However it says Tehran is the main cause of the region's instability and US President Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer should decide what to do about Iran, not Israel. Whitehall sources tell the Guardian that despite the promises of Chancellor Rachel Reeves to invest to grow the economy, ministers are being asked by Treasury officials to find ways to cut infrastructure project costs by up to 10%. The Treasury has declined to comment on the spending review process. And finally dog owners are told in the Times their pets may have influenced the way they address them. A study suggests humans make between four and seven different sounds a second - while dogs, when they are barking, growling and whining, make only two different noises a second on average. Canines apparently also process sounds at a more leisurely rate. The study indicates the pets respond better if ""sit"" and ""come"" are said slowly, and this has encouraged owners to speak at a pace their dogs' brains can handle.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv0ne41pzo,US says it helped Israel shoot down Iran missiles,"US President Joe Biden says the US ""actively"" supported Israel's defence at his direction.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:43.474698,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The US fired about a dozen interceptors at Tuesday's  barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles fired at Israel, the Pentagon says. US President Joe Biden said the US ""actively"" supported Israel's defence at his direction. He said he had spent the morning in the Situation Room - the White House hub for handling serious national security issues. The Israeli military said about 180 missiles were fired at Israel, most of which were intercepted.  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has defended the attack, calling it a ""decisive"" response ""in defence of Iranian interests and citizens"". In a Pentagon press briefing on Tuesday, Maj Gen Patrick Ryder said two US Navy destroyers fired the interceptors at the missiles, which the US believed were all launched from Iran. He did not confirm whether they hit any of the Iranian missiles used in the attack - adding that this information was yet to be determined. Iran launched around 180 missiles towards Israel, the Israeli military said. That would make it slightly larger than a barrage in April when Tehran launched about 110 ballistic missiles and 30 cruise missiles fired towards Israel. Maj Gen Ryder added that the Pentagon was not aware of any warning for the attack. President Biden said the US was ""fully supportive"" of Israel after Wednesday's assault. ""Today, at my direction, the United States military actively supported the defence of Israel, and we're still assessing the impact,"" he said. ""But based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. And this is testament to the Israeli military capability and the US military."" Asked by reporters what the response towards Iran would be, Biden said: ""That's in active discussion right now. That remains to be seen."" He said he would be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his message ""would depend on what we finally conclude is needed"". The region is now well into a further sharp cycle of escalation, precisely the scenario Biden has spent months trying to avert - attempting to stem the Gaza war engulfing the rest of the region, while keeping up an almost continuous supply of arms to Israel. Earlier, White House national security spokesman Jake Sullivan described Iran's attack as a ""significant escalation"". He told reporters: ""We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case."" Mr Sullivan did not specify what such consequences might be, but he did not urge restraint by Israel as the US did after April's attack by Iran. US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington had attempted to use both deterrence and diplomacy to de-escalate the region. Pressed by the BBC on whether it was still taking this approach when working with the Israelis on the response to Iran, he said of course - they were always using both deterrence and diplomacy. Iran's armed forces warned against any direct military intervention in support of Israel. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement that the attacks were in response to Israel's killing of a top IRGC commander and leaders of Iran-backed militias in the region. It mentioned the killings of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoshan in Lebanon last weekend. It also referred to the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.  While Israel has not admitted involvement in Haniyeh's death, it is widely believed to be responsible."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje3zl0dq2ko,Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu is trying to sway US election,Some Democrats accuse Israel's PM of holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal for political reasons.,5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:43.568156,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"President Joe Biden has said he is unsure whether Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal in order to influence next month's US election. He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: ""Whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know - but I’m not counting on that.” Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: “No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,"" he said. ""And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that."" Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November. Earlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: “I don’t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel’s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s actions, as connected to the American election."" Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.  The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel’s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November.  Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close. A deal before the election would be a major boost for the president and the Democratic Party but appears increasingly unlikely.  While the Biden administration has mostly criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has rejected suggestions from Washington that an agreement is close.  ""Hamas is not there with a deal. There’s not a deal in the making, unfortunately,” the Israeli prime minister said earlier this month just hours after a US official said it was 90% complete. The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. It has also vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack this week. At his appearance at Friday's press briefing, which came as a shock to  reporters in the room as it was his first since becoming president four years ago, Biden responded to concern that Israel could strike Iranian oil fields in retaliation.  ""The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike,"" he said. ""If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields."" Biden caused oil prices to rise on Thursday when he said the US was discussing with Israel the possibility of strikes on Iran’s oil infrastructure."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4xnq2zqlgo,Biden struggles to contain conflict as Israel and Hezbollah on the brink,"As the US president called for restraint in a speech at the UN, Israel's leader vowed to continue striking Hezbollah.",24 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:43.664254,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden has spent nearly a year vowing his determination to prevent the war in Gaza engulfing the wider Middle East. On Tuesday, he repeated that resolve in his last ever United Nations speech as president, as he addressed the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. “A diplomatic solution is still possible. In fact, remains the only path to lasting security,” Biden said. “Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,” he added. But the Israel-Lebanon crisis is now on the brink. And Biden’s calls for restraint from the podium of the UN, like his pleas for Israel and Hamas to finally reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal, are being heard in the hall but not in the region. On Monday, Israel unleashed hundreds of airstrikes on Lebanon, inflicting the deadliest day on the country since the end of its bloody, sectarian civil war more than three decades ago. Israel’s bombardment killed more than 500 people, according to Lebanese health officials.  Hezbollah, the Iran-backed armed group that dominates the country – reeling and damaged from Israel’s wave of exploding pager attacks last week - launched hundreds of rockets into northern Israel, smashing homes and setting streets ablaze. Once again the US is trying to restrain Israel, the key regional ally it arms, and urging its adversaries against escalating too, all the while seeking a diplomatic outcome that the sides themselves lack either the ability or will to agree. Israel says it’s acting to disarm the Lebanese militia so Israeli residents can return to their homes in the north. Hezbollah says it’s been striking Israel for the past 11 months to deter and degrade Israeli attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Months of shuttle diplomacy by the US envoy Amos Hochstein - building on already established UN Security Resolutions on Israel and Hezbollah - have come to nothing. Instead, in another split screen moment as Biden was urging calm at the podium at the UN, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a video on X vowing: ""We will continue to hit Hezbollah. He who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his garage - he will not have a home."" The White House supports what it calls Israel’s right to hit Hezbollah. But the often dysfunctional political relationship with the Israeli leadership has again become apparent over recent weeks, amid serious concerns in the administration that the exploding pager attacks and subsequent Israeli airstrikes could lead to all out war.  No call between Biden and Netanyahu was announced despite the crisis of the last week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently made his tenth trip to the region since the 7 October attacks but for the first time did not visit Israel. Critics both within and outside the administration have repeatedly blamed an inability of the White House to wield influence over Netanyahu on a failure to condition US weapons supply. The administration categorically rejects this, saying it is committed to Israel’s defence. President Biden always believed the key to solving the crisis on the Israel-Lebanon border, involving 11 months of cross border fire and tens of thousands of people displaced on either side, was instead clinching the ceasefire deal in Gaza. But this is badly stalled with few signs either side is willing to reach it. Blinken recently pinned this on a lack of “political will” by both Israel and Hamas. The White House denies that it is pursuing a diplomatic effort doomed to defeat – and that President Biden, with four months left in office, has given up hope of achieving a breakthrough. “No, he absolutely hasn’t given up,” White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of Biden’s attempts to reach a deal that would end the war in Gaza. “There have been difficulties and setbacks. We’ve had challenges getting the [Israeli] prime minister across the line. We’ve had challenges getting Hamas’s leader Sinwar across the line. But we’re determined to keep at it,” Mr Sullivan told CNN. “The president this week in New York will be huddling with other leaders to try to bring about a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza and really critically, to try and avert an all-out war in the Middle East.” Behind the scenes here in New York, a stream of diplomacy is taking place. According to a senior state department official, the US is presenting allies with potential plans to resolve the crisis between Israel and Hezbollah. “We’ve got some concrete ideas we’re going to be discussing with allies and partners this week to try to figure out the way forward on this,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Pressed on what the “concrete ideas” were, the official would not be drawn, noting instead that while the US does not speak directly to Hezbollah, some of its allies gathered in New York do and these partners “might have a more refined sense of Hezbollah thinking so we can stress test our ideas.” But the official also renewed US opposition to any Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon. And they rejected Israeli officials’ reported belief that ramping up the conflict with Hezbollah could force them into cutting a diplomatic deal that would stabilise the situation on either side of the Israel-Lebanon border – a strategy referred to as “de-escalation by escalation”. “I can't recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de escalation and led to profound stabilisation of the situation,” said the official."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24e419j8po,"UK troops didn't need to engage, says Healey",The UK defence secretary says Israel’s defences were able to deal with the threat.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:43.761329,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"UK forces were ready to engage after Iran launched ballistic missiles on Israel, but they ""didn't need to do so"", the UK defence secretary has said. John Healey, who is in Cyprus visiting military personnel, said RAF Typhoons were in the air at the time of the attack on Tuesday night, but Israel’s own defences dealt with the threat. He said the nature of the assault was different compared to April when RAF Typhoon jets based in Cyprus shot down Iranian drones. The jets are not equipped to track and target ballistic missiles. Healey said the UK's involvement was part of an effort to prevent escalation and to show the UK’s steadfast support for Israel’s security. The BBC also understands that Royal Navy Destroyer, HMS Duncan, did not fire any of her Sea Viper missiles. Healey thanked British personnel involved for their courage and professionalism. ""The UK stands fully behind Israel's right to defend its country and its people against threats."" The defence secretary said he also spoke to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant on Wednesday morning, where he said the UK condemned the Iranian attack. ""We continue to support steadfast their [Israel's] right to security, but our biggest concern is to avoid this conflict spiralling out of control and into a wider regional war,"" Healey said. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had launched the missiles on Tuesday in retaliation for recent attacks that killed the leaders of the Hezbollah and Hamas militant groups, as well as a senior Iranian commander. Israel said most of the 180 missiles fired were intercepted. US forces were also involved in helping Israel strike down Iranian missiles, confirming that two of its guided missile destroyers - USS Cole and USS Bulkeley, which are based in the eastern Mediterranean - fired a dozen interceptors at incoming missiles. Capt Bill Urban, lead spokesman for US Naval Forces Europe and Africa, said: ""Multiple missiles are believed to have been successfully engaged at this time."" Healey's visit to Cyprus will see him meet some of the British personnel preparing for the possibility of evacuating British nationals from Lebanon. Britons in Lebanon have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website and a UK-chartered plane is set to leave Beirut on Wednesday. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04depp2nro,Can diplomacy bring Middle East ceasefire? Early signs don't bode well,The new plan packages up a series of regional objectives that have remained out of reach for diplomats for nearly two decades.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:53.284611,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"After the US, the EU and 10 other counties called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the White House went into spin mode trying to build momentum for its proposal. On a late night Zoom briefing so packed with reporters that some had to be turned away, senior Biden administration officials described the announcement as a “breakthrough”. What they meant was they saw getting an agreement from key European countries and Arab states, led by Washington, as a big diplomatic achievement during the current explosive escalation But this was world powers calling for a ceasefire - not a ceasefire itself.  The statement urges both Israel and Hezbollah to stop fighting now, using a 21-day truce, “to provide space” for further mediated talks. It then urges a diplomatic settlement consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 -  adopted to end the last Israel-Lebanon war of 2006, which was never properly implemented. It also calls for agreement on the stalled Gaza ceasefire deal. Beyond the three-week truce, it packages up a series of already elusive regional objectives. Some have remained out of reach for diplomats for nearly two decades already. To issue the agreed upon text, the Americans had the advantage of world leaders gathered in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly. But what the “breakthrough” did not mean - as it has become abundantly clear on the ground - was that Israel and Hezbollah had reached an agreement. Here, it seemed like US officials were trying to present the position of the two sides as more advanced than it really was - likely an attempt to build public momentum behind the plan and to pressure both sides. Asked whether Israel and Hezbollah were onboard, one of the senior officials said: “I can share that we have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment based on the [ceasefire] call, based on our discussion - and they are familiar with the text… We'll let them speak to their actions of accepting the deal in the coming hours.” Pressed again on whether this meant Israel and Hezbollah had signed on - especially given the fact that the US does not have direct contact with Hezbollah - the official clarified that the US had talked intensively about the text with Israeli officials and with Lebanon's government (meaning its officials would have contact with Hezbollah). “Our expectation is when the government of Lebanon and when the government of Israel both accept this, this will carry and to be implemented as a ceasefire on both sides,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. That sounded pretty promising. But after the late-night call, the diplomats woke to news of more Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, including in Beirut, and more Hezbollah rocket fire into Israel. This week has seen Lebanon’s bloodiest day since its civil war; Israeli airstrikes killed more than 600 people including 50 children, according to Lebanese health officials. So how significant is the diplomacy, and can it actually lead to a ceasefire? The early signs don’t bode well. The office of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, as he boarded a flight to New York for his UN speech on Friday, issued a defiant statement saying he hadn’t agreed to anything yet. It added that he ordered Israeli military to continue fighting with “full force”.  Lebanon’s prime minister Najib Mikati dismissed reports that he signed on to the proposed ceasefire, saying they were “entirely untrue”. Instead, the joint statement creates a baseline position for the international community to try to exert pressure on Israel and Hezbollah to pull back and stop.  More work will be done in New York before the week is up. And it likely will  continue afterwards. It is significant that the Americans, leading the charge along with the French, have used the words “immediate ceasefire”. After 7 October, the US for months actively blocked resolutions from the UN Security Council calling for such a ceasefire in Gaza, until President Biden unexpectedly used the word and the US position shifted.  Since then, intensive diplomacy led by Washington has failed to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, with the US currently blaming a lack of “political will” by Hamas and Israel. Meanwhile, the US has continued to arm Israel. That doesn’t inspire confidence that Washington and its allies can now strong-arm Israel and Hezbollah into a quick truce, especially given the fighting on the ground, the intensity of Israel’s air strikes and last week’s explosive pager attacks on Hezbollah, which has continued to fire into Israel. On the other hand, the difference between this and the Gaza ceasefire is that the Israel-Lebanon agreement doesn’t involve hostage negotiations, which contributed to the deadlock over a Gaza deal.  But the objectives for each side are still very significant. Israel wants to be able to return 60,000 displaced residents from the north and maintain security there free from Lebanon's daily rocket fire.  Hezbollah seeks to stop Israeli strikes on Lebanon where more than 90,000 people also are displaced from the south.  The Shia militant group will aim to maintain its dominance in the country and its presence in the south while trying to ensure the bloody events of the last week don’t invoke more internal resentment of the group amid Lebanon’s fractious sectarian divisions. Finding agreement between these two sides has already evaded Amos Hochstein, Washington’s envoy on the Israel-Lebanon crisis, for months. And here is where the US-led desire to get an immediate truce gets complicated. My understanding of the negotiations to reach the joint statement is that Washington pushed to make sure it linked the 21-day ceasefire to creating the negotiating time for a longer-term settlement.  Namely, that the two sides negotiate to implement Resolution 1701, which implements multiple conditions on Israel and Hezbollah. These include the group’s retreat from a strip of Lebanon south of the Litani River and, in the long term, Hezbollah’s disarmament.  Ever since 2006, each side has long accused the other of breaking the terms of 1701.  All of this means that an objective, which has already evaded diplomats for nearly two decades, is now being wrapped into the short-term plan for calm between these two sides. As the missiles continue to fall, the current diplomacy is asking a lot."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20m1d77m86o,US and allies call for 21-day ceasefire across Lebanon-Israel border,"The 12-strong bloc said the situation between Israel and Hezbollah presented an ""unacceptable risk"" of broader escalation.",26 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:53.375868,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Allies including the US, UK and EU have called for a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon, following an escalation in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The 12-strong bloc proposed an immediate 21-day pause in fighting ""to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement"" and a ceasefire in Gaza. In a joint statement, they said the hostilities were ""intolerable"" and presented an ""unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation"" that was neither in the interest of the people of Israel or Lebanon. It comes after Israel’s military chief told troops on Wednesday that extensive air strikes in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah could pave the way for them to “enter enemy territory”.  The remarks by Lt Gen Halevi are the plainest indication yet from a senior figure that a ground invasion into Lebanon may be imminent. The joint statement was signed by the US, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Qatar. It followed a meeting of world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York. A separate joint statement by US President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time for a settlement ""that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes"".  The current hostilities threaten ""a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians"", they said. ""We therefore have worked together in recent days on a joint call for a temporary ceasefire to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border."" President Biden briefly spoke to reporters at the White House on Wednesday evening, saying there is ""significant support from Europe as well as the Arab nations … it’s important the war does not widen"". A senior administration official told the BBC neither Israel nor Lebanon has accepted the proposal - although the US is in touch with both governments. Official responses are expected within hours. The official said a 21-day pause in fighting would be a “sustained phase” that would allow for further negotiations to take place to reach a “complicated agreement”. They added that the US is negotiating with Lebanon’s government - rather than Hezbollah. It would then be the responsibility of the Lebanese government to engage with “non-state actors”. Earlier in New York, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an immediate ceasefire, and said ""hell is breaking loose"". Lebanese PM Najib Mikati said his country is ""facing a blatant violation of our sovereignty and human rights through the brutal practices of the Israeli enemy"". He added he hoped he could leave the UN session with a ""serious solution"" to ""put pressure on Israel to achieve an immediate ceasefire on all fronts"". Asked by Reuters if a ceasefire can be reached soon, he responded: ""Hopefully, yes."" Also speaking earlier, Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said it was grateful for diplomatic efforts to avoid escalation but would ""use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our aims"". He said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war"", and has made its desire for peace ""clear"". Mr Danon added that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu will arrive in New York on Thursday, have bilateral meetings later that day and speak at the General Assembly the following morning. More than 600 people have been reported killed across Lebanon since Monday, when Israel began an intense air campaign to destroy what it said was infrastructure built up by Hezbollah since they last fought a war in 2006. Another 90,000 people in Lebanon have been newly displaced, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes before the escalation, according to the UN. Almost 40,000 are living in shelters across the country. Nearly a year of deadly cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza has also displaced around 70,000 people in northern Israel, whose safe return the Israeli government and military say they want to ensure. Hezbollah says it is attacking Israel in support of its Palestinian ally, Hamas, and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Cross-border fighting continued on Wednesday, with Hezbollah saying it had targeted the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency with a missile fired towards Tel Aviv - the first time Hezbollah has targeted the heavily populated area. It was intercepted by air defences and there were no reports of damage or casualties. Hezbollah also fired dozens more rockets into northern Israel, injuring two. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters that the strikes had killed at least 51 people and injured 223, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. It comes after an unprecedented wave of attacks on Hezbollah. Last week, 39 people were killed and thousands were wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members to communicate exploded in two waves across Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for the attacks. Then, an Israeli air strike on Friday on the group’s stronghold of Dahieh, in southern Beirut, essentially wiped out the chain of command of its main fighting unit, the Radwan Force. The group confirmed that one of its top military leaders, Ibrahim Aqil, was among 55 people killed."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30305l5jqpo,"Israeli kibbutz struggles to heal, one year after 7 October","A year since scores of people were killed here, the collective is splintered - psychologically and physically.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:53.540740,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A few metres from a charred home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Simon King tends to a patch of ground in the sunshine. The streets around him are eerily quiet, the silence punctuated only by the sound of air strikes that ring in the near distance. In this community almost a year ago, 101 people were killed after gunmen from Hamas and other groups rampaged through Be'eri's tree-lined streets, burning homes and shooting people indiscriminately. Another 30 residents and their family members were taken to Gaza as hostages. Survivors hid in safe rooms all day and long into the night - exchanging horrifying details with each other over community WhatsApp groups, as they tried to make sense of what was happening. The kibbutz was a strong community, where people lived and operated together as one. Neighbours were more like extended family. It is one of a small number of kibbutzim in Israel that still operates as a collective. But now, post-7 October, the collective is splintered - psychologically and physically. About one in 10 were killed. Only a few of the survivors have returned to their homes. Some travel back to the kibbutz daily to work, but can't face overnight stays. Many, after months in a hotel, are now living in prefabricated buildings on another kibbutz 40km (25 miles) away. The community, built up over nearly 80 years, is being tested like never before, and its future is uncertain. There are reminders everywhere of those who didn't survive - says Dafna Gerstner, who grew up in Be'eri, and spent 19 terrifying hours on 7 October holed up in a safe room - designed to protect residents from rocket attacks. ""You look to the left and it's like, 'Oh it's my friend who lost her parents.' You look to the right, 'It's my friend who lost her father,' [and then] 'She lost her mother.' It's everywhere you look."" Inside Be'eri, surrounded by a high fence topped with barbed wire, you are never far from a house completely burnt or destroyed, or an empty patch of land where a home, wrecked that day, has been demolished. Some streets might, upon first glance, appear almost untouched - but look closely and even there you will see markings spray-painted on walls by military units on or after 7 October. Houses where people were killed or kidnapped have black banners on the facades with their names and photos. In the carcass of one burnt-out home, a board game rests on top of a coffee table, next to a melted television remote control. Food, long-rotten, is still in the fridge-freezer and the smell of burning lingers. ""Time stood still in the house,"" says Dafna, 40, as she pokes through the ash-covered wreckage. She and her family had been playing that board game on the eve of the attacks. Here, her disabled father and his Filipina carer hid for hours in their fortified safe room, as their home burned down around them. Dafna says it is a miracle they both survived. Her brother did not. A member of Be'eri's emergency response squad, he was killed in a gunfight at the kibbutz's dental clinic. Dafna was staying in his house at the time, on a visit from her home in Germany. Dozens of buildings in Be'eri are spattered with bullet holes - including the nursery. The play park and petting zoo are empty. No children have moved back, and the animals have been sent to new homes. The kibbutz's empty streets sometimes come alive, though, in a surprising way - with organised tours for visitors, who give donations. Israeli soldiers, and some civilians from Israel and abroad, come to see the broken homes, and hear accounts of the devastation, in order to understand what happened. Two of those who volunteer to lead the tours, Rami Gold and Simon King, say they are determined to ensure what happened here is remembered. Simon, 60, admits this can be a difficult process. ""There's a lot of mixed feelings and [the visitors] don't really know what to ask but they can see and hear and smell… it's a very heavy emotional experience."" Rami, 70, says these occasions are often followed by restless nights. Each tour, he says, takes him back to 7 October.  He is one of the few who moved back to Be'eri after the attacks. And the tours are not popular with everyone. ""At some point it felt like someone took over the kibbutz - everybody was there,"" Dafna says. But Simon says the stories have to be told. ""Some don't like it because it's their home and you don’t want people rummaging around,"" he says. ""But you have to send the message out, otherwise it will be forgotten."" At the same time, both he and Rami say they are looking to the future, describing themselves as ""irresponsible optimists"". They continue to water the lawns and fix fences, amid the destruction, as others build new homes that will replace those destroyed. Simon describes the rebuilding as therapy. Established in 1946, Be’eri is one of 11 Jewish communities in this region set up before the creation of the state of Israel. It was known for its left-leaning views, and many of its residents believed in, and advocated for, peace with the Palestinians. After the attacks, many residents were moved into a hotel by the Dead Sea - the David Hotel - some 90 minutes' drive away. In the aftermath of the attacks, I witnessed their trauma. Shell-shocked residents gathered in the lobby and other communal areas, as they tried to make sense of what had happened, and who they had lost, in hushed conversations. Some children clung to their parents as they spoke. Still now, they say, the conversations have not moved on. ""Every person I speak to from Be'eri - it always goes back to this day. Every conversation is going back to dealing with it and the effects after it. We are always talking about it again and again and again,"" says Shir Guttentag. Like her friend Dafna, Shir was holed up that day in her safe room, attempting to reassure terrified neighbours on the WhatsApp group as Hamas gunmen stormed through the kibbutz, shooting residents and setting homes on fire. Shir twice dismantled the barricade of furniture she had made against her front door to let neighbours in to hide. She told her children, ""it's OK, it's going to be OK"" as they waited to be rescued. When they were eventually escorted to safety, she looked down at the ground, not wanting to see the remains of her community. In the coming months at the Dead Sea hotel, Shir says she struggled as people began to leave - some to homes elsewhere in the country or to stay with families, others seeking to escape their memories by heading abroad. Each departure was like ""another break-up, another goodbye"", she says. It is no longer unusual to see someone who is crying or looking sad among Be'eri's grieving residents. ""In normal days it would have been like, 'What happened? Are you OK?' Nowadays everyone can cry and no-one asks him why,” Shir says. Shir and her daughters, along with hundreds of other Be'eri survivors, have now moved to new, identical prefabricated homes, paid for by the Israeli government, on an expanse of barren land at another kibbutz, Hatzerim - about 40-minutes drive from Be'eri. I was there on moving day. It feels a world away from the manicured lawns of Be'eri, though grass has now been planted around the neighbourhood. When single mother Shir led her daughters, aged nine and six, into their new bungalow, she told me her stomach was turning from excitement and nerves. She checked the door to the safe room, where her children will sleep every night, noting that it felt heavier than the door at Be'eri. ""I don't know if it's bulletproof. I hope so,"" she said. She chose not to bring many items from Be'eri because she wants to keep her home there as it was - and to remind herself that she will one day return. The mass move to Hatzerim happened after it was put to a community vote - as is the case with all major kibbutz decisions. It is estimated about 70% of Be'eri's survivors will live there for the time being. About half of the kibbutz's residents have moved in so far, but more homes are on the way. The journey from Hatzerim to Be'eri is shorter than it was from the hotel - and many people make the trip every day, to work in one of the kibbutz's businesses, as they did before. Shir travels to Be'eri to work at its veterinary clinic, but can't imagine returning to live there yet. ""I don't know what needs to happen, but something drastic, so I can feel safe again."" In the middle of the day, the Be'eri lunch hall fills with people as they gather to eat together. Shir, like many others, has reluctantly applied for a gun licence, never wanting to be caught off-guard again. ""It's for my daughters and myself because, on the day, I didn’t have anything,"" she says. Her mother's long-term partner was killed that day. When they talk about it, her mother says: ""They destroyed us."" Residents say they have relied on the support of their neighbours over the past year, but individual trauma has also tested a community that has historically operated as a collective. The slogan at Be'eri is adapted from Karl Marx: ""Everyone gives as much as he can and everyone gets as much as he needs."" But these words have now become hard to live by. Many residents of working age are employed by Be'eri's successful printing house, and other smaller kibbutz businesses. Profits are pooled and people receive housing and other amenities based on their individual circumstances. However, the decision of some people not to return to work has undermined this principle of communal labour and living. And if some residents decide they can never return to Be'eri that could, in turn, create fresh problems. Many have little experience of non-communal living and would struggle financially if they lived independently. The 7 October attack has also quietened calls for peace. The kibbutz used to have a fund to support Gazans. Some residents would also help arrange medical treatment for Gazans at Israeli hospitals, members say. Now, among some, strong views to the contrary are shared in person and on social media. ""They'll [Gazans] never accept our being here. It's either us or them,"" says Rami. Several people bring up the killing of resident Vivian Silver - one of Israel's best-known peace advocates. ""For now, people are very mad,"" Shir says. ""People still want to live in peace, but for now, I can't see any partner on the other side. ""I don't like to think in terms of hate and anger, it's not who I am, but I can't disconnect from what happened that day."" Shir wears a necklace engraved with a portrait of her lifelong friend Carmel Gat, who was taken hostage from Be'eri that day. Her biggest dream was that they would be reunited - but, on 1 September, Carmel's body was found alongside five other hostages. The IDF said they had been killed by Hamas just hours before a planned rescue attempt. Hamas said the hostages were killed in air strikes - but an autopsy on the returned bodies concluded they had all been shot multiple times at close range. Be'eri is still waiting and hoping for the return of others. So far, 18 have been brought back alive, along with two dead bodies, while 10 are still in Gaza, at least three of whom are believed to still be alive. Behind Dafna's father's house, 37-year-old Yuval Haran stands in front of the home where his father was killed, and many relatives were taken hostage, on 7 October. His brother-in-law Tal is still being held in Gaza. ""Until he comes back, my clock is still on 7 October. I don't want revenge, I just want my family back, I just want to have a quiet peaceful life again,"" Yuval says. In all, some 1,200 people were killed across southern Israel on 7 October, with 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. Since then, in the Israeli military operation in Gaza, more than 41,000 people have been killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hundreds of people - combatants and civilians - have also been killed in Lebanon in Israeli air strikes against the armed group Hezbollah, in a significant escalation of their long-running conflict. Residents from Be'eri say that before 7 October, despite their proximity to the Gaza fence, they always felt safe - such was their faith in the Israeli military system. But that faith has now been shaken. ""I'm less confident and I'm less trusting,"" Shir says. She relives the events in her dreams. ""I wake up and I remind myself it's over. But the trauma is, I think, for life. I don't know if I can ever feel fully safe again."" This summer Rami and Simon also took on the sombre task of digging graves for Be'eri's dead, who are only just being moved back to the kibbutz from cemeteries elsewhere in Israel. ""After the 7th [October] this area was a military zone, we couldn't bury them here,"" says Rami, as he looks over the graves, a rifle slung across his body. Simon says it brings up strong and passionate feelings - ""but in the end they're back at home"". Each time a person is returned, the kibbutz holds a second funeral, with many residents in attendance. Shir, in the temporary site at Hatzerim, says that for now, she is drawing strength from the community around her. ""We're not whole, but we will be I hope,"" she says. ""It's a grieving community - sadder and angrier - but still a strong community."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9k5l19njo,"How could Israel respond, and what might Iran do then?","Israel is set to retaliate for Iran's missile attack, while Tehran says it will hit back in turn if this happens.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:53.628758,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Middle East is once again on the brink of a deep and damaging war between two protagonists that have been facing off against each other for much of the past 45 years. This is now one of the most dangerous moments for the entire region. Iran, which became an Islamic Republic after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, has long vowed to destroy the state of Israel, which it calls the ""Zionist regime"". Israel accuses Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) of spreading violence across the Middle East through its allies and proxies, a view shared by several Arab governments. Israel is poised to retaliate against Iran for Tuesday’s volley of ballistic missiles, some of which penetrated Israel’s air defences. Iran says that was in response to two assassinations by Israel - of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. So what happens next? Both Israel and its closest ally, the US, have vowed to punish Iran for launching 180 missiles at Israel. ""Iran,"" says Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, ""will pay a heavy price.""  The restraint that Israel’s allies urged on it the last time there was a standoff like this in April is more muted this time. And given Israel’s determination to take on all its enemies at once - in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and Syria - the Netanyahu government seems to be in no mood to hold back. Israeli planners will likely now be debating not if and when to hit Iran, but how hard.  Aided by US satellite intelligence and by Mossad (Israel’s overseas spy agency) human agents on the ground in Iran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has a wide range of targets to choose from. These can broadly be divided into three categories: A large part of their calculations will involve trying to second guess Iran’s response in turn and how to mitigate it. The Iranian position is that after launching those missiles at what it says were Israeli military targets on Tuesday the score is now settled. But it is warning that if Israel retaliates it will hit back in turn. ""This is only a glimpse of our capabilities,"" said Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian. The IRGC reinforced this message, stating: ""If the Zionist regime responds to Iran’s operations, it will face crushing attacks."" Iran cannot defeat Israel militarily. Its air force is old and decrepit, its air defences are porous and it has had to contend with years of Western sanctions.  But it still has an enormous quantity of ballistic and other missiles as well as explosive-laden drones and numerous allied proxy militias around the Middle East. Its next volley of missiles could well target Israeli residential areas, rather than military bases. The attack by an Iran-backed militia on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in 2019 showed just how vulnerable its neighbours are to attack. The IRGC Navy, which operates in the Gulf, has large flotillas of small, fast missile attack boats which could, potentially, overwhelm the defences of a US Navy 5th Fleet warship in a swarm attack. If it had orders to do so, it could attempt to sow mines in the Strait of Hormuz, interrupting the flow of up to 20% of the world’s daily oil exports, something that would have a major impact on the global economy. And then there are all the US military bases, dotted up and down the Arabian side of the Gulf, from Kuwait to Oman. Iran has given warning that if it is attacked it won’t just hit back at Israel, it will target any country it perceives as supporting that attack. These then, are just some of the scenarios that defence planners in Tel Aviv and Washington will now be considering."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kdg7jwvz7o,Bowen: Israel believes it has weakened Hezbollah but escalation still carries risks,Israel's allies and critics believe the way to cool this crisis is to get a ceasefire in Gaza - but no agreement is in sight.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:53.706902,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Monday was the bloodiest day in Lebanon since Hezbollah’s 2006 war with Israel. Israel launched a massive series of air strikes this morning that have so far killed 492 people according to the Lebanese government and the Israelis are warning of more attacks to come. The war is escalating fast, a process that is being driven by the scale of Israel’s air offensive. They are warning civilians to leave the areas they’re targeting. The next, they’ve said, will be the Bekaa Valley in the north-east of Lebanon which is a Hezbollah stronghold. Even before the current escalation, well over 100,000 Lebanese had to leave their homes because of Israeli strikes, with no immediate expectation of being able to return. We are seeing yet another very large escalation by the Israelis. Perhaps their calculation is that they believe Hezbollah is in such a weakened position right now that this is their opportunity to really inflict some damage on it, and to change the strategic picture in the hills and towns on either side of the border between Israel and Lebanon. While the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict has been going on for decades, the current war between them started the day after the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year. Hezbollah started a limited but continuous campaign of rocket fire over the border, trying to tie down Israeli troops and damage Israeli property and people. Around 60,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate to the centre of the country. In the last few days, returning them to their homes has been added to Israel’s list of war aims. The US and UK, and other allies – and critics – of Israel believe that the only hope of cooling this dangerous crisis is to get a ceasefire in Gaza. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has said attacks on Israel will go on until a Gaza ceasefire happens. But it seems pretty clear at this point that neither the leader of Hamas nor the leader of Israel is prepared to go for the deal the US has put on the table. The war itself has overwhelming support from Israelis, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains unpopular with significant parts of Israel’s electorate, despite an improvement in his poll ratings. Many Israelis also think Netanyahu is an appalling leader who tells lies and has abandoned the hostages in Gaza. So he is a very controversial character, but bolstered in the parliament by the right wingers who support him, he is politically secure. His decision to go on the offensive is risky. While Hezbollah is wounded, it has plenty of capacity to hit back. And that is why Israel’s friends and enemies are still preparing for the worst."

The Pentagon said it used aircraft and warships to launch the attacks in order ""to protect freedom of navigation"". Several explosions were reported in some of Yemen’s main cities, including the capital Sanaa. Since November, the Houthis have launched attacks on around 100 ships in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels. The rebel group says the attacks are retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Central Command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, said the attacks targeted weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Houthis. Houthi-aligned media say the Yemeni capital of Sanaa was among cities hit.  On Monday, the Houthis said they had shot down a US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen. The US military acknowledged losing an unmanned aircraft. Last week the Pentagon said the Houthis had launched ""a complex attack"" on US Navy ships in the region, though all of the weapons launched were shot down. Sanaa has had a respite from bombing in the past two years since fighting between the warring parties in Yemen largely subsided. As well as the attacks on ships in the Red Sea, the Houthis have fired several missiles and drones at Israel directly. In July a drone launched from Yemen struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and injuring 10. Last month, the group fired several missiles at Israel, including one that targeted Israel's main airport. Both times Israel responded by attacking sites in Yemen. Earlier this year, the US, UK and 12 other nations launched Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect Red Sea shipping lanes against the Houthis. The Houthis are part of a network of armed groups in the Middle East backed by Iran that includes Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0g2ge1k81o,"Israel attacks on UN in breach of international law, Harris says",Taoiseach Simon Harris has described Israel’s attack on peacekeepers a breach of international law.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:27:53.894120,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris has described Israel’s attack on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon as a breach of international law. Speaking to BBC News in Washington DC, Harris said it was an ""extraordinarily concerning development"". The IDF has acknowledged that its troops ""opened fire in the area"" of the base in Naqoura on Thursday after instructing UN troops to ""remain in protected spaces"". Ireland has 379 troops in Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission. None were hurt in recent attacks, but two Indonesian soldiers were injured on Thursday. Two other peacekeepers were injured in a separate explosion on Friday which the IDF has said it is investigating. The taoiseach described attacks on three United Nations Interim Force positions in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as ""really dangerous, despicable attacks on peacekeepers"". He added that the IDF had positioned themselves at a UNIFIL outpost which was being manned by about 30 Irish peacekeepers, but had since moved following UN and US intervention. The taoiseach said that he was protesting ""at the highest levels"" in relation to the attack, and said that the United Nations, and all of the countries making up the peacekeeping mission should ""speak with one voice"" about what he called Israel's breach of international law. However, he said he was concerned that ""Israel doesn't listen"". Harris added that Israel had ""a right to defend itself, a right to live in peace and security"" and that no-one disputed that but that “international law has to be followed, and proportionality also has to be due”. He said neither of those tests were currently being met. He said he had spoken to the US President Joe Biden twice in recent days, including at an hour-long meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday.  He said he had also spoken to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres about the matter. On Friday UNIFIL reported that two more peacekeeping troops had been hurt in two explosions near the Naqoura base. The IDF said Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon had identified a threat and responded with fire. The Israeli military said it had struck the UNIFIL post, which was about 50m away from the source of the threat. It said it had earlier told UNIFIL troops to stay in a protected space and added that it was continuing to examine the incident. The UK government has said it is “appalled” by reports that Israel deliberately fired on the base. US President Joe Biden has asked Israel not to hit UN peacekeepers while carrying out operations against Hezbollah, and France, Italy and Spain released a joint statement, saying attacks on peacekeepers are ""unjustifiable and should immediately come to an end"". In an evening update, the Irish Defence Forces confirmed all personnel ""are well and accounted for"". Israel has requested that the UNIFIL peacekeepers withdraw from southern Lebanon, but the taoiseach rejected that.  He said: “We cannot have a situation where aggression can force a peacekeeping mission to leave.""  Harris said the IDF and Hezbollah needed to “respect the role of our peacekeepers” and what was needed was an “urgent de-escalation” and a ceasefire. Irish Defence Forces Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Seán Clancy described attacks on UN peacekeepers as an ""egregious violation"". He said the Israeli military needs to be held accountable as their actions were ""reckless"" and cannot be tolerated. Lt Gen Clancy told Irish broadcaster RTÉ that he did not believe the Israeli claim that the strikes were inadvertent. ""From a military perspective this is not an accidental act. It is a direct act,"" he said. ""Whether its indiscipline or directed, either way it is not conscionable or allowable."" On Friday evening, the head of UN Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix said there is reason to believe some of Israel's firing at peacekeepers in Lebanon was direct. “We have reason to believe that in some cases the firing has been direct,"" he told BBC's Newshour programme. ""For example we have a case where a tower was hit by a fire and also damages to cameras at one of the positions – which obviously to us very much looked like direct fire."" Lacroix added that parties involved in the conflict had obligations to respect peacekeepers safety. ""There is a risk for more of this incident, and it is highly important to keep conveying these messages... the idea to all parties that peacekeepers need to be respected."" On Harris's earlier remarks, Mr Lacroix told BBC News: ""Certainly the firing against peacekeepers position is in violation of international obligation. That is absolutely clear."" He added that although the peacekeepers are in ""difficult and dangerous conditions"", they have made a ""considerate decision"" to remain situated in position and fulfill their mandates. Israel alleges that that the UN has failed to enforce the 1701 resolution which called for a demilitarised zone and the disarmament of Hezbollah and this was partly to blame for the current conflict. For its part, UNIFIL has said Israel's ground invasion of southern Lebanon constitutes a violation of resolution 1701. Harris said: “It’s very hard to take a lecture from Israel in terms of holding UN resolution right now, or indeed international law, when we’ve seen completely disproportionate war and the impact that that has had from the humanitarian crisis point of view of civilians, including children."" The taoiseach said there were “significant lessons” that could be learned from the Northern Ireland peace process, and the first was to “never allow the world to believe that a terrorist organisation is the same as a country”. Ireland is one of several European countries that has recognised the state of Palestine.  The taoiseach said it took that decision because “we know Palestine is not Hamas"". He said: ""Hamas is a despicable, disgusting terrorist organisation that should be condemned outright by all right thinking people, but we know what it's like in Ireland to have efforts to hijack and sabotage your national identity and your flag by terrorists, and we can never stand for that."""

Dozens of people attended the service, which was held in Bonn Square on Sunday night. It happened on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, which saw gunmen storm into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. The event saw residents gather, along with faith and community leaders. It was organised by the Oxfordshire Civic, Community and Faith Leaders’ Group, and  led by the Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft and imam Monawar Hussain.  Representatives from all faiths were invited to pray and reflect on conflicts around the world, with a focus on those living in Gaza and Israel. The attack on Israel by Hamas marked the beginning of a year of war affecting the Middle East. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has seen at least 41,000 people killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Held in an effort to promote unity, the vigil aimed to stand against ""all forms of hatred, racism and division"". Mr Hussain said it was ""lovely"" that so many people had attended the event. ""It gives us a chance to stand together for peace, to talk to each other, to create understanding,"" he said. ""And symbolism also, it's really important for people to see how we all come together, different faiths, no faith - but we're together.""

Thousands of families have also fled their homes as the Israeli military said it hit 1,600 Hezbollah targets in an operation to destroy infrastructure that the armed group had built up since the 2006 war. Hezbollah, meanwhile, launched more than 200 rockets into northern Israel, according to the military. Paramedics said two people were injured by shrapnel. World powers have been urging restraint as both sides appear to be spiralling closer towards all-out war. Lebanon's health ministry said 35 children and 58 women were among the dead, while 1,645 others had been wounded. It did not report how many of the casualties were civilians or combatants. Health Minister Firass Abiad said thousands of families had also been displaced by the strikes. UN Secretary General António Guterres expressed alarm at the escalating situation and said he did not want Lebanon to “become another Gaza”. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the ""escalation is extremely dangerous and worrying"" ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the UN in New York, adding ""we are almost in a full-fledged war"". President Joe Biden said the US was “working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely”, while the Pentagon announced it was sending “a small number” of additional troops to the Middle East ""out of an abundance of caution"". Nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the war in Gaza has killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. The Pentagon said it was sending “a small number” of additional US troops to the Middle East amid the growing crisis. ""In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,"" said Pentagon spokesman Maj Gen Pat Ryder in a briefing with reporters. He would not answer any follow-up questions on the specifics. Early on Tuesday, the IDF said it had detected 20 launches from Lebanon overnight ""in the valleys area"", adding some were intercepted by air defense fighters and others fell in open areas.  ""Air Force aircraft attacked the sources of the fire,"" it added on X. Lebanese media said the first wave of Israeli air strikes began at around 06:30 local time (03:30 GMT) on Monday. “It was horrifying, the missiles flew over our heads. We woke up to the sound of bombings, we didn’t expect this,” one woman said. Dozens of towns, villages and open areas were targeted throughout the day in the districts of Sidon, Marjayoun, Nabatieh, Bint Jbeil, Tyre, Jezzine and Zahrani in southern Lebanon, as well as the Zahle, Baalbek and Hermel districts in the eastern Bekaa Valley, according to the state-run National News Agency (NNA). In the evening, it reported that a building in the Bir al-Abed area of the southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut, was hit by several missiles. Lebanese security sources said the strike targeted Hezbollah’s top commander in southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, but that it was not clear whether he was killed. Hezbollah’s media office said Karaki was “fine” and had “moved to a safe place”. From the south to Beirut, roads were congested as people desperately tried to leave amid the bombardment and after receiving audio and text messages from the Israeli military warning them to move away immediately from buildings where Hezbollah was storing weapons. A family of four riding on a motorbike spoke to the BBC in Beirut during a brief stop on their way to the northern city of Tripoli. ""What do you want us to say? We just had to flee,"" the father said anxiously. Information Minister Ziad Makary said his ministry had received an Israeli phone call urging it to evacuate its building in Beirut. However, he insisted that it would not comply with what he called “a psychological war”. Prime Minister Najib Mikati, meanwhile, told a cabinet meeting: “The continued Israeli aggression on Lebanon is a war of extermination in every sense of the word.” “We are working as a government to stop this new Israeli war and to avoid descending into the unknown,” he added. On Monday night Israel said it killed a ""large number"" of Hezbollah militants when it hit about 1,600 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon. “Essentially, we are targeting combat infrastructure that Hezbollah has been building for the past 20 years. This is very significant,” the IDF’s Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, told commanders in Tel Aviv. “Ultimately, everything is focused on creating the conditions to return the residents of the north to their homes.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said videos from southern Lebanon showed ""significant secondary explosions caused by Hezbollah’s weapons that were being stored inside the buildings"". ""It is likely that some of the casualties are from these secondary explosions,"" he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the people of Lebanon to “get out of harm's way now”. “For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage,” he said. “To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out these weapons.” A senior Israeli military official insisted that the IDF was “currently focusing on Israel’s aerial campaign only” after being asked by reporters if a ground invasion of southern Lebanon was imminent to create a buffer zone. The official said Israel had three aims - to degrade Hezbollah's ability to fire rockets and missiles over the Lebanon-Israel border, to push its fighters back from the frontier, and to destroy the infrastructure built by Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force which could be used to attack Israeli communities. Hezbollah did not comment on the Israeli claims that it had hidden weapons in houses, and its media office had announced the death of only one fighter by Monday evening. But in a sign that it is unlikely to back down, it said it had responded to the “Israeli enemy’s attacks” by firing barrages of rockets at several Israeli military bases in northern Israel, as well as a weapons manufacturing facility in the coastal Zvulun area, north of the city of Haifa. The IDF said 210 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon by the evening, and that an unspecified number had landed in the Lower Galilee and Upper Galilee regions, in Haifa and the nearby areas of Carmel, HaAmakim and Hamifratz areas, and in the occupied Golan Heights. One house was badly damaged by a rocket in Givat Avni, in the Lower Galilee. Resident David Yitzhak told the BBC that he, his wife and six-year-old daughter were unharmed because they had managed to get behind the solid door of the house's safe room seconds earlier, when a warning siren sounded. “It’s a metre from life to death,” he said. Israel’s ambulance service said it treated two people with shrapnel wounds in the Lower and Upper Galilee regions, and that another person was injured as they rushed to a shelter. Early on Tuesday, the IDF said it had detected 20 launches from Lebanon overnight ""in the valleys area"", adding some were intercepted by air defense fighters and others fell in open areas.  ""Air Force aircraft attacked the sources of the fire,"" it added on X. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched more than 150 rockets and drones across the border, while Israeli jets struck hundreds of targets across southern Lebanon. Hezbollah remains a powerful force, despite being weakened by what Israel’s defence minister described as “the most difficult week” for the group since its establishment. On Tuesday and Wednesday, 39 people were killed and thousands were wounded after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded. And on Friday, Hezbollah said at least 16 members, including top commanders of its elite Radwan Force, were among 45 people killed in an Israeli air strike in southern Beirut. Speaking at a funeral on Sunday, Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said the group would not be deterred. ""We have entered a new phase,” he said, “the title of which is the open-ended battle of reckoning."" On the streets of Beirut, one young man told the BBC that he was ""very scared of the war escalating"" because it would “ cause a lot of disaster, it will stop students going to university"". But another man was defiant, saying: ""We're not scared, we have to stand tall, we have to defend ourselves."""

Israel has been bombing the area through the day, with more than 30 air strikes in just an hour. Forty-six people are confirmed dead - and that toll is expected to rise. Others are in critical condition in hospital, after Israeli attacks earlier this week. Noor Mossawi is among them. The six-year-old is lying unconscious in a paediatric intensive care unit, in Rayak Hospital, with bandages wrapped around her fractured skull.  Her mother Rima is sitting by her bedside, holding a copy of the Quran and praying. She tells us her daughter is very bright and very sociable.  ""She creates such a fun atmosphere at home. The house feels empty when she's not around. She loves meeting new people."" All that changed last Monday, with an Israeli strike. She shows us another video of her daughter - this time praying, shortly before the attack.  ""I was soothing her, telling her not to be afraid, that nothing would happen. She was calling on God and the prophets for help,"" Rima says. As the bombing was getting closer, Rima was hunkering by her front door with Noor and her twin brother Mohammed.   ""We weren’t brave enough to go inside,"" she says, ""because we thought the building would collapse on us if it was hit.   ""When it got more intense, I picked up Noor and her brother and was about to take them in, but the missile was much faster than I was."" That missile left Mohammed lightly wounded, and Noor fighting for her life.  As we speak, suddenly there is danger overhead. We hear a plane, and then an explosion which rattles the windows and knocks out the power for a few seconds.  It’s another air strike. Rima barely reacts. Noor’s father Abdallah comes to visit, and is burning with rage. ""Please film my child,"" he says. ""She doesn't know what weapons are. She doesn't know how to fight. She was playing at home when the bombing started. They [Israel] wanted to terrorise the people and get them to flee."" Israel says its strikes are targeting Hezbollah sites, including weapons stores and ammunition dumps.   Abdallah begs to differ. ""We have nothing to do with weapons. I am not involved with the resistance [Hezbollah]. But now I wish I was so that I could protect my children,"" he tells us. Minutes later, a few floors down, sirens wail as an ambulance brings in wounded from the latest strike.  Medical staff are rushing back and forward.  The emergency department fills with tension. There are angry shouts, and shocked friends and relatives. We are asked to stop filming. The hospital has admitted 400 casualties of Israeli strikes since Monday - all civilians - according to Dr Basil Abdallah, the medical director.  Of those, more than 100 have died, and several families had lost more than one person. Dr Abdallah tells us there is trauma among the staff, as well as the patients. ""Seeing children bombed, seeing elderly patients and women bombed, it's difficult,"" he says. ""Most of the nurses and the doctors are depressed. We have emotions. We are human."" Most of the staff remain at the hospital around the clock as it is too dangerous to risk the journey home. Israel is striking far and wide in Lebanon. There’s no-one to stop it.  For now, Hezbollah is putting up a limited fight, firing rockets across the border.  Its backer, Iran, is remaining on the sidelines. Dr Abdallah is already worried about running out of drugs and essential supplies.  He fears this will be a long war."

Speaking to the UN Security Council, António Guterres said it was high time to stop what he called the ""deadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence"" in the Middle East.  In an earlier statement, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared Guterres persona non grata and an ""anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists"". The comments were issued in response to Guterres initially calling for a ceasefire, but not specifically mentioning the Iran attack.  Addressing the council, the UN secretary general said he had condemned the attack in April, and ""as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed, I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel"".  ""These attacks paradoxically do not seem to support the cause of the Palestinian people, or reduce their suffering,"" he said.  He also criticised Israel's actions in the region, calling the military campaign in Gaza ""the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years as secretary general"". On Tuesday, Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles into Israel, with Israel saying most of them were intercepted.  In a statement after the attack on social media site X, formerly Twitter, Guterres said he condemned ""the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation"".  Prior to Guterres remarks to the UN Security Council, Katz said in a statement that anyone who ""cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil"".  He specifically criticised Guterres for ""his anti-Israel policy since the beginning of the war"". Tuesday's attack by Iran is the latest in a series of escalations, starting almost a year ago with attacks on Israel by Hamas, and recently involving increased fighting between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.  Since the attack, a military campaign in Gaza has now killed a total of 41,689 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Over the course of the conflict, there have been a number of clashes between Israel and the United Nations about the situation in Gaza and the West Bank.   There has also been friction between Israel and the UN over the role of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. In January, Israel alleged that a number of the agency's staff members had been involved in the 7 October attacks.  In response to this, the agency launched an investigation - with a number of its international funders withdrawing support for it, before later reinstating it. In August, nine staff members were dismissed over potential involvement in the attacks.  During the conflict, UNRWA has criticised Israel for air strikes in Gaza which have killed its staff members.

Tens of thousands walked from Russell Square to Whitehall, where speeches took place outside Downing Street. The event was organised by groups including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, with people travelling from around the country to take part.  Seventeen people were arrested, the Metropolitan Police said.  The largely peaceful protest comes one year after the 7 October attacks in Israel. The Metropolitan Police said it was hard to accurately estimate turnout but the protest ""appears to be greater than other recent protests"".  The crowd stretched from Downing Street to Trafalgar Square while speakers, including ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, were addressing demonstrators. People could be seen carrying Palestinian flags and placards with messages such as ""ceasefire now"" and ""hands off Lebanon"", and chanting ""stop the bombing now"".   A counter-protest also took place, with police forming a cordon between the two marches. But a small group broke away from the pro-Palestinian protest and were stopped trying to approach the counter-protest at Aldwych. Three people were arrested after officers intervened.  Conditions were imposed to move the counter-protest group back to Trafalgar Square as it got ""too close to the main march and well away from the agreed area"", police said.  Of the 17 arrests, police said three people had been arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, three for assault, eight for public order offences (four racially aggravated), one for a breach of Public Order Act conditions and two for supporting a proscribed organisation. The force said one of those arrested for supporting a proscribed organisation was seen wearing what appeared to be a parachute. It added it was aware of social media posts showing people holding placards with messages of support for Hezbollah - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK government and others - and it was working to find those involved.  Separately, pro-Palestinian supporters walked through the centre of Edinburgh during a silent march on Saturday afternoon.  Organisers called for a ceasefire and for the UK and Scottish governments to impose sanctions on Israel.  On Sunday, a memorial event will take place in Hyde Park organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. The war began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has now killed at least 41,825 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Additional reporting by Darin Graham "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylgv2dk3yo,Iran faces dilemma of restraint or revenge for attacks on ally Hezbollah,Iran has sought to strike an unusually conciliatory tone in the face of attacks on its ally Hezbollah.,26 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:02.066888,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Many hardline conservatives in Iran are growing uneasy about its lack of action as Israel targets the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, their country’s closest and most long-standing ally. When President Masoud Pezeshkian addressed the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, he criticised Israel’s war in Gaza and warned that its attacks on Lebanon could not go unanswered. But Mr Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, adopted a more conciliatory tone than his hard-line predecessors, avoiding rhetoric about annihilating the Islamic Republic’s arch-enemy. “We seek peace for all and have no intention of conflict with any country,” he stated. He also expressed his government's readiness to resume nuclear talks with Western powers, saying: “We are ready to engage with participants of the 2015 nuclear deal.” Other senior Iranian officials and commanders of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) have also appeared to be unusually restrained when expressing their intentions to take revenge on Israel for its actions against their country and its key allies Hamas and Hezbollah. Iran has armed, funded and trained both armed groups, but Tehran's leaders rely on Hezbollah to be a major deterrent preventing direct attacks on their country by Israel. Iranian support has been critical to Hezbollah’s transformation into Lebanon’s most powerful armed force and political actor since the IRGC helped found the group in the 1980s. It is the main supplier of the weapons that Hezbollah can deploy against Israel, particularly advanced missiles and drones, and the US has previously alleged that it also provides as much as $700m in funds annually. Last week, Mojtaba Amani, Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, was severely injured when his pager exploded last week at the embassy in Beirut. Thousands more pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members also blew up in two attacks that killed a total of 39 people. Iran blamed Israel, but it made no immediate public threats of retaliation. In contrast, when Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus in April, killing eight high-ranking IRGC Quds Force commanders, Iran swiftly responded by launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. Iran also vowed to retaliate after blaming Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July, although it has not announced that it has taken any action yet. A former IRGC commander told the BBC that repeatedly threatening Israel without following through was further damaging the force’s credibility among its supporters inside Iran and its proxies abroad. On Monday, President Pezeshkian told members of the US media in New York that Israel was seeking to draw Iran into a war. “Iran is ready to defuse tensions with Israel and lay down arms if Israel does the same,” he insisted. Some hardline conservatives close to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised the president for talking about defusing tensions with Israel, asserting that he should recognize his position and avoid giving live interviews. Mr Pezeshkian was due to hold a press conference in New York on Wednesday, but it was cancelled. It was unclear if he was forced to cancel because of his comments. In Iran, power lies in the hands of Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC. They are the ones making the key strategic decisions, not the president. It is notable that Ayatollah Khamenei also did not mention any plans for retaliation or issue threats toward Israel, which is quite unusual for him, when he addressed veterans on Wednesday. Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist at the US news site Axios, reported on Tuesday that two Israeli officials and Western diplomats had indicated that Hezbollah was urging Iran to come to its aid by attacking Israel. The Israeli officials claimed that Iran had told Hezbollah that “the timing isn’t right”, according to Ravid. Last week, the host of the Iranian internet TV program Maydan, which is known to have ties to the IRGC, cited Iranian intelligence sources as claiming that Israel had also “carried out a special operation last month, killing IRGC members and stealing documents”. He asserted that the Iranian press had been forbidden from reporting on the incident, which allegedly happened inside in Iran, and that the authorities were attempting to control the narrative. In response, Tasnim News Agency, which also linked to the IRGC, denied the allegations. The Islamic Republic finds itself in a precarious situation. It is concerned that attacking Israel could provoke a US military response, dragging the country into a broader conflict. With a crippled economy due to US sanctions and ongoing domestic unrest, a potential US strike against the IRGC could further weaken its the regime’s security apparatus, possibly emboldening the Iranian opponents to rise up once more. However, if Iran refrains from direct intervening in Hezbollah’s conflict with Israel, it risks sending a signal to other allied militias in the region that, in times of crisis, the Islamic Republic may prioritize its own survival and interests over theirs. This could weaken Iran’s influence and alliances across the region."

The paper says the White House fears that ultimately US forces could be drawn in, if the Israelis target Iran's nuclear facilities. The Sun urges Britain and America not to be ""squeamish"" and back Israel all the way if, in its words, ""Tel Aviv opts to cut the head off the snake"". The Daily Mirror favours persevering with diplomacy until, it says, ""every avenue has been exhausted"". Gideon Rachman in the Financial Times observes that US President Joe Biden's efforts to prevent a war in the Middle East are failing. He says that each time Israel has defied his calls for restraint, Washington has still come to its aid and, with the presidential election weeks away, this support is unlikely to weaken. Analysis in the Daily Mail suggests targeting Iran's nuclear centre might be the most dangerous option for Israel as Tehran could respond with dirty bombs - missiles tipped with nuclear waste. Equally bombing Iran's oil export facility could lead to a retaliatory attack on Saudi Arabia, hitting global supplies and undermining international support. There is a suggestion in the I paper that Israel might hit Iran's military bases or even its leadership. Experts raise concerns in the Daily Telegraph that UK forces lack the equipment to help protect Israel. The Conservatives' former Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace tells the paper the upgrade of systems on some of the Royal Navy's anti-missile destroyers needs to be accelerated. The Daily Express reports that security chiefs fear the crisis could lead to terror attacks in the UK. The security services and the Met are said to be on ""red alert"". A Jewish charity, the Community Security Trust, is mounting its biggest security operation before the anniversary of the 7 October attack by Hamas. The Daily Mail suggests Sir Keir Starmer was ""humiliated"" into paying back what it calls his £6,000 worth of ""freebies"". The Times points out he is keeping more than £40,000 worth of clothes, glasses and football tickets accepted in his time at Number 10. And the Sun calculates the repayment is just 5% of the £107,000 in gifts, benefits and hospitality Sir Keir has received since 2019. Several front pages show the first picture of the Princess of Wales at work since completing her chemotherapy. She is shown embracing a teenager with cancer, in what the Sun describes as ""Kate's hug of love"". Sixteen-year-old photographer Liz Hatton, who has a terminal diagnosis, was fulfilling a bucket list, according to the Mail when she was invited to take pictures at an investiture in Windsor Castle. The I reports on research revealing how dolphins smile at one another to show they are ready to play. The author of the study at the University of Pisa explains that open-mouthed expressions and mimicry are often used by mammals and social carnivores to signal fun and avoid conflict. And the Times says there is relief for the editor of Private Eye, Ian Hislop, after fears he was the target of an assassin. The police were called because of fears a gunshot had been fired into his black cab. A Metropolitan Police investigation ensued and revealed a mechanical fault had caused the back window to shatter.

And it is not eager for more. It still bears the scars of 15 years of civil war between 1975 and 1990, and of the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.  But for some, including Beirut's Governor Marwan Abboud, Israel’s recent escalation already feels worse. In the past 10 days, the country has endured mass casualties from exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, a wave of assassinations of Hezbollah military commanders, devastating air strikes - and the use of bunker-busting bombs in Beirut, which killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. ""It’s the worst moment that the country passed through,"" said Abboud, who has no connection with Hezbollah.    ""I feel sad. I am shocked by the large number of civilian casualties. I am also shocked by the silence of the international community - as if what’s happening here does not mean anything."" We spoke at the edge of Beirut’s Martyrs Square, where many families slept in the open last night after fleeing Israel’s strikes in the southern suburb of Dahieh -  Hezbollah's heartland. They remain in the square today - unsure where to turn for safety, like many in Lebanon. Asked what he thought Israel’s plan was, the governor replied: ""I don't know but Israel wants to kill and to kill and to kill. May god protect this country."" His parting words were bleak. ""It’s the saddest day of my life,"" he said, his voice heavy with emotion. A few steps away we met an extended family, sitting on bare concrete, under the harsh morning sun. Madina Mustafa Ali was rocking her seven-month-old baby Amir in her lap and reliving the trauma of Friday night. ""There was an explosion, and we got scared, especially for the children. So we ran away and came here. This is where we slept,"" she said. She told me the family will stay in the square for now because they have nowhere else to go. Others are fleeing, some heading to the north of Lebanon. The south of the country is not an option - it's being hit hard. Driving through the city we saw families on the move, some crammed into cars with thin mattresses strapped to the roof, others piled onto motorbikes.   Here and there, we saw people on foot carrying a few belongings.  This is the new landscape of Beirut: boarded-up shops, fewer people, and more fear - especially since Nasrallah’s killing was confirmed. Throughout the day, plumes of dark smoke billowed from Dahieh. The Hezbollah stronghold looked much weakened today - the two busiest streets were largely deserted, and many apartment blocks looked empty.   We spotted Hezbollah members, guarding an air strike location, one brandishing a Kalashnikov. That's a sign of tension, or desperation - as normally the armed group doesn't show its weapons on the streets. Hezbollah was not watching our every move today - they were more focused perhaps on the threat from above. We, too, were keeping an eye on the skies, where there were drones. At the location of one Israeli strike, we saw smoke still rising from the ruins of what appeared to be a factory. We were told it made kitchen roll, and there was plenty of that shredded on the ground. Lebanon has been rendered a war zone, but there are risks growing for the entire Middle East. And plenty of questions. Will Hezbollah hit back hard at Israel? Can it? Will its Iranian backers intervene? Until now they have been in no rush. And will Tehran's other regional proxies - in Iraq, Syria and Yemen - get more involved? Three days of national mourning are due to begin in Lebanon on Monday. No-one can be sure what else is ahead."

The Middle East is on the brink, it argues, with US officials ""locked in talks"" with Israel about what happens next. It reports that President Joe Biden is tying to salvage his ceasefire proposal for Israel and Hezbollah. The Financial Times says the US is sending an ""additional few thousand troops"" and fighter jets to the region to protect the 40,000 US service peronnel already there and help Israel defend itself. The Daily Telegraph homes in on the Israeli prime minister's warning to Iran that it is heading towards the ""abyss"". The paper reports that Benjamin Netanyahu gave a speech - in English - directed at citizens in Iran, in which he said the Islamic Republic's ""puppets"" were being eliminated by the day. ""There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach,"" the Telegraph quotes him as saying. The paper says his words were a ""possible prelude"" to a war with Iran itself. The Times says it has been told that migrants will continue to be housed in hotels for up to three years because the asylum backlog will take much longer to clear than Labour thought. Ending the use of hotels was one of Sir Keir Starmer's election pledges, though the party gave no time frame. According to the paper, Home Office officials had been expecting to stop using the last hotel within a year. But Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is said to have conceded privately it would take longer to clear the backlog. The Telegraph notes that her predecessor James Cleverley told a fringe event at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham that it was a mistake to use the phrase ""stop the boats"" about tackling migrant crossings. The Tory leadership contender said its use distilled a complicated problem into a soundbite. According to the Guardian, the prime minister has been urged to do more to help with rising gas and electricity costs this winter as average energy bills go up today by almost £150 a year. The Resolution Foundation think tank said its research suggested around 7.7 million households would struggle to heat their homes, in the wake of the winter fuel payment cuts for most pensioners in England and Wales. Many of the papers cover the BBC's verdict on the Strictly Come Dancing bullying claims. The corporation cleared Giovanni Pernice of using physical aggression towards his partner Amanda Abbington but he was found to have used belittling language. The Express highlights the ""vindication"" for Abbington, noting the BBC apologised to her over bullying complaints against Pernice. The Daily Mirror says both sides claimed victory, while the Sun's front page features a single speech bubble over the former dance partners, with both saying, ""I've won"". And the Guardian and Times both report Mount Everest is having a ""growth spurt"" and becoming taller. Scientists says it is partly down to ""isostatic rebound"", where extreme erosion of surrounding areas allows the mountain to be pushed upwards, by as much as half a millimetre a year.

Nadia Ayoub McCulloch, 51, and her children Thomas, 19, and Rebecca, 16, attempted to fly out from Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport to Birmingham due to the ongoing conflict with Israel which has seen the city bombed.  However, Ms McCulloch was turned away by officials as she does not have a UK passport or visa, meaning only her children were allowed to leave. Her Scottish husband of 20 years, William McCulloch, 62, now intends to travel back to Lebanon from Iraq in the hope he can reunite with his wife and leave the country together. He said: ""I just don't understand it. We paid for the three seats, she went to the airport, and she was told that she can't get on the flight because she didn't have a visa. ""Rebecca organised everything and she may have been told before she left the house (that Ms McCulloch would be unable to board the flight), but she thought she would just go and try because she wanted to go with the kids, but she was told categorically, no.""  As of last month, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals including dependants, in Lebanon. More than 250 UK citizens have already left on chartered flights. As of Friday morning, more than 2,000 British nationals had registered their presence in the country, the Foreign Office said. The UK government is chartering another flight for Britons to leave on Sunday, the fourth such flight organised since the escalation of the conflict in Lebanon.  The Foreign Office said it did not normally comment on individual cases.   The general advice is that spouses of British nationals are eligible to leave on the specially chartered flights but if they are not UK citizens, they must have a valid visa to stay in the UK for more than six months.  A government spokesman said: ""We understand this is a worrying time for many. The safety of British nationals in Lebanon is our top priority and we urge everyone to continue to follow our travel advice. ""All non-British nationals requiring a visa will need to make an online visa application and submit their biometrics at a Visa Application Centre, prior to travel to the UK."" Mr McCulloch, who has lived in Lebanon since 2002, said the couple were evacuated with Thomas during the 2006 Lebanon war and had ""no problem whatsoever"" on that occasion. Mr McCulloch works with humanitarian organisation Norwegian People's Aid and is currently working to clear unexploded ordnance in Iraq. He will fly back to Beirut later in October, despite the continuing conflict. He added: ""I have no problems going back into Beirut - if something happens, something happens, but 100% I'm going back to my wife.""  His son David Hardie, 36, who lives in Carluke, said it was a ""a lot of weight"" off his shoulders to have his siblings back in Scotland. He said: ""Even when they announced the flight, there was nothing about a ceasefire or how they were going to get to the airport or anything... that was scary for them, because you don't know when the next bomb is going to hit"". Mr Hardie said he was ""angry"" over the visa situation. He added: ""They've been married for over 20 years - it's not like they've been married for two or three years, they've been married 20 years, and she can't even get evacuated from a war."" Mr Hardie also criticised the cost of the UK government flights out of Lebanon, which were £350 per person. He said the cost was a ""low blow"". Mr Hardie added: ""We're not poor or anything but I still feel like, if you've been evacuated from a war-torn country, there should have been more help. ""I think that was a surprise. Like, you get a text message, you click a link, you go in, you sign your name, your passport number, and then at the end, it asks you for £350. ""There might have been families over there who couldn't afford that."" The last week has seen a significant escalation of the crisis in the Middle East, with warning that it could develop into a all-out regional war.  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel."

The decision was taken by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet late on Monday. About 60,000 people have been evacuated from northern Israel because of near-daily attacks by Iran-backed Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. Cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - a day after the deadly attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. ""The Security Cabinet has updated the objectives of the war to include the following: Returning the residents of the north securely to their homes,"" a statement from the prime minister's office said. ""Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,"" it added. Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the only way to return Israel's northern residents to their homes was through ""military action"", during a meeting with US envoy Amos Hochstein. “The possibility for an agreement is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas, and refuses to end the conflict,” a statement from his office said. ""Therefore, the only way left to ensure the return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes, will be via military action.” Gallant's comments came as speculation grew that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to replace him amid differences between the two men over the war in Gaza. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned of the devastating consequences of further escalation. In a statement from the US defence department, his office said he ""reaffirmed the necessity of a ceasefire and hostage deal, and that Israel should give diplomatic negotiations time to succeed, noting the devastating consequences that escalation would have on the people of Israel, Lebanon, and the broader region."" Israel has repeatedly warned it could launch a military operation to drive Hezbollah away from the border. Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organisation which is politically influential and in control of the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. The group has so far made no public comments on the issue. The latest Israeli move marks an expansion of the country's previously stated war goals:  Israeli forces launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,220 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is sending 700 troops to nearby Cyprus to prepare for the possible evacuation of British nationals from Lebanon and the government ""continues to advise against all travel to Lebanon"". Britons have been advised to book flights out of the country - but there are limited options available, with most airlines except the national carrier having cancelled flights and ceased operating and reports that those remaining are full. The situation in the country, where Israeli strikes reportedly killed more than 560 people this week, is described as deteriorating ""rapidly, with devastating consequences"". Lebanon’s health minister has told the BBC what is happening in his country is “carnage”, as hospitals struggle to cope with the number of casualties from two days of widespread Israeli air strikes targeting Hezbollah. Asked by reporters how the British prime minister would ensure the situation wasn’t a repeat of the chaos in the Afghan capital Kabul when the Taliban seized control in August 2021, Sir Keir said: ""The most important message from me to British nationals in Lebanon is to leave immediately. ""It is important that we’ve been really, really clear: now is the time to leave.” The handling of the Afghan evacuation, where 15,000 people were airlifted out of the country, was widely criticised as mismanaged and chaotic. An estimated 10,000 UK citizens are currently in Lebanon. A senior government source said that the difference, for now at least, was that there were still commercial flights leaving Lebanon and British nationals should book a seat. US citizens have also been told to leave the country. The US Embassy in Lebanon said that most airlines had suspended or cancelled flights with many flights sold out, and urged people to book any ticket available.  Almost every airline operating in Lebanon has stopped flying in and out of the country except for the national airline, Middle East Airlines (MEA). Alistair, a British national who is married to a Lebanese woman and living in Beirut, said that day-to-day life was mainly carrying on as normal. Asked about the intensification of the conflict, he told BBC's PM programme: ""It's a different level isn't it?"" He urged diplomats to ""get a deal made so the violence ceases"" and to ""bring peace because the ordinary folks here are just recipients of whatever is dealt out"". The 700 British troops deployed to Cyprus will join 500 military personnel who were sent there over the summer as part of the MoD's contingency plans for an evacuation operation. Two British warships are already in the region and Royal Air Force planes and helicopters on standby. Asked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he sensed the world was on the brink of all-out war in the Middle East, Sir Keir said he was “deeply concerned”. He said he “put it in those terms, that we are potentially at a brink point, and we have to come back from the brink”. He repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation, along with other ministers. Defence Secretary John Healey said: “We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. ""Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British nationals should the situation deteriorate. ""I want to thank the British personnel who are deploying in the region for their commitment and professionalism.” Healey held a meeting with fellow ministers, intelligence chiefs and diplomats on Tuesday afternoon to work through the government’s plans. Officials say the UK already has a significant diplomatic and military presence close to Lebanon, including RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and two Royal Navy ships - RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan - which have been in the eastern Mediterranean over the summer. The Royal Air Force also has planes and helicopters on standby. The escalating conflict in the Middle East is likely to be a significant topic of discussion for the prime minister and other world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York. Sir Keir arrived in the city on Tuesday evening local time. Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. The Israel military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas attack has killed more than 41,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Previously sporadic fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October - the day after Hamas's unprecedented attack. Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with Hamas. Hezbollah has launched more than 8,000 rockets at northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It has also fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. Last week Hezbollah’s communication devices started exploding all across Lebanon. Israel then launched a massive series of air strikes on Monday that have so far killed 560 people according to the Lebanese government. Last year, the British government helped co-ordinate the evacuation of British nationals from Gaza, with some 200 UK citizens thought to be living in the territory before the war broke out.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dvpj2y1m7o,Families of Gaza hostages call on UK government to 'do more',Hostage families call on the government to table a UK plan to get their relatives released.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:10.015904,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The families of hostages held in Gaza say they feel let down and have called on the government to do more to free their relatives. They held a news conference in London, along with the relatives of other British-Israelis murdered on 7 October, following a memorial event at Downing Street. Earlier, they met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Lawyers for the hostages said the families had received a message of support from the King and Queen. A statement issued by the Foreign Office said: “Their Majesties have asked us to convey that they continue to keep you and all hostage families in their special thoughts and offer their prayers for your strength and endurance during such a dreadfully difficult and agonising time for you.” One of the relatives, Steve Brisley, said it felt like the “cold-blooded brutal murders” of his family - “all three who were British citizens” - have been forgotten.  His British sister Lianne and UK-Israeli nieces Noiya and Yahel Sharabi were murdered on 7 October. His brother-in-law Eli is still a hostage. “It was an act of terrorism” he said.  “It is 51 weeks since my family was torn apart, 51 weeks since Eli was taken... I call on my government to do better, to do more, to bring them home.” At Monday's news conference, along with the other hostage families, he called on the UK government to table their own UK plan to get their relatives released - and on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a deal to free the hostages. The relatives also expressed concern that if Israel launched a limited ground incursion into Lebanon it would take away the focus from trying to free the hostages. They said it was time for the UK government to take a more “hands-on approach” on working to free their family members who are still being held in Gaza. Ayelet Svatitzky’s British-Israeli brothers, Nadav and Roi Popplewell, were killed.  She said a month ago she had ""stood in front of my brothers’ graves and said my final goodbye"".  Nadav was taken hostage, forced to record a video while held and his body was recovered from Gaza in August.  ""My mum who just turned 80 lost both her sons. She is dealing with that trauma and the trauma of being kidnapped from her home.  ""I am here pleading to everyone not to forget what happened on 7 October, not to forget the 101 hostages.” Sharone Lifschitz is British-Israeli. Her father, 84-year-old Oded, is still being held. Her mother Yocheved was released last October. Ms Lifschitz said the families had had a fruitful meeting with the prime minister.  “I think the British government can and should do more... we are still in the 7th of October [and] we are fighting for their lives.  ""I don’t know if my father is dead or alive… we want the British government to see the hostages with British links as their problem.” Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. At least 41,615 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rd5z17px4o,Israel orders 45-day closure of Al Jazeera West Bank office,"The network, which Israel has called a threat to its security, broadcast the operation live.",22 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:10.201426,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Israeli military has raided the offices of news broadcaster Al Jazeera in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, confiscated its equipment and ordered it to close for an initial period of 45 days. Armed Israeli soldiers entered the building early on Sunday during a live broadcast. Israel's military said a legal opinion and intelligence assessment determined that the offices were being used ""to incite terror"" and ""support terrorist activities"", and that the channel's broadcasts endanger Israel's security. Al Jazeera ""vehemently"" condemned the closure and ""unfounded allegations presented by Israeli authorities to justify these illegal raids"", and called the move an ""affront"" to press freedom. The Foreign Press Association said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the development, which it also said threatened press freedom. ""Restricting foreign reporters and closing news channels signals a shift away from democratic values,"" the organisation said. Viewers watched as the troops handed the closure order to Al Jazeera’s West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari, who read it out live on air. “Targeting journalists this way always aims to erase the truth and prevent people from hearing the truth,” Mr al-Omari said in comments reported by his employer. The soldiers confiscated the last microphone and camera off the street outside and forced Mr al-Omari out of the office, Al Jazeera journalist Mohammad Alsaafin said. Posting about the raid on social media, Mr Alsaafin said the troops also pulled down a poster of Shireen Abu Aqla - an Al Jazeera reporter who was killed while covering a raid by Israeli forces in the West Bank. The network and witnesses at the time said the Palestinian-American reporter was shot by Israeli forces. Israel initially argued she had been shot by a Palestinian. However, months later it concluded there was a ""high probability"" that one of its soldiers killed her. About the closure of the offices, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it and Israel Border Police, alongside the civil administration, enforced an order signed by the Commander of the Central Command. The offices had been sealed and equipment confiscated, the IDF added. Al Jazeera decried the ""draconian actions"" and ""oppressive measures"", but said it would not deter the network from covering Gaza and the West Bank. The news outlet said it would pursue all available legal channels through international legal institutions to protect its rights and journalists, as well as the public's right to information. Relations between the Qatari-owned broadcaster and the Israeli government have long been tense, but have worsened following the outbreak of war in Gaza. With foreign journalists banned from entering the strip, Al Jazeera staff based in the area have been some of the only reporters able to cover the war on the ground. In April, the Israeli parliament passed a law giving the government power to temporarily close foreign broadcasters considered a threat to national security during the war. A ban would be in place for a period of 45 days at a time, as seen in Sunday's raid, and can be renewed.  In early May, the Al Jazeera offices in Nazareth and occupied East Jerusalem were subject to separate raids."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdn8y89jeo,"Israeli arrested over Iran plot to kill Netanyahu, Israeli security services say","They say the man was twice smuggled into Iran and had been paid to carry out ""missions"".",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:16.570790,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Israeli citizen has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in a plot by Iran to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, Israel's security services say. Israeli police and domestic intelligence said the man was twice smuggled into Iran and received payment to carry out missions. In a joint statement, they said the suspect was a businessman who had lived in Turkey and had Turkish contacts who had helped get him into Iran. The announcement comes at a time of soaring tension between Iran and Israel, regional arch-enemies.  The statement said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested last month. It said his targets were the prime minister, the defence minister and the head of Israel's internal security agency Shin Bet. It said that in April and May, the suspect twice travelled to Samandag in Turkey to meet a wealthy Iranian businessman called Eddie, and was helped by two Turkish citizens. The statement said Eddie had problems leaving Iran on both occasions, so the Israeli citizen was smuggled from Turkey into Iran instead. It said that the man met both Eddie and ""an Iranian security operative"" there. It said Eddie asked the Israeli to ""carry out various security missions within Israel for the Iranian regime"".  According to the statement, these included transferring money or a gun, photographing crowded places in Israel and sending them to ""Iranian elements"", and threatening other Israeli citizens who had been recruited by Iran but had not completed their tasks. At the second rendezvous in Iran, Iranian intelligence agents are said to have asked the Israeli to carry out terrorist activities in Israel, including the assassination of Netanyahu, defence minister Yoav Gallant, or Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. According to the investigation, it was also suggested assassinating former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and other public figures, in revenge for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July 2024. Iran blamed Israel for that attack, which Israel neither confirmed nor denied involvement in. Investigators say the Israeli demanded an advance payment of $1m. The group are also alleged to have discussed killing opponents of the Iranian regime in Europe and the US, and recruiting a Mossad operative to become a ""double agent"".  The Israeli is alleged to have been paid 5,000 euros ($5,600; £4,200) for the meetings.  A senior Shin Bet official said the case ""exemplifies the enormous efforts of Iranian intelligence agents to recruit Israeli citizens to promote terrorist activities in Israel"".  Iran and Israel have been major foes since the Islamic revolution brought the current regime to power in Iran in 1979.  Iran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and is a major backer of Israeli adversaries including Hamas and Hezbollah. Hostilities between Iran and Israel have intensified with the war in Gaza, and both sides have carried out direct or indirect attacks on each other in recent months."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gd393llg7o,Israel and Hezbollah urged to step back as UN warns of 'catastrophe',"Israel says it will continue military action, as the UN chief raises the risk of Lebanon becoming ""another Gaza"".",23 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:16.669321,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel and Hezbollah both threatened to increase their cross-border attacks on Sunday, despite international appeals for them to step back from all-out war. Israel’s military said about 150 rockets, missiles and other projectiles were fired at its territory overnight on Saturday and early on Sunday – mostly from within Lebanon.  Some reached further than previous strikes, sending thousands of Israelis to bomb shelters and damaging homes near the city of Haifa. Israel launched its own strikes on targets in southern Lebanon, which it said destroyed thousands of Hezbollah's rocket launchers.  On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take ""whatever action is necessary to restore security"" and return people safely to their homes along the Israel-Lebanon border. He said Israel had dealt ""a series of blows on Hezbollah that it could have never imagined"". But the group's deputy leader Naim Qassem declared: “Threats will not stop us... We are ready to face all military possibilities"". Speaking at the funeral of Ibrahim Aqil, a high-ranking Hezbollah commander killed in Israel's Friday strike on Lebanon's capital, Beirut, he said: ""We have entered a new phase, namely an open reckoning"" with Israel. Sheikh Nadeem Qassem told mourners that Israel had failed in all its aims, while the resistance - meaning Hezbollah - had continued firing for the last three days. He said more Israeli residents would be pushed out from their homes in the north of the country, adding that Israel had failed to break the group's resistance and connection with Gaza. Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, which is also part of Iran’s so-called ""Axis of Resistance"". Huge crowds lined the streets and followed the coffin as it was driven on an elevated platform on the back of a pick-up truck. Among the grief and anger at the funeral, there was a message of defiance from the gathered Hezbollah supporters - including chants of ""death to America"" from the crowd. The ceremony took place in a square in the southern suburb of Dahieh in Beirut, the heartland of Hezbollah, just a few streets away from Friday's air strike. Lebanese officials said 45 people were killed in the attack, including Ibrahim Aqil and 15 of his men. Aqil had many enemies, and a bounty of $7m on his head. He was wanted by the US  for his alleged links to the killing of hundreds of Americans in Beirut in the 1980s – in attacks on the US Embassy and a Marine barracks. About 30 civilians were also killed in Friday’s Israeli strike, including entire families.  At the scene today, relatives remained at the edge of a vast crater, hoping for remains to be found. Lebanese Minister for Public Works Ali Hamie – who is linked with Hezbollah - said Israel is dragging the region to war. “At the end, Lebanon is not seeking the war,” he told the BBC at the scene of the strike.  “Even the Lebanese people. But Israel is calling us worldwide, come to war. Come to war.” Asked if he thought war would happen, he replied: ""I don’t know, we will see."" Hezbollah is the most powerful political and military organisation in Lebanon. The Shia Muslim organisation is better armed than many nations. It is classed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. Fighting between Hezbollah and Israel escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions. About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage in the Hamas attacks on southern Israel, while 60,000 people in the north have been evacuated as a result of near-daily rocket attacks by Hezbollah since.  The latest cross-border exchanges have sparked renewed international concern.  UN chief Antonio Guterres told CNN he feared ""the possibility of transforming Lebanon [into] another Gaza"".  The UN special co-ordinator in Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, posted on X that the Middle East was on the brink of ""imminent catastrophe"". ""It cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,"" she posted on Sunday. US President Joe Biden said Washington would do ""everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out"". The EU said it was ""extremely"" concerned, while UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for an ""immediate ceasefire"". The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said many of the projectiles it faced had been intercepted overnight on Saturday, including two that had been launched from Iraq.  The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a Iran-backed group, said it had fired cruise missile and explosive drone attacks at Israel. Northern Israel remains on high alert, with schools closed and hospitals moving patients underground. People there have been told to restrict outdoor gatherings to fewer than 10. One resident of Kiryat Bialik on the outskirts of Haifa, which was hit by rocket fire, told Reuters news agency: ""Around 06:30 there was an alarm and then immediately afterwards a big explosion - very, very big explosion - even three or four houses from here. Our window in the main room was completely destroyed."" Earlier this week, 39 people were killed and thousands wounded after pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, the politically-influential Iran-backed organisation, exploded on two days across Lebanon. On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah blamed Israel for the attacks, saying it had crossed ""all red lines"" and vowed ""just punishment"". Israel has not claimed responsibility. As fears increase that the conflict may break out into a full-scale war, the US state department issued new travel advice for citizens currently in Lebanon. The US embassy in Beirut urged people to ""depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available"". Neighbouring Jordan's foreign ministry issued similar advice to its citizens, urging those in Lebanon to leave as soon as possible.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl8xw7ww70o,'We just had to flee': Fear and tension in Lebanon under deadly Israeli bombardment,Thousands have fled southern Lebanon while others say they are leaving the capital Beirut.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:16.763860,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Across southern Lebanon, families scrambled together belongings and headed north in cars and trucks and on motorcycles as the Israeli military struck targets it said were linked to the Lebanese Shia armed group Hezbollah. Some residents reported receiving warnings in the form of text messages and voice recordings from the Israeli military to leave areas near the Iran-backed group’s positions. Zahra Sawli, a student in the southern town of Nabatieh told the BBC's Newshour programme the bombardment was intense. ""I woke up at 6am to the sound of bombing. By noon it started to get really intense and I saw a lot of strikes in my area."" ""I heard a lot of glass shattering."" Unlike many, she and those she was with did not leave the house - they didn't dare, she said. ""Where are we supposed to go? A lot of people are still stuck on the streets. A lot of my friends are still stuck in traffic because a lot of people are trying to flee,"" she said. By the middle of the day roads north towards Beirut were clogged with traffic, with vehicles heading towards the capital on both sides of a six-lane coastal highway. Other images showed people walking along the beach in the southern city of Tyre as smoke rose from air strikes in the countryside inland. The BBC spoke to one family of five who had arrived in Beirut on a single motorbike.  From a village in the south, they were heading to Tripoli in the north. They were exhausted. ""What do you want us to say? We just had to flee,"" the father said. By Monday evening the Lebanese health ministry reported that 492 people had been killed and more than 1,600 injured in the bombardment. It said at least 35 children were among those killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had carried out 1,100 strikes over the previous 24 hours. That included an air strike in southern Beirut that the IDF said had targeted a senior Hezbollah commander. In Beirut too there was widespread anxiety. As people from the south arrived in the capital in cars with suitcases strapped to the top, some of the city's residents were themselves leaving.  Israel has warned people to evacuate areas where it says Hezbollah is storing weapons - but it also sent recorded warnings to people in Beirut districts not considered Hezbollah strongholds including Hamra, an area home to government ministries, banks and universities. Parents rushed to pick up their children from school after receiving more warnings to leave the area. One father, Issa, took his son out of school, telling Reuters news agency: ""[We're here] because of the phone calls. ""They’re calling everyone and threatening people by phone. So we’re here to take my boy from school. The situation is not reassuring,"" he said. Mohammed, a Palestinian man on the road with his wife, spoke to the BBC on the way out of Beirut. When asked if he would stay in the capital he said: ""In Lebanon nowhere is safe, Israel is saying they are going to bombard everywhere. Now they threatened this neighbourhood, so where should we go?"" ""It’s scary, I don’t know what to do - work, go home, no idea what to do."" Meanwhile as a BBC crew set up on one side of the road, a taxi driver called out asking if they knew of a fuel crisis unfolding. “Too many people are coming to Beirut,” he said. Schools have been hastily converted into shelters for the streams of evacuees coming from the south. On a government order, schools in Beirut and Tripoli as well as eastern Lebanon were established as shelters. The BBC was at a classroom at a public school in Bir Hasan, west Beirut on Monday which was being prepared for people coming from the Bekaa Valley - a Hezbollah stronghold in north-eastern Lebanon which Israel said it was targeting too. The classrooms were stacked with mattresses but would be fully occupied by the end of the day, workers said. Meanwhile Lebanon’s hospitals were also ordered to cancel all elective surgeries on Monday as physicians braced for a wave of casualties and injuries.  Despite the tense and uncertain atmosphere in Beirut, some people were defiant. ""If a total war happens, we should stand as Lebanese people together regardless of our political affiliations because at the end of the day, our country is getting bombed,"" one man told the BBC. Others were simply resigned to the violence. ""If they want war, what can we do? It was imposed on us. We cannot do anything,"" shop owner Mohammed Sibai told Reuters. Mohammed, a 57-year-old in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieyh - Hezbollah's main power base in the capital - told the BBC he had ""survived all the wars since 1975"" so ""it's normal for me"". ""I will not leave, I will be in my house,"" he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y8gv1d8j8o,"One week on, how the Lebanon attacks have changed the Middle East",David Aaronovitch asks why the operation was carried out - and what we can expect in the weeks ahead.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:16.841079,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The war in Gaza always had the capacity to spread. Near-daily rocket attacks in and around northern Israel by Hezbollah, Hamas's Lebanese allies, and air strikes by Israel have displaced tens of thousands of civilians on either side of the border. But until recently, the smart money was on both Israel and Hezbollah avoiding full escalation. That money isn't looking so smart today. Last week's extraordinary targeting of thousands of Hezbollah operatives through their pagers and walkie-talkies seems to have altered the calculus. Israel is believed to have been behind this attack - so why might it have carried out this operation, and why last week? What does it say about how modern wars are conducted? And what can we expect to happen in the weeks to come - how likely is a ground war between Israel and Hezbollah? First of all, it’s important to understand exactly what Hezbollah is and where it comes from. The group came into existence in the early 1980s after Israel occupied southern Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war. At first Hezbollah presented itself as a resistance group against Israel and the voice of Lebanon’s Shia community, says Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East Institute at SOAS University of London. The Briefing Room: Lebanon attacks How do the attacks alter the equation in the Middle East? David Aaronovitch and guests discuss the recent events in Lebanon. Listen now on BBC Sounds But when Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah kept its weapons in violation of a UN resolution requiring it to disarm. It continued to present itself as a necessary force for the defence of Lebanon and “became the country's most powerful political actor”, says Prof Khatib. Although it is represented in Lebanon’s government, Hezbollah’s real power lies behind the scenes, she adds - as an armed group that many analysts say is more powerful than the Lebanese army, it has the ability to intimidate its opponents. “It is able to set the foreign policy agenda for Lebanon to a large extent, as well as declare war, basically, on behalf of Lebanon,” says Prof Khatib. Hezbollah is also aligned with Iran - the group’s “principal armourer”, according to Shashank Joshi, The Economist's defence editor. “There isn't simply a sort of immediate direct command, but they are very, very closely tied in aims and in practices.” The rubric that we're supposed to use when we discuss these attacks is that Israel is believed to have carried them out because Israel has not confirmed that it did so - a long-standing policy on the part of Israeli officials. When operations take place in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, “they tend to put their hands up but they don’t when it’s Lebanon or Iran”, says Ronen Bergman, an Israeli investigative journalist with the New York Times. However, the attacks are widely cited as having been carried out by Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service. Unlike other such agencies around the world, Mossad’s role is not just restricted to intelligence gathering, according to Bergman. Mossad also sees it as its duty to “translate the intelligence it collects into what they call kinetic or aggressive or physical operations”, he says, including “explosives, sabotage, targeted killings”. A week has now passed since the pager attacks. And the day after, the walkie-talkies were targeted too. So what do we know about these attacks? According to Joshi, it looks to have been a supply-chain attack in which Mossad set up front companies that look to have manufactured real pagers for some time. And when it came to this consignment bound for Hezbollah, it seems that Mossad placed explosives inside the devices that they were then subsequently able to remotely trigger. In 2018, Bergman says, a young intelligence officer found out that Hezbollah had started using pagers and came up with the idea of Mossad infiltrating their supply chain. Some 4,500 booby-trapped devices were then supplied to Hezbollah, Bergman adds. There are some accounts that suggest Mossad knew where these pagers were and who was in possession of them before detonating them. However, Joshi is sceptical of these claims. He says, too, that “this was not some magical cyber-attack in which the batteries spontaneously combusted by some clever bit of code as people may initially have thought or suspected”. CCTV footage of the pagers going off were broadcast around the world. The images were shocking - and they also tell us a great deal about Hezbollah's organisation and structure, says Prof Khatib. Typically, the group operates with a high degree of secrecy, she says: “Not all its members are known, sometimes even to their own families.” What the attacks have done, then, is expose who paid members of Hezbollah actually were. That information, she says, has already proved useful to Israel. In one case, “one of the people who ended up in hospital was later visited by someone, and that person as a visitor was later tracked by Israel, leading them to find out where the leaders of Hezbollah were meeting on the Friday that came after the attack”, Prof Khatib adds. Those commanders were later targeted by an Israeli strike, she adds. To some the attacks will have looked like a new type of warfare. Joshi, however, is not so sure. “It’s always been possible if you wanted to put explosives inside a phone, a pager, inside a banana, if you feel like it. The point is to what end?” He says the Americans had contemplated carrying out similar attacks in the past, but had shied away because of the potential implications.  After all, everybody now knows that Israel is capable of such an operation and can therefore take steps to prevent another one in future - taking apart devices and checking them for explosives, for instance. As a result, he says, “my suggestion is that we're not going to see many attacks like this”. The implication is that this was a one-off, use-it-or-lose-it situation - once you've carried out an operation like this, you can't do so again. For this reason, Bergman says there are divisions within Israel’s hierarchy about whether this was the right time to do it. “The timing of the attack is interesting,” says Bergman. “There are a lot of people in the defence establishment who are furious because they said this button was not supposed to be pushed here and now.” All this raises the question of what Israel was thinking. Previously, many had thought that Israel was avoiding full-blown conflict with Hezbollah and didn't want war on two fronts while it was fighting in Gaza. The attacks might indicate that this calculation has changed. But Bergman says it remains the case that most of the Israel Defence Force’s generals, including its chief of staff, oppose a ground invasion of Lebanon - conscious from their experience during the occupation in the 1980s and 90s that it could be a “death trap”. He suggests that the aim was to force Hezbollah’s secretary general Hassan Nasrallah to agree to a ceasefire without Israel ending the war in Gaza. Nasrallah has promised that he will not end his solidarity with Hamas until Israel ends its war in Gaza, says Bergman, while “Prime Minister Netanyahu, for his coalition integrity, doesn't want to end the war with Hamas”. The calculation, then, was that the pager and walkie-talkie attacks would shift the balance, allowing the IDF to focus on Gaza. “Of course, the risk of this is that it will lead to the other way - it will lead, instead of a ceasefire and a political solution, to an all-out war,” says Bergman. Prof Khatib says it would be “completely foolish” of Israel to attempt a ground invasion of southern Lebanon - Hezbollah is well-prepared, with long experience of ground warfare. But Joshi says it remains a risk. Recent air strikes against Hezbollah arms depots as well as the attacks themselves on the group’s leadership are “all the kinds of things you would need to be doing ahead of a major ground campaign inside Lebanon”. That brings us to the question of whether Hezbollah's capacity has been so degraded in recent weeks and its confidence so undermined that actually it isn't in a position to fight an all-out war. Joshi says that Hezbollah has taken a “battering”, having seen much of its leadership wiped out. “However, I think it would be a grave mistake to think it doesn't have considerable missile power at its disposal.” The thousands of Hezbollah rockets aimed at Tel Aviv and Haifa and other Israeli towns and cities represent a major reason why Israel might not want to engage in an all-out war, as do the thousands of residents of northern Israel who have already been evacuated from their homes because of the cross-border fighting. “The people who have remained are the people who probably don't have the means to flee,” says Prof Khatib. “But certainly things don't seem to be calming down anytime soon.”  Top Image: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

All day on Saturday, rescuers searched through the rubble after a high-rise building collapsed and others were partially destroyed in the attack.  Excavators were brought in to help clear the debris as medical staff surveyed the scene and people waited for news of those who were still missing. The attack, which hit the densely populated neighbourhood of Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut, killed at least 37 people, including three children, and wounded 68 others, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The airstrike was Israel's third on the Lebanese capital this year and has been seen as a major escalation in the region that has added to fears of an all-out war. A senior UN official, Rosemary Di Carlo, warned that the Middle East was at risk of a conflict that could ""dwarf"" the devastation witnessed in the region so far. Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia and political group, confirmed the death of Ibrahim Aqil, a senior commander in the group’s elite Radwan forces. The group also confirmed that Ahmed Wahbi, himself a top Radwan figure, died in the attack. Reacting to the attack, the Lebanese health minister, Dr Firass Abiad, said it was a “violation of international humanitarian law”. “The fact is that those children and those women who were killed were not members of Hezbollah,"" he said. ""Those were civilians that happened to be nearby”. Israel's military issued an update on Friday's strike in southern Lebanon, saying it had killed a dozen senior commanders in Hezbollah's elite Radwan force. In what it described as a ""precise strike"", the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said those targeted in Beirut had been meeting in Dahieh, a known stronghold of the Iran-backed group in the Lebanese capital. In a separate post on X, an IDF spokesperson added 12 of those killed in the Beirut strike were senior members of the Iran-backed group at the ""top of Hezbollah's leadership"". In addition to the death of Aqil, Hezbollah also confirmed that Ahmed Wahbi, himself a top Radwan figure, died in the attack that hit the densely populated Dahieh area - a stronghold of the group. How Hezbollah is going to respond isn't clear. It doesn't want to spark a wider war with Israel. Hezbollah's main supporter, Iran, does not want a major confrontation either. But the latest air strikes happened days after a wave of explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies used by the group killed dozens, wounded thousands more and caused panic in a country already exhausted by almost one year of conflict. From the device explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday, 152 people are still in a critical condition and 777 more being treated in hospital for their wounds, Dr Abiad said. The number of those killed over the two days of explosions has risen to 39.  Twelve people were killed in Tuesday's attack, while the number of those killed on Wednesday is up to 27, he added. On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah blamed Israel for attacks, saying it had crossed ""all red lines"" and vowed ""just punishment"".  Israel has not claimed responsibility. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said the pager and walkie-talkie explosions this week in Lebanon violated international humanitarian law. Cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then, hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in the cross-border fighting, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Israel recently added the return of people displaced from the north of the country to its list of war goals. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday Israel was entering a ""new phase of the war"", concentrating more of its efforts on the north."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw5yyjx75po,'Israel steps up attacks' and Badenoch 'sparks maternity pay row',Monday's front pages are dominated by reports of Israel's air strikes on Yemen and its offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:17.117392,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A number of the front pages focus on the fighting in the Middle East.  The Guardian warns of escalating violence after a wave of Israeli airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The paper says the attack on fuel and energy facilities, as well as ports, is one of the biggest operations in the nearly year long crisis in the region. The Financial Times has the headline ""Israel steps up attacks on Iran proxies"". The paper says alongside the strikes in Yemen, Israeli forces have inflicted a string of devastating blows on Hezbollah in Lebanon.  The i says Israel is targeting the Iranian weapons network in Yemen, after wiping out Hezbollah leaders, while The Times says Lebanon is bracing for battle as Israel appears to be planning for a ground invasion by massing tanks on the border. ""Badenoch sparks Tory splits over maternity pay costs"" is the Daily Telegraph's headline. The paper says rival Tory leadership candidates have turned on Kemi Badenoch, after she suggested that regulations around maternity pay had gone too far and were tying businesses in red tape. She has since said the comments were taken out of context.  Meanwhile, the Daily Mail leads with a claim by the former prime minister, Boris Johnson, that the French President Emmanuel Macron wanted Britain to suffer a ""punishment beating"" because of Brexit.  Elsewhere, the Financial Times says the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is hoping to attend a meeting of European Union finance ministers before the end of the year, as part of efforts to widen co-operation with the bloc. The paper says the arrangements are still being discussed, but that the Labour government seeks to ""widen co-operation with the bloc"". ""Emergency Money"" is the headline for the Daily Mirror, which claims an exclusive insight into the upcoming budget. The paper says Rachel Reeves will put the NHS at the heart of her plans next month. It says any spare money will be ploughed into saving hospitals by slashing waiting times. The Daily Express has the splash ""cruel winter fuel cuts will cost NHS £169m a year"". It quotes analysis by the campaign group, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, which says Labour's decision to limit winter fuel payments will leave 262,000 pensioners needing NHS treatment. And finally, the Daily Star cries ""invasion of the killer fungi"". It says dangerous Dead Man's Fingers and Death Cap mushrooms are ""booming"" across Britain because of the washout autumn. The paper says three people were poisoned and admitted to hospital after eating a death cap in Jersey last week. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04n1kg1d4o,Trump and Harris are deadlocked - could an October surprise change the game?,"With one month to go, any unexpected event could help sway this close race for the White House.",6 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:17.207321,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"With one month to election day, the contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is the electoral equivalent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The race for the White House still appears deadlocked, both nationally and in battleground states, so victory will be decided by the slimmest of margins - every new voter engaged, every undecided voter swayed, could help land a knock-out punch. “In any super close race, where the electorate is divided down the middle, a difference of a percentage point or two could be decisive,” says David Greenberg, a presidential historian at Rutgers University. While party strategists are focused on how to earn that decisive edge, it could just as easily be an event out of their control, an unexpected twist, that upends the campaign in the final weeks. It’s already been a year of political shockwaves - from one candidate surviving two assassination attempts and being convicted of a crime, to another, President Joe Biden, dropping out of the race in favour of his much younger vice-president. However, when the surprises drop in October - think Trump’s Access Hollywood tape or Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016 - there is scarcely time left to recover or regain momentum after a misstep or bad news cycle. This week alone, there were several new rumbles that could turn into political storms by 5 November. The first potential political storm was a literal one. Hurricane Helene tore through two key electoral battlegrounds last week, Georgia and North Carolina. Because of the intense focus on both states during this presidential race, a humanitarian disaster, with a death toll already over 200, has also become a political issue. Harris pledged long-term aid to the region at a stop in Georgia earlier this week, and visited those affected by the storm in North Carolina on Saturday. ""We're here for the long haul,"" she said in Georgia. Meanwhile, both states are essentially must-wins for Trump, and polls show a dead heat. While visiting Georgia, the former president claimed that Americans were losing out on emergency relief money because it had been spent on migrants. In fact, the two distinct programmes have separate budgets, and the Biden administration accused Republicans of spreading ""bold-faced lies"" about funding for the disaster response. When disaster strikes, it's not easy for the government to keep everyone happy. If Trump’s attacks land, any voter dissatisfaction with recovery efforts could potentially impact the result in two of the most closely-watched states in the country. Thousands of miles from the disaster-ravaged American southeast, a manmade crisis continues to inject itself into American politics. The Gaza war is in danger of expanding into a regional conflagration, as Israeli forces fought Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon and Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel earlier this week. While Harris has presented herself as a candidate of change, she put no distance between herself and the current administration when it comes to US-Israeli policies. That comes with risks. Hopes for any kind of pre-election ceasefire in Gaza appear firmly dashed, and the White House at this point is trying to ensure that the inevitable Israeli response to Tuesday’s Iranian strike doesn’t lead to all-out war. On Thursday night, Biden was not exactly reassuring. “I don’t believe there’s going to be an all-out war,” he said. “I think we can avoid it. But there’s a lot to do yet.” The war is also having consequences at home for Democrats, even if American voters usually don’t think directly about foreign policy when they cast their ballots. Harris’s commitment to continue supplying arms to Israel is a problem for two key segments of the Democratic base: Arab-Americans in the must-win state of Michigan, and young voters on campuses, where anti-war protests could start up again. The conflict in the Middle East has also fuelled pocketbook concerns. Biden’s mention of the possibility that Israel would target Iranian refineries caused the price of oil to jump more than 5% on Thursday. If there’s one thing that American consumers are particularly sensitive to, it's higher prices at the petrol pump. Across the board, public opinion surveys continue to show that the economy is the top issue for American voters. And Harris and the Democrats received some good news on that front on Friday, with the latest employment figures showing robust job growth over the past few months and an unemployment level that dropped to 4.1%. According to Mr Greenberg, however, voter concerns on the economy are about more than the latest job figures. “When people complain about the economy, what they’re really complaining about is the longer-term failure in certain parts of the country - rural America’s de-industrialised communities,” he says. “Those are parts of the country that are hurting even in a good economy.” For most of the election season, Trump has fared better than Harris when voters are asked who they think would do a better job with the economy, including in a recent CNN poll. But there are signs his lead may not be set in stone, such as a Cook Political Report survey of swing states that showed the two candidates tied on who would be best at dealing with inflation. One looming economic pitfall for Democrats also evaporated this week - the dockworkers strike, which had briefly shut down critical ports on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico for the first time in 50 years. Both parties agreed to return to the bargaining table in January, reopening the ports. If a work stoppage had continued, it could have disrupted supply chains and driven up consumer prices in the weeks before the election.  Meanwhile, undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border have returned to pre-Covid pandemic levels, after hitting a record high of 249,741 last December. While the impact of that border surge is still being felt in many American cities, the urgency of the crisis may be diminishing. While much of this week’s news could spell trouble for Harris and the Democrats, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for Trump. His conduct during the 6 January attack on the US Capitol once again came into focus on Wednesday, when a federal judge released a document from special counsel Jack Smith outlining his case and evidence against Donald Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election result. The document, which argued that the former president should not be given presidential immunity from prosecution, contained new details about Trump’s words and actions leading up to the Capitol riot by his supporters. A recent CNN poll shows that voters favour Harris over Trump on issues of “protecting democracy” by 47% to 40% - so anything that renews attention on the chaotic final weeks of Trump’s presidency could be to the Democrat’s advantage. The term “October surprise” has been a fixture in American political lexicon for nearly 50 years. Campaigns dread the unexpected headline or crisis that pushes their candidates off message and changes the trajectory of a race. Even the smallest ripple in public opinion might deliver the White House in a year when the electoral margins in the swing states could be measured in only tens of thousands of votes. November’s balloting, says Mr Greenberg, is shaping up to be a nail-biter. “I don’t have any fingernails left,” he says. “I could totally imagine this election going either way with extremely significant consequences riding on that vote no matter where your loyalty is.” North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4x6dwqlxgo,"Israel strike kills 22 in Gaza school, says Hamas-run health ministry","Israel says it hit a Hamas command centre, while Palestinian officials said most killed were women and children.",21 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:26.172446,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Israeli air strike on a school in Gaza City has killed at least 22 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The school, closed during the war, was housing displaced people, the health ministry said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted a Hamas command centre which Israel said the militant group was using to ""plan and carry out terrorist attacks”. Hamas has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes. Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting The Hamas-run government media office said the people killed in Saturday's strike in the al-Zaytoun area included several children and six women.  Gaza's civil defence agency reported the same death toll and added that one of the women was pregnant. Several graphic videos of the aftermath of the strike examined by BBC Verify appear to corroborate this. Other footage shows children among the victims. Some are seen with severe injuries, including parts of their legs missing. Others are seen lying motionless while adults try to deliver CPR. BBC Verify confirmed the location by comparing details seen in the background to satellite and ground-level images of the targeted school. The IDF said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, and accused Hamas of exploiting civilian infrastructure. Hamas ""systematically violates international law by operating from inside civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip and exploiting the Gazan civilian population for its terrorist activities"", the IDF said. Also on Saturday, the health ministry said that four of its workers were killed and six injured in an Israeli ""targeting"" of a health ministry warehouse in the Musabah area of southern Gaza. The ministry did not specify whether the incident was an air strike. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment on the report of health workers killed. Other schools have been hit, some several times, by Israeli air strikes since the latest conflict with Hamas began on 7 October. Earlier this month, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said six of its employees were killed in an Israeli air strike on al-Jaouni school in Nuseirat refugee camp, which is being used as a shelter by thousands of displaced Palestinians. Unrwa said it was the fifth time the school had been hit since 7 October. Israel's military said it carried out a “precise strike on terrorists” planning attacks from the school. The military alleged that nine of those killed were members of Hamas’s armed wing and that three of them were Unrwa staff. Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,000 people, according to the health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl8v1z1zeo,Israel says 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers hit in Lebanon,Extensive Israeli air strikes come after Hezbollah vowed to retaliate over deadly exploding device attacks blamed on Israel.,20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:26.456276,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has carried out extensive air strikes on southern Lebanon, saying its warplanes have hit more than 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and other ""terrorist sites"" including a weapons storage facility. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the launchers were ready to be fired against Israel. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israel carried out at least 52 strikes in the south of the country on Thursday evening. Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it had also launched strikes on military sites in northern Israel. The Israeli air strikes, which lasted more than two hours, were some of the most intense of the recent conflict. On Friday morning, Israel lifted orders restricting movement that it had issued on Thursday for communities in the Golan Heights and parts of northern Israel, its military confirmed. The IDF added it would be carrying out ""activities in the training areas"" of northern Israel over the weekend and that ""gunshots and explosions"" might be heard in nearby settlements. Earlier, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said deadly explosions earlier in the week ""crossed all red lines"", accusing Israel of what he said represented a declaration of war. Israel has not said it was behind the attacks - which saw pagers and walkie-talkies explode simultaneously across the country - on Tuesday and Wednesday, and which Lebanese authorities said killed 37 people and wounded 3,000. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said Israel is embarking on a ""new phase of the war"", concentrating more of its efforts on the north. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in the cross-border fighting, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Chief nursing officer Hisham Bawadi told the BBC that the medical centre where he works in Beirut received a ""tsunami of patients"" after the explosions. ""Most of the injuries were facial with mainly the eyes, the face affected, the upper extremities, and some injuries on the abdomen,"" he said. A number of planned surgeries will be taking place over the weekend to ""be able to cater for the high number of casualties"" caused by the exploding pagers, he added.  Two firms based in Taiwan and Hungary accused in media reports of manufacturing the pagers have both denied responsibility, with the Taiwanese government saying the different parts of the pagers were not from Taiwan. ""The components are low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries, I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan,"" Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said. Bulgaria's state security agency DANS  also said none of the pagers that exploded during Tuesday's bomb attacks in Lebanon were imported to, exported from, or made in Bulgaria, after local media reports said a company there had facilitated the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. In a statement late on Thursday, the IDF said its warplanes ""struck approximately 100 launchers and additional terrorist infrastructure sites, consisting of approximately 1,000 barrels that were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory"". ""The IDF will continue to operate to degrade the Hezbollah terrorist organisation’s infrastructure and capabilities in order to defend the state of Israel."" Lebanese security sources cited by Reuters news agency and the New York Times said the Israeli strikes were among the most intense since the war in Gaza began in October last year. The IDF also urged residents in northern Israel close to the Lebanese border to avoid large gatherings, guard their neighbourhoods and stay close to bomb shelters. On Thursday morning, Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon fired two anti-tank missiles across the border, followed by drones. The IDF said two Israeli soldiers were killed and a third seriously wounded.  In his televised address on Thursday, Hassan Nasrallah said of Tuesday and Wednesday's attacks: “The enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines. It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally."" He added: “This is massacre, a major aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security. It can be called war crimes or a declaration of war - whatever you choose to name it, it is deserving and fits the description. This was the enemy's intention.” As Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes caused sonic booms over Beirut, scaring an already exhausted population, while others struck targets in southern Lebanon. The Hezbollah leader acknowledged that this was a massive and unprecedented blow for his group, but he insisted that its ability to command and communicate remained intact. Nasrallah’s tone was defiant and he vowed a harsh punishment. But again, he indicated that Hezbollah was not interested in an escalation of its current conflict with Israel. The group’s cross-border attacks, he said, were going to continue unless there was a ceasefire in Gaza, and no killings or assassinations would return residents to northern Israel. The IDF said on Thursday that its chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, had “recently completed approval of plans for the northern arena”. Gallant later said that ""in the new phase of the war, there are significant opportunities but also significant risks”. “Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” he added. “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price.” It is not clear how Israel intends to achieve this goal. But reports earlier this week suggested that the general in charge of the IDF’s Northern Command favoured the creation of an Israeli-controlled buffer zone inside southern Lebanon. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for restraint on all sides.  ""We don't want to see any escalatory actions by any party"" that would make the goal of achieving a ceasefire in Gaza more difficult, he said as he joined European foreign ministers in Paris to discuss the widening crisis. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who was also at the talks in Paris, called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. ""We are all very, very clear that we want to see a negotiated political settlement so that Israelis can return to their homes in northern Israel and indeed Lebanese to return to their homes,"" he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9wyy9pr2o,Top Hezbollah commanders killed in Israeli strike on Beirut,"The strike in Lebanon's capital, which killed at least 31 people, adds to fears of an all-out war.",21 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:26.549397,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Israeli airstrike on a residential area of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has killed two top Hezbollah military commanders and other senior officials, in a major escalation that has added to fears of an all-out war. Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia and political group, confirmed the death of Ibrahim Aqil, a senior commander in the group’s elite Radwan forces. The group also confirmed that Ahmed Wahbi, himself a top Radwan figure, died in the attack that hit the densely populated Dahieh area - a stronghold of the group. Senior UN official Rosemary DiCarlo warned that the Middle East was at risk of a conflict that could ""dwarf"" the devastation witnessed in the region so far. Friday’s attack was another major blow for Hezbollah and the first airstrike to hit Beirut since July, when Fuad Shukr, a right-hand man to leader Hassan Nasrallah, was killed.  It happened just days after a wave of explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies used by the group that killed dozens, wounded thousands more and caused panic in a country already exhausted by almost one year of conflict.  Israel is widely believed to have been behind the attack, but has made no comment. In Beirut, there were chaotic scenes as emergency teams rushed to the site of the attack on Friday, rescuing the wounded and searching for people believed to be trapped under the rubble.  At least one residential building collapsed and others were heavily damaged. Streets were closed by Hezbollah members, some looking incredulous. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 31 people were killed in the attack - including three children and seven women - with dozens more wounded. In a statement, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said Aqil, a senior commander in Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces, was killed alongside senior operatives in the group’s operations staff and other Radwan commanders. Hagari said they ""were gathered underground under a residential building in the heart of the Dahiyah neighbourhood [in southern Beirut], hiding among Lebanese civilians, using them as human shields"". The IDF spokesman added that the individuals killed were “planning Hezbollah’s 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan, in which Hezbollah intended to infiltrate Israeli communities and murder innocent civilians"". The plan was first reported by the Israeli military in 2018, when the IDF said it was blocking tunnels dug by Hezbollah to penetrate Israeli territory and kidnap and murder civilians. In April, Washington said it was searching for Aqil, also known as Tahsin, and offered financial rewards to anyone with ""information leading to his identification, location, arrest and/or conviction"". He was wanted by the US because of his links and seniority within Hezbollah, a group that has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.  In the 1980s, Aqil was a member of the group that orchestrated the bombings of the US embassy in Beirut and a marine barracks, killing hundreds of people. Confirming Aqil's death in a post on social media, Hezbollah described him as one of its ""great jihadist leaders"".  The group was established in the early 1980s by the region's most dominant Shia power, Iran, to oppose Israel. At the time, Israel's forces had occupied southern Lebanon during the country's civil war. On Saturday, Hezbollah said the second commander to be killed, Wahbi, had ""participated in many operations"" since the 1980s. It said Wahbi, 60, held many roles within Hezbollah including ""assuming responsibility"" for the militant group's elite Radwan force until early 2024. Earlier on Friday, Hezbollah said it had launched strikes on military sites in northern Israel. The IDF said 140 rockets were fired into the north of the country, while Israeli police issued warnings about damage to roads. It came after Israel carried out extensive air strikes on southern Lebanon, saying its warplanes had hit more than 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and other ""terrorist sites"" including a weapons storage facility. The cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then, hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in the cross-border fighting, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Israel recently added the return of people displaced from the north of the country to its list of war goals, and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday that his country was entering a ""new phase of the war"", concentrating more of its efforts on the north.  After the pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon earlier this week, there has been a deepened sense of unease in the Middle Eastern country.  It was an unprecedented security breach that indicated how deeply Israel had managed to penetrate the group’s communication system. Many of the explosions occurred simultaneously, with walkie-talkie explosions on Wednesday occurring in the vicinity of a large crowd that had gathered for the funerals of four victims of Tuesday's pager blasts. Hezbollah and Lebanese authorities have blamed Israel for the explosions.  Israeli officials have not commented on the allegations, but most analysts agree that it is behind the attack. In a televised address on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said: “The enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines. It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally."" Nasrallah vowed a harsh punishment, but indicated his group was not interested in an escalation of its current conflict with Israel. Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habbib told the UN Security Council on Friday that Israel had ""deliberately undermined"" diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza and ""all attempts of the Lebanese government to de-escalate and exercise self-restraint"". Israel's UN envoy Danny Danon said that while his country is not seeking a wider conflict, it ""will not allow Hezbollah to continue its provocation"".  UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council: ""We risk seeing a conflagration that could dwarf even the devastation and suffering witnessed so far.""  She added: ""I also strongly urge member states with influence over the parties to leverage it now."" US and UK authorities have urged their citizens not to travel to Lebanon. The White House said it was involved in intense diplomacy to prevent escalation of the conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. "

The Irish Defence Forces have 382 personnel serving between the United Nations missions in the region. Irish troops have been serving in the region since 1978. More than 90,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Monday, according to the UN. Israel's military is carrying out a new wave of ""extensive"" strikes in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa area. Fifty-one people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Wednesday, Lebanon's health ministry has said. Meanwhile, the Irish government has urged all remaining Irish civilians in Lebanon to leave immediately. ""Those not in a position to do so should ensure that they are registered with the Irish Embassy in Cairo,"" according to the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) Simon Harris, who met the leader of Palestine on Wednesday in New York, condemned the strikes on Lebanon. “We continue to see a dangerous escalation and loss of life in the Middle East,"" Mr Harris said. “I utterly condemn the bombing of civilian areas in southern Lebanon by Israel and the firing of rockets towards civilian areas in Israel by Hezbollah. “There has been a shocking loss of life this week, but even at this stage it is not too late for all sides to step back from the brink. “Gaza is in ruins and in desperate need of the world’s help."" Mr Harris added that opening a second front in Lebanon would be a ""disaster"" risking an all-out war with profound consequences for the region and the world. “I have met the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, and received a briefing and situational report on the peacekeeping missing in Southern Lebanon,"" he said. “Irish troops serving in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNFIL) are well trained and following all protocols.''

The High Court has agreed to drop an arrest order against David’s father, Dr Mustapha Nahle, if he allows the child to board a flight to the UK. But a special mediator who flew to the Lebanese capital to try to bring David home says Dr Nahle has so far refused to accept the arrangement. The mediator, Miceál O’Hurley, called on the British and Irish prime ministers to make a direct appeal to their Lebanese counterpart. Dr Nahle has kept David, who turns three next week, in Beirut since 2022. David travelled there with his mother Catherine Flanagan on a British passport, but Dr Nahle refused to let him leave again and as a result is a fugitive from UK authorities. He has refused to obey a UK court order for David’s return, saying a Lebanese court has granted him custody. As violence in Lebanon escalated this week, the High Court in Belfast granted an urgent order which offered to stay a charge of contempt against Dr Nahle if he allowed David to evacuate. Mr O’Hurley flew to the Beirut on Wednesday and had secured a seat for the Belfast-born child on a plane carrying evacuees on Thursday – but that flight took off without him. Mr O’Hurley told BBC News NI he was in phone contact with Dr Nahle but he has so far rejected the deal. “I regret that I was unable to evacuate David from Beirut,” Mr O’Hurley said. “The cooperation required to see David home was not forthcoming by his father in Lebanon. “Still, I pray to God another opportunity to evacuate David will arise.”  Because David is a citizen of the UK, Ireland and Lebanon, Mr O’Hurley called on the prime ministers of the three countries to become involved. “We’ve asked that Prime Minister Starmer and an Taoiseach Simon Harris telephone their counterpart, Najib Mikati to request his assistance with David’s evacuation.” A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was providing consular assistance and was in contact with local authorities in Lebanon.  The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said it is aware of the case and has provided advice and guidance.  BBC Spotlight tracked down David’s father in Beirut last month and he told the programme he did not intend to allow his son to leave Lebanon. The latest development comes days after Israel launched an invasion of Lebanon. Attacks in southern Beirut, where it is believed David is living with his father, killed nine people overnight. Israel has warned people in dozens of places in southern Lebanon to evacuate. Spotlight: My Son In A Warzone is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y8emq35y1o,Pregnant British woman's 'guilt' over fleeing Lebanon,"Alla Ghalayini, who arrived in London on Sunday, says she can ""still hear the bombs"" from Israeli air strikes.",29 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:26.788553,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A British woman who fled Lebanon after fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified has said she feels ""terrible and guilty"" for leaving. ""I'm still in denial,"" Alaa Ghalayini told the BBC. ""I can't sleep. I still hear the bombs in my head."" The 28-year-old is nearly two months pregnant with her first child. She looked exhausted as she arrived at London's Heathrow Airport aboard a Middle East Airlines flight with two large suitcases on Sunday morning. She says she left her husband behind - along with the life she loved. There has been fighting between Israel and Hezbollah across the Lebanese border since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas. The Iran-backed militia, which is based in Lebanon, said it would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza.  In recent weeks, Israel has attacked areas it says are Hezbollah strongholds in different parts of Lebanon, including the capital, Beirut.  On Saturday, an Israeli strike in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, with Israel saying 20 more of the group's senior members were killed in the attack.  Ms Ghalayini moved to Beirut from north London when she married in August last year. She said she had no idea when she would see her husband again, or if she will be able to return to Lebanon before her baby is born. Ms Ghalayini said the only commercial airline she could find leaving Beirut was Middle East Airlines - and she was only able to get a seat because her husband is a pilot for the company.  ""I feel terrible and guilty that I have been able to leave,"" she said. ""I didn’t want to leave my husband. My heart is with him."" She said Beirut Airport, where she departed from, was ""chaotic"" and ""rammed with people"", adding that the plane did not have an empty seat. ""[The flight] was obviously emotional - everyone had a story.  ""Everyone on the plane felt at ease as soon as the airplane left Lebanese airspace. That’s because areas very close by to the airport were being bombed."" Ms Ghalayini said that, before she had left, the situation in the country felt ""unbearable"".  ""We were screaming. Hiding in the bathroom. I live on the 23rd floor, so I was seeing my city burn. You feel helpless. ""Being born and raised in London, I've never experienced anything like this. ""No one should have to go through what we've gone through."" Nadine, another UK national, broke down in tears as she told the BBC: ""We couldn’t sleep, we were so worried about our families and friends and we couldn't even find flights for them to come here."" She travelled from her home in London to Heathrow to meet her two teenage daughters who had landed from Beirut that morning. Lea, 17, and Yasmina, 15, are UK nationals but up until now have lived in Beirut with their grandparents. The family asked for their surnames not to be used.  As Israeli airstrikes escalated in the country, the family decided to get the girls out. They had left behind most of their belongings, as well as their friends and school. Lea said: “It was all unexpected. Just got the tickets, two days later we’re at the airport. ""It’s really scary and sad not knowing when you’re going to come back to your home country, not knowing what’s going to happen to your family and friends there."" Lea added: ""I don't really want to experience the sleepless nights anymore. I hope I feel better here and forget about the trauma."" Nadine said she was relieved to know her girls had arrived safely, but was in fear for those left behind. ""My sister, their kids are traumatised. They're seeing the bombs from their balconies, from the streets."" The family say the girls' grandparents plan to leave Beirut on Monday to find someplace safe. BBC News understands there are between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals including their dependents in Lebanon. The Foreign Office told UK nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately on Saturday due to the escalating violence. ""We encourage you to book the next available flight, even if it is not a direct route,"" it said in its official advice.  In a post on X, it said it was working ""to increase capacity and secure seats for British nationals to leave”.  UK nationals in Lebanon have been told to register their presence to receive the latest information."

In July, the University of Sheffield obtained legal powers to remove the camp set up by the Sheffield Campus Coalition for Palestine (SCCP) outside the students' union. In a bid to continue their protest, activists arrived at Weston Park on Monday to raise awareness about what they say is ""the university's complicity in the Israel-Gaza war"" due to links with arms firms. Sheffield City Council, which looks after the park, said it was aware of the encampment and would monitor activity over the coming days. The University of Sheffield declined to comment when approached by the BBC. The first encampment set up by the SCCP on 1 May was ordered to leave following a court judgment in July. During the hearing, the university said protesters did not have permission for the camp and had ""ignored"" health and safety concerns. According to the SCCP, the encampment had been a ""place of inspiration, growth, love and safety"" for those ""heartbroken"" by the Israel-Gaza war which followed the Hamas attack on Israel last October. The attack killed about 1,200 people and more than 250 others were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,000 people, the Hamas-run health ministry said. The SCCP said it hoped the new camp would prompt the university to ""sever its ties with arms manufacturers"" and ""to boycott Israeli companies and institutions"". One member of the encampment said: “It's evident that the University of Sheffield believes that their eviction of our 93-day encampment marked the end of our demands. ""SCCP's steadfast statement is that we are just beginning and that we will not be silenced."" The camp, which consists of several tents and gazebos, would remain at the park until the end of the month, the group said, with educational events held throughout the week. Sheffield City Council's Kurtis Crossland, chair of the communities, parks and leisure committee, said: “We are aware of the encampment that has been set up in Weston Park and along with our partners at South Yorkshire Police will be monitoring protests and activity, which are currently peaceful, over the coming days.” Listen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79n1v4d203o,Hezbollah leader says exploding device attacks crossed 'all red lines',"Hassan Nasrallah calls the killing of 37 people by exploding pagers and radios an ""unprecedented blow"".",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:37.910243,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hezbollah’s leader has said bomb attacks using thousands of the Lebanese armed group's pagers and radios ""crossed all red lines"", and accused Israel of what he said represented a declaration of war. In a much-anticipated speech, Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged Hezbollah had suffered an “unprecedented blow”, but he vowed it would continue fighting and inflict a “just punishment”. Israel has not said it was behind the blasts on Tuesday and Wednesday, which Lebanese authorities said killed 37 people and wounded 3,000. As Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes caused sonic booms over Beirut, scaring an already-exhausted population, and others struck targets in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it was operating to “degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure” and to “bring security to northern Israel”. Eleven months of cross-border fighting between Hezbollah and Israel sparked by the war in Gaza have killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border.  Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. There were no surprises in Hassan Nasrallah’s televised address on Thursday afternoon - his first public reaction to the exploding device attacks which created panic across Lebanon and raised fears of another major war between Hezbollah and Israel. In what was a humiliating security breach, 12 people were killed, including two children, when pagers used by Hezbollah members to communicate blew up almost simultaneously across the country on Tuesday, according to Lebanon’s health minister. Another 25 were killed when walkie-talkies exploded the next day. Reports citing Lebanese and US sources said Israeli intelligence operatives were likely to have planted small amounts of explosives inside the devices or their batteries. “The enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines. It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally,” Nasrallah said. “This is massacre, a major aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security. It can be called war crimes or a declaration of war - whatever you choose to name it, it is deserving and fits the description. This was the enemy's intention,” he added. The Hezbollah leader acknowledged that this was a massive and unprecedented blow for his group, but he insisted that its ability to command and communicate remained intact. Nasrallah’s tone was defiant and he vowed a harsh punishment. But, again, he indicated that Hezbollah was not interested in an escalation of its current conflict with Israel. The group’s cross-border attacks, he said, were going to continue unless there was a ceasefire in Gaza, and that no killings or assassinations would return residents to northern Israel. Shortly before the speech, crowds of Hezbollah supporters gathered in the capital’s southern suburbs to bury two members killed on Tuesday. Some people said they had been shaken by the explosions, but that they were determined to resist. On Thursday morning, Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon fired two anti-tank missiles across the border, followed by drones. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said two Israeli soldiers were killed and a third seriously wounded. The latest exchanges come at a time when Israel says its military focus has shifted away from Gaza to the situation in the north. The IDF said on Thursday that its chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, had “recently completed approval of plans for the northern arena”. Later, at a meeting of military and intelligence chiefs, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: “In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks.” “Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” he added. “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price.” It is not clear how Israel intends to achieve this goal. But reports earlier this week suggested that the general in charge of the IDF’s Northern Command favoured the creation of an Israeli-controlled buffer zone inside southern Lebanon. In his speech, Hassan Nasrallah called the general a fool and said that any such move would have dire consequences for Israel."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dj1743nd6o,Mum fears for Belfast toddler who won’t be leaving Lebanon,The BBC speaks to a father in Beirut after the High Court rules his son should be returned to his mother in Belfast.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:38.014332,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A mother has said that the Foreign Office is failing her son, who is being kept in Lebanon in defiance of a UK court order. David Nahle was taken by his father during a trip to Beirut in 2022 when he was 10 months old. Dr Mustapha Ali Nahle has refused to abide by a High Court ruling for his son to be returned to Northern Ireland, saying he has been granted custody in Lebanon. BBC Spotlight travelled to Lebanon to interview Dr Nahle, who said he would not be returning David to his mother, adding that he believes his son is safe. The Foreign Office said it had “provided consular assistance to a British woman who was in Lebanon and been in contact with local authorities.”. On Monday night Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon. David’s mother, Catherine Flanagan from Belfast, said she was increasingly worried about her son, who is now almost three. “Every time I see that there’s been an airstrike, I’m checking where exactly that is in relation to different places where I know they might have David. “It’s widespread violence, widespread bombings,” she said.  Ms Flanagan told the BBC in early September that she had not seen or spoken to her son in more than a year. There has been fighting between Israel and Hezbollah across the Lebanese border since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas. The Iran-backed militia, which is based in Lebanon, said it would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks, Israel has carried out airstrikes across Lebanon, including in the capital Beirut. The Foreign Office has told all British citizens to leave the country. David, who travelled to Lebanon on a British passport, is being kept in Beirut by his father. Dr Nahle is now considered a fugitive from UK authorities. Ms Flanagan claims her questions to the Foreign Office about David’s case have gone unanswered. “Nobody has gotten back to me or told me what they are doing, that is not acceptable. “David’s rights as a British citizen, as my son, are being trampled all over. I find it extremely, extremely negligent,” she said. She fears for David who will celebrate his third birthday next week in a warzone. “There's not a second of the day that I'm not thinking about David. When I sleep, I'm dreaming about him. BBC Spotlight travelled to Beirut to track down David’s father, who is a consultant anaesthetist in Lebanon’s largest hospital. Speaking days before the most recent escalation in attacks, he told the BBC he had been granted custody by a Lebanese court, and would not be returning David to his mother. ""I am Lebanese, I live in Lebanon, I obey for Lebanese laws, that’s it"". Dr Nahle added: ""I feel David is safe and I have some safety measures. ""The world, in our lives, we don’t have the hundred percent safety, in UK they don’t have it, in Belfast they have riots, they have racial riots too."" David’s parents married in 2021 but the home office rejected Dr Nahle's application for a visitor visa to the UK. After their marriage broke down, Dr Nahle took David from Ms Flanagan, citing concerns for his son’s safety. In 2023, the High Court in Belfast awarded Catherine custody and ordered Dr Nahle to return David to live in Northern Ireland.  That did not happen. Ms Flanagan told the BBC she fears her son is at risk in the country. “I can't believe that his father, who does love him, would do such a thing to me, would do such a thing to David.” Miceál O‘Hurley is an independent mediator between David’s parents, and thinks the escalation in violence may change Dr Nahle's thinking. “I accept that Mustapha and his family love this child. If you've seen a video of him, he's happy, bouncy, chubby-cheeked. “He loves his son. But now it's about putting his needs first,” he said. Mr O’Hurley also believes the government should be doing more to ensure David is evacuated from the country. “The government is so concerned we have now a level four evacuation for all British citizens. “It ought not to take a ground war, or missiles falling on your head, or dying because a pager explodes in the property next door to get us to marshal our attention to save a child.” Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said he'd ""like to see our government doing more for David"". ""All [Catherine's] asking for is the Foreign Office stand over and support her desire to be reunited with her son... that shouldn’t be a big ask, but seemingly the Foreign Office is not engaged in much behind the scenes,"" Robinson told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Mr Robinson described it as ""an appalling state of affairs"" and said there has been ""successive foreign secretaries and successive governments"" in place, but ""little in the way of progress"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8jg0x5xg8o,Israel investigates after its soldiers filmed throwing bodies off roof,"The IDF says the incident does not ""conform"" to its values, while Palestinian officials say it is a ""crime"".",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:38.112820,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's military has launched an investigation after its soldiers were filmed throwing the bodies of three dead Palestinians off a rooftop during a raid in the occupied West Bank.  Footage of the incident, filmed in the northern town of Qabatiya, near Jenin, then appears to show an Israeli military bulldozer picking up and removing the bodies. The images have sparked widespread outrage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that it was “a serious incident” that did not “conform” to its values and what was expected of its forces. Local Palestinian officials say at least seven people were killed by Israeli forces in Qabatiya on Thursday. Under international law, soldiers are obliged to ensure that bodies, including those of enemy fighters, are treated with respect.  The IDF said it carried out a counterterrorism operation in Qabatiya, during which  four militants were killed in an ""exchange of fire"" and three others were killed after a drone strike on a car. A journalist in Qabatiya told the BBC that on Thursday morning Israeli troops had surrounded a building in town.  He described how four men who were in the house then escaped to the roof and were shot by snipers.  Fighting continued in the town and when it had subsided, he then said he saw Israeli troops go up to the roof and drop the bodies down over the side, where they were then loaded onto a bulldozer. Asked about the incident shown in the footage, the IDF said: ""This is a serious incident that does not conform with [our] values and the expectations from IDF soldiers. The incident is under review."" The military said that one of those killed in Qabatiya was Shadi Zakarneh, who it identified as being ""responsible for directing and carrying out attacks in the northern West Bank area"". It said he was ""the head of the terrorist organisation"" in Qabatiya but did not specify which group he belonged to. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, in the West Bank, described the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter, as a ""crime"" which exposed the ""brutality"" of the Israeli army. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby described the footage as ""deeply disturbing"". ""If it's proven to be authentic, it clearly would depict abhorrent and egregious behaviour by professional soldiers,"" he told reporters.  There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. More than 690 Palestinians have been killed there since then, the Palestinian health ministry says, as Israeli forces have intensified their nearly daily search and arrest raids. Israel says it is trying to stem Palestinian attacks in the West Bank and Israel, in which at least 33 Israelis have been killed.  In Gaza, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9p1vyne8xo,British nationals tell of 'surreal' Lebanon evacuation,"Student Isobel Taper says it feels ""surreal"" being back in the UK, having left her boyfriend and cats in Beirut.",3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:38.209339,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A British woman who was among more than 150 people to be evacuated from Lebanon on Wednesday has described her anguish at leaving her life in the Middle Eastern country behind. Isobel Taper told the BBC: ""My life is out there, so it feels strange being back here."" The 31-year-old arrived in Birmingham on board the first flight chartered by the UK government, after it urged UK nationals to leave immediately amid escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.  Even though she is now staying with her parents in Ealing, west London, Ms Taper said she feels guilty for leaving her boyfriend and cats in Lebanon.  ""Everything just feels very surreal,"" she said. Since Wednesday's flight, the UK government has said it will charter a ""limited"" number of flights from Beirut to evacuate ""hundreds"" of British nationals and their dependents. The Foreign Office said the flights would continue ""as long as the security situation allows"", with more departing on Thursday. Ms Taper was studying for a master's degree in Beirut, having moved to Lebanon in July last year. She said she decided to leave when the conflict spread to the part of the city where she was staying. ""They hit downtown Beirut and I think now it's got to the point where there's nowhere safe, so I decided to leave. I'm really, really hoping I can go back."" Ms Taper added: ""My parents have been so worried. I wanted to come back and give them some peace of mind."" She said the evacuation felt ""rushed"" and that she received an email confirming her seat on the evacuation flight around four hours before it took off. Although her boyfriend used to live in London and his grandfather is British, Ms Taper said, ""it's his home - he wants to stay there"".  Dia, 81, and Amine, 88, are dual British-Lebanese nationals, but moved back to Beirut from London when they retired in 2000.  Their daughter, Mona Deeley, who lives in London, was able to secure a space for Dia on the flight, but told the BBC of her ""hard"" decision to leave Amine - who needs 24-hour care - behind. ""A normal trip is gruelling at their age, let alone an evacuation,"" she said. Elderly people have to think about ""not only whether a bomb is going to fall on your heads or not"" but also ""not having access to your medication, to your doctor, to your hospital"", Ms Deeley added.  ""With my mum, it felt like now or never.  ""She can't change anything for him on the ground, she can't lift him up and nurse him herself - so in a very hard way, it was more reassuring for us to have one of them here."" Both Ms Taper and Ms Deeley say their families have been affected by the escalating conflict in Lebanon. Ms Deeley said her parents were anxiously waiting to hear whether her grandparents' grave in the Bashoura Muslim cemetery in central Beirut had been damaged in an air strike on Wednesday. Ms Taper said her boyfriend's work as a musician has ""completely disappeared"" and she worries about other people who now find themselves without work.  ""It’s one of the forgotten things that we don't think about in war, how it affects so many industries. It affects so many aspects of people's lives. I just constantly think: 'It's not going to get too bad,' then every day it does get worse."" As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. Some have been able to leave on commercial flights - but said empty seats were hard to find. The Foreign Office said it was working to increase capacity on commercial flights for British nationals, and that around 700 troops and government staff had been deployed to Cyprus for ""contingency planning"". Israel has stepped up its aerial assault of Beirut in the past week, targeting densely populated areas that it says are home to Hezbollah leaders and military equipment. On Tuesday, Israeli ground forces entered southern Lebanon in what it described as a ""limited and targeted"" incursion. Iran later launched a barrage of missiles toward Israel, exacerbating fears of a growing regional conflict. Additional reporting by Sherie Ryder"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2rglnn42o,"'Send us a plane', Britons in Lebanon urge PM",More Britons in Lebanon tell the BBC about the increasingly desperate situation there as war looms.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:38.301726,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"British nationals stranded in Lebanon under Israeli bombardments are calling for the UK government to send evacuation planes as commercial flights out become very difficult to secure. Dan Harper and his wife and two children drove out of their home in the hills outside Beirut on Thursday to seek shelter with their extended family at a village further north. ""The government are saying very strongly now, 'British should leave, British must leave now'. But the messaging is very strange because there are no flights - there are no seats on any flights out of Beirut,"" he told the BBC. ""When the message comes from Keir Starmer: 'Brits leave now', well, our reply is send us a plane then!"" Lebanon's capital has been shelled since Monday as part of wider Israeli military strikes into the country, which have killed more than 630 people, and injured more than 1,600. Cross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have left tens of thousands of people displaced on both sides. With Israel's military indicating it could launch a ground invasion in coming days, Mr Harper told the BBC his family would take any evacuation flights but currently there were no options. He said his calls to the UK embassy in Lebanon had gone unanswered, telling the BBC they were rerouted to a UK desk. It's estimated there are up to 6,000 UK nationals including dependents in Lebanon - some of whom have managed to secure last seats on departing commercial flights this week. But Mr Harper's concerns echo those of many British nationals in Lebanon who say they have made the decision to leave or are trying to leave but cannot get on planes.  International airlines have stopped flying in and out of the Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport, the country's only commercial airport,  leaving only Middle East Airlines, Iraqi Airways and Iran Air operational. If the situation escalates into an invasion or strikes near where they had moved to now, Mr Harper said his family would also consider evacuating via sea - a route already being pursued by some Britons. The BBC spoke to one student on Wednesday who said she was fleeing north to the city of Tripoli, from where she would attempt to get a boat out of the country to Turkey. Mr Harper said he considered his family's situation fortunate compared to other areas in Lebanon - given they were living in areas ""where it's very unlikely the war will get there"". He feared for his friends in the south, he said, in areas that have borne the brunt of Israeli army's strikes which have also targeted the Bekaa Valley region in the east and in parts in the capital too. From their home in Monte Verde, a 20-minute drive from the city centre and half an hour from the country's airport, his family had heard the explosions. It is considered a safe area but ""the noises of the sonic boom have made us feel afraid, have made the children feel afraid and we are worried that it can escalate. And it could be a ground invasion or similar to [the] 2006 [war]."" Having lived in Lebanon for over two decades, he and his wife, who is Lebanese, had heeded warnings first issued by Western countries last October to get out of the country - they had travelled to the UK during the summer and came back only last week ""because school was starting and it was looking reasonably calm."" ""A lot of people have said 'well, why haven’t the Brits left? Well, we can’t leave indefinitely so that’s one thing. Our lives are here."" But then the pager attacks occurred on 18 September, a prelude to a series of other strikes. Mr Harper said: ""I've been here for 25 years so I've realised it's part and parcel of living in this region - you're going to have things like this happen. But when you’ve got children obviously, it's different priorities."" He said talks of a potential ceasefire offer some hope that life could return to normal. ""We have to remain positive and hope they'll find a solution and we can carry on with our lives and kids can co back to school. ""But it is looking less and less likely as this goes on."" Israel has rejected calls for a temporary 21-day ceasefire from the US, UK, and the EU. The BBC has sought comment from the UK government over its plans in Lebanon to help British nationals. The Foreign Office has previously said: ""The government is planning for a range of scenarios and is prepared to provide additional support to British nationals if required."" Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC on Wednesday he could not go into detail about evacuation plans but contingency measures were in place. The government has sent about 700 additional military personnel to Cyprus in case an emergency evacuation is required.  The UK already has a significant diplomatic and military presence close to Lebanon, including RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and two Royal Navy ships - RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan - which have been in the eastern Mediterranean over the summer. The RAF also has planes and helicopters on standby.   "

Six Muslim and six Jewish women met at St John’s Church in Waterloo in central London to talk about the impact the conflict in the Middle East is having on communities in the UK. In what was described as a safe space by organisers, the group shared their feelings of “exhaustion, pain and suffering”. They were also keen to express their “hope and gratitude” which they felt had come from similar acts of unity. Organisers Julie Siddiqi, a Muslim, and Laura Marks, who is Jewish, are co-founders of the Nisa-Nashim Jewish and Muslim Women’s Network. They said the meeting was a symbol of cross-faith unity against hatred and “not being made to feel we have to pick sides”. Ms Marks said: “One year on and here we are: The world feels a worse place.  ""Our responsibility is to ensure we do everything to stop the hate on our streets, to make them feel safe for our children, for our grandchildren, so that the world can actually become a safer place for them to be.  ""That can only be done if you do it together."" Members were asked to share their feelings and thoughts on what is happening in the Middle East, and how the war had affected them and their communities. Ms Siddiqi said: “We heard it all today. None of it surprised me. People were talking about literally being exhausted. It’s been a very heavy year. “We need to not allow extreme voices to be the only voices, the loud voices that often try to divide more than connect. “None of us are saying that we have to agree on everything, but it’s so important for us to stand against hatred together and not be made to feel that we have to pick sides, or we have to only sit in this box or this box.” The gathering came after tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through London on Saturday. The Metropolitan Police said it made at least 17 arrests - on suspicion of a number of offences including supporting a proscribed organisation, public order breaches, and assault.

The Israeli Embassy in Dublin has labelled Higgins' comments as ""baseless"", ""highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous"". The Irish president was criticised last month when the letter to Masoud Pezeshkian became public, following Pezeshkian's appointment as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Speaking at the United Nations (UN) in New York on Sunday, Higgins said he believed that his letter had been circulated by Israeli officials. ""You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose,"" Higgins said. Pressed by journalists as to where he believed the letter came from, Higgins said he believed ""it was circulated from the Israeli embassy"" in Dublin. Higgins said he wrote to congratulate a new head of state and that there had been some interest in re-starting nuclear talks with Iran. He told Pezeshkian that Iran had a ""crucial role"" in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. ""I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi,"" the letter read. The letter appeared in the Jewish Chronicle and prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland. In a statement, the Israeli embassy said: ""Unfortunately in Ireland, since the October 7 invasion by Hamas and massacre in Israel, which triggered this awful war, Israel has been subjected to a high level of malicious statements and accusations that have often manifested as incitement to hatred. ""This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous, and the embassy rejects it completely."" The statement added that it is the ""burden of the author to defend its content,  which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region"". The spokesperson referenced the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on concert goers in Israel when about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 40,000 people have been killed in the territory because of Israel's response. A spokesperson for the Irish president's office said: ""The exchange of letters upon the coming to office of a new head of state is standard diplomatic practice for countries which share diplomatic relations. ""As is usual practice, the letter in question was drafted based on material supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and issued via standard diplomatic channels. Such letters have been sent to incoming presidents of Iran for a number of decades. ""In response to questions, the president indicated his view that this standard diplomatic letter had been circulated over the summer and presented as being something out of the ordinary. ""The president made no accusations of a leak, he solely referred to the letter being circulated. In this context, the question of reporting does not arise."" The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris, also at the UN in New York, has defended the Irish president, stating his concerns was the loss of life in Gaza. Harris said that Israel ""is continuing to allow a horrific humanitarian situation continue"". ""I think the Israeli embassy should be focusing on things other than amplifying, circulating or referencing a letter that does really conform with normal diplomatic protocol between heads of state,"" Harris said. ""Certainly, my focus here in New York is not on an exchange of letters, but is on the fact that there is still a horrific, bloody humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the middle east.  ""I have no interest whatsoever in getting into any sort of tit-for-tat or back-or-forth with the Israeli embassy or the government of a country that is continuing to allow this horrific humanitarian situation continue,"" Harris added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg78j4ky5xyo,Africans in Lebanon: ‘Everyone is nervous on campus’,Africans studying in Beirut are having to weigh up whether or not they should leave the country.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:38.587558,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Farai Makamba, a 27-year-old student from Zimbabwe, used to keep his university books on his desk at home in Beirut. Now they’ve been replaced by his passport, travel documents and cash. “I have a plan for myself in case I need to leave urgently,” he says. Mr Makamba, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, returned to Lebanon in September to finish the final year of his master’s degree in mechanical engineering.  He spent the summer holiday at home in Harare. He came back with the hope that the conflict would de-escalate. But since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October last year, there has been near-daily cross-border fire between Israel and Hamas’s ally Hezbollah, the Iran-backed military group which is based in Lebanon. This last week has seen the deadliest days of conflict in Lebanon in almost 20 years.  As many as one million people have been forced from their homes across Lebanon, the country's Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, has said. Israel’s military says it is carrying out a wave of “extensive” strikes in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa area, aiming to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure. The group's leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike on Friday. The week before last, 39 people were killed and thousands wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members exploded across the country. Hezbollah blamed Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied it was behind the attack. The US, UK, Australia, France, Canada and India have all issued official advice for their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. African students have told BBC News they now face a dilemma - whether to remain in Lebanon as Israel continues to attack or return home to countries such as Uganda, Zimbabwe and Cameroon. At the American University of Beirut (AUB), where Mr Makamba is studying, there are around 90 African students on a scholarship programme. Mr Makamba says there has been a “huge jump in fear” among students, especially since the pager and walkie-talkie explosions. “We don’t know who is carrying a ticking time bomb in their pockets,” he says. “Is it your taxi driver? Is it your Uber driver? Is it the person you are walking next to?” Mr Makamba's days used to be filled with classes and seeing friends. Now he says he only leaves the house to go to shop for essentials and the tension is palpable. He recently stocked up on staples such as bread, pasta and bottled water in case of shortages. The campus is closed and several of his classes have been moved online.  “Everyone is nervous. Even the way we communicate is different,” he says. “When we finish class, our professor now says: 'Have a good day and stay safe.' We say the same thing because we know what is happening in the country.” “No-one is safe.” Public schools have also closed and the ministry of education says they are being used to accommodate people who have fled their homes because of the Israeli airstrikes in the south of the country. The scholarship programme funding African students at AUB has given international students the option to go home and finish their course online. But some say that will not be possible. Sharon Atyang, a 27-year-old student from northern Uganda, is currently completing her master’s in community development at AUB. She says electricity and internet issues at home will make it almost impossible to complete her studies online. “I am also on a scholarship, and I don’t know if I travel home that they would bring me back here if the situation stabilises,” she says. Adele Pascaline from Cameroon, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, also says completing her undergraduate radiology degree back home will be almost impossible. “I cannot do my clinical rotations back home, but I need to complete them as part of my degree,” she says. Nevertheless, the continuing attacks have meant she now has a return ticket. The Mastercard Scholarship Program finances dozens of African students in Lebanon. Mastercard Foundation said it is closely monitoring developments and working with AUB to support students. Its spokesperson said: “AUB is regularly communicating with the students and has offered support for their health and well-being.  ""The academic curriculum remains flexible and necessary accommodations have been made to account for the current disruptions and to ensure academic continuity for the enrolled students. International students who wish to return home are supported to do so.” While it is still possible to leave Beirut via the international airport, tickets are difficult to get hold of. Several airlines such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air France and Lufthansa have suspended their flights to and from the city.  Ms Atyang says that from her bedroom in Beirut, she can hear the sounds of the sonic booms caused by Israeli fighter jets flying low over the city. “I was in a reading room and when I heard the sound barrier breaking, I just ran. But I had nowhere to run. I found myself hiding in the toilet,” she says. The stress of waiting for another attack has left her “emotionally and mentally unstable – [unable] to do anything”. She said many students have asked their professors to extend deadlines for assignments. Between trying to study and write her thesis, Ms Atyang is also answering frantic calls from her family in Uganda. “They are demanding that I go back home, they are telling me I need to prioritise my life over academics.” Some African governments have begun evacuations. The Principal Secretary for Diaspora Affairs in Kenya, Roseline Njogu, confirmed that nine Kenyans had arrived back in the country in August. She urged other Kenyans who wished to leave to register for evacuation with the embassy. There are an estimated 26,000 Kenyans currently in Lebanon. Last month, the former spokesperson for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nebiyu Tedla,  told the BBC they were monitoring the situation closely and were “preparing plans to evacuate if necessary”. He added that there were an estimated 150,000 Ethiopians in Lebanon, the vast majority domestic workers. Some of these workers face additional challenges as they work under Lebanon’s strict kafala system, which means they must ask permission from their employers to leave. For students like Mr Makamba and Ms Atyang, getting out of Lebanon might be easier to organise. But they are held back because of their desperation to finish their studies. Both say they will make a decision in the next few days. Ms Atyang says it is particularly hard for African students. “You are on your own, and you have to take care of yourself,” she says.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3lm436jlo,Hezbollah pager explosions highlight shadow war,Israel is suspected of behind a fatal explosion of handheld pagers used by the armed group in Lebanon.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:38.656563,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"If we assume, as virtually all observers do, that Israel was behind Tuesday's astonishing mass pager attack on the ranks of Hezbollah, what does it tell us about what Israel is thinking? In the absence of any official Israeli comment, a certain amount of reading between the lines is needed. One former Israeli intelligence official I contacted explained his reluctance to comment with a saying from the Talmud: “And at this very time the smart ones keep silent.” Given the astonishingly audacious scope of yesterday’s attack, it seems it was designed to cause massive physical, psychological and technical damage to one of Israel’s most formidable opponents. But reports from Lebanon suggest that Israel may not have intended to use this doomsday weapon just now. The “shock and awe” engendered by such an attack was probably being held in reserve for a moment of maximum need: either when Israel was about to launch a major assault on Lebanon or when it felt Hezbollah might be about to act first. Neither of these appear to be the case, lending credence to reports that Israel triggered the explosive pagers because it believed its plot had been, or was in the process of being uncovered. Whatever the truth of the matter, the episode comes at a time when Israel is taking action, overt and covert, to address the threat posed by Hezbollah and its reputed arsenal of 150,000 precision-guided missiles and rockets. Away from the daily air-strikes on Hezbollah targets, each documented for the media by the Israeli military, a murky shadow war is raging. Ten days ago, Israeli special forces mounted an audacious raid against an Iranian-built military facility in Syria, where it’s believed ballistic missiles were being developed. Commandos rappelled from helicopters, planted explosives inside the underground facility and removed sensitive information. Some reports suggested they even captured individuals, possibly Iranian, working there. Six weeks earlier, Israel assassinated Fuad Shukr, one of Hezbollah’s top military commanders. A report in the Wall Street Journal said that just before the attack, Shukr received a message asking him to go to his seventh floor apartment, where he was easier to hit. Hezbollah furiously denied the report, but as yesterday’s dramatic events proved, Hezbollah’s networks – their supply chains and communications – appear to be badly compromised. The Iranian-backed group is, of course, doing its utmost to fight back, firing rockets across Israel’s northern border and, occasionally, trying its own covert operations. On Tuesday morning, Israel said it had foiled an attempt to assassinate a former Israeli security official using a remotely-activated explosive device. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate for Tuesday's mass attack. Given the physical mutilation wrought on huge numbers of its members and the militia’s urgent need to identify and deal with this catastrophic security breach, revenge may have to wait – but it is surely bound to come. Which brings us to a fundamental question: what, if anything, has really changed? Israel’s war with Hezbollah, overt and covert, goes on. Israel’s newly declared war aim – bringing displaced citizens back to evacuated communities along the northern border – has not been advanced. Despite a lot of heated speculation here in Israel, the military does not appear to be poised to invade southern Lebanon. That may eventually happen. Israelis are thoroughly fed up with almost a year of insecurity in the north. But Israel is still fighting in Gaza - the death of four more soldiers was announced on Tuesday - and the prospect of another major ground operation is not universally welcome. An opinion poll by Channel 13 News found that 52% of Israelis favoured a “broad scale war in Lebanon,” with 30% against and 18% undecided. For all Israel’s displays of tactical ingenuity, when it comes to dealing with Hezbollah, it’s hard to see exactly where this simmering conflict is heading next."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglk3d3242o,'I felt my heart was going to stop': At the scene of an IDF strike in Beirut,"An apparent attempted assassination tore through a Beirut tower block, far from Hezbollah's base.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:46.756507,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"In the early hours of Thursday morning, a missile tore through a building in the heart of Beirut, far from where Hezbollah’s presence is strongest in the south. Unlike for many of the other strikes targeting Hezbollah in recent days in Beirut’s southern suburbs, the IDF did not issue an evacuation order in advance. Five members of staff and two volunteer paramedics at a health facility located in the same building were killed, according to the Hezbollah-linked civil defence agency - an emergency response organisation. Nine died in total, according to Lebanese authorities.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike ""targeted terror assets of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation"". BBC News teams went to the scene and tried to piece together what happened. ""I felt that my heart was going to stop - it was pounding very, very loud,” one witness told the BBC. The sound of the missile hitting the 12-storey building was heard across the Lebanese capital and smoke was still drifting into the air the following morning. The building which was targeted is in Bachoura, a largely residential part of the city, and a matter of metres from the Lebanese parliament building. It is more than 4km (2.5 miles) from Dahieh, where Hezbollah has a strong presence and which has been the focus of Israeli strikes in recent weeks - including the one which killed the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah last week. The IDF has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon in the past one and a half weeks in an effort to dismantle Hezbollah’s leadership and ability to launch rockets, missiles and drones into Israel – something the Iran-backed group has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the Gaza war.  Tens of thousands have died in fighting since, mainly Palestinians in Gaza, and dozens of strikes have targeted Beirut in recent days. And in Lebanon more than 2,000 people have died, according to the health ministry. On the second floor of the Bachoura high-rise block, below several apartments, was a medical facility run by the Islamic Health Committee (IHC), which is affiliated with Hezbollah.  The group has a very extensive network of services that spans into supermarkets and schools. It provides medical care to people living in areas with a strong Hezbollah presence, who rely on its centres for treatment, medication and paramedics. The missile hit one of these centres shortly after midnight. Witnesses said the area was busy at the time and as the sound of the explosion rang out, children began to scream. Efforts to clear the rubble were still ongoing when BBC teams arrived at the scene on Thursday morning. Medical equipment like gloves and masks were visible in the wreckage. Hassan Ammar, 82, told the BBC he had been living in the building which was struck for 24 years with his wife and two daughters. He characterised the health service housed in his building as “helping all the Lebanese” and “just like the Red Cross, but an Islamic one"". “When we heard the strike, I ran out of the building with my wife and daughters, our apartment was severely damaged,” he said. “This is a civilian facility - why would they target a civilian facility?” The IDF has not commented on the Bachoura strike but has repeatedly said it does not target civilian infrastructure. The following morning, Amin Sherri - a Hezbollah MP - arrived at the scene thronged by journalists. In 2019, he was designated a financer of terrorism by the US Treasury, which accused him of threatening Lebanese bank officials and their families after it froze the accounts of a Hezbollah member. The US also accused him of having “extensive ties” to Hezbollah financiers, and it released a picture purporting to show Sherri alongside the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ overseas operation arm before he was killed in a US strike in Iraq in 2020.  Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and European Union. On Thursday morning, Sherri held an impromptu news conference at the site of the strike and accused the IDF of deliberately attacking the medical facility. He said: “We will continue this resistance and confrontation, and we will not abandon our responsibilities.” Throughout the morning, there was chaos outside the devastated Bachoura medical centre - and a palpable sense of anger. “As soon as we heard the air raid, we came out of the building running, children were screaming, sometimes you feel your heart is going to stop,” one man said. He insisted the medical centre served many locals and did not have a political or military function. BBC News was unable to get access to the interior of the deserted building. People who lived above the centre said they did not know where they would go tonight. Kamal, a paramedic at the centre, said staffing had recently been increased in light of the fighting. “This is why most of the casualties were medics,” he said. Some of those killed were sleeping when the missile hit, he said. The strike in Bachoura was condemned by the European Union’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who said the IDF had “targeted once again healthcare workers”. He said the strike had killed civilians in a densely populated area, and denied others access to emergency care, before characterising it as a violation of international humanitarian law. On Thursday, the World Health Organization said 28 healthcare workers were killed in the 24 hours previous in Lebanon, and many more “are not reporting to duty” because they had been forced to flee. Israel says it is necessary to take on Hezbollah in order for people in the north of the country to be able to return to their homes. Additional reporting by Sean Seddon and Carine Torbey"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo,Second wave of Lebanon device explosions kills 20 and wounds 450,Walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah blow up a day after pager blasts killed 12 people.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:46.839465,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the country’s health ministry says. Walkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds. Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members’ pagers exploded on Tuesday. Hezbollah blamed Israel for that attack. Israel has not commented. The attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a ""new phase in the war"" and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of the “serious risk of a dramatic escalation” and called on all parties to “exercise maximum restraint”. ""Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation,"" he told reporters. There were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Hours after Wednesday’s explosions, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country “securely to their homes”. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was “opening a new phase in the war” and that the “centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces”. An army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends. An indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech. Hezbollah's media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions.  It also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions. The Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries. It said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon. Wednesday's deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel. Many Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group. Twelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister. A BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT). There was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well. One unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds. The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capital’s southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. The health ministry said the deadly explosions ""targeted walkie-talkies"". A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley. It identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM. NNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. Video footage showed fire damage to a table and wall, as well as damaged parts of what appeared to be a walkie-talkie bearing the label “ICOM”. Photos on social media from two other locations appeared to show the same model. Reuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought. The Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the group’s war-time emergency communications system. The BBC asked ICOM's UK arm to comment on the reports, but it referred all media requests to the company's press office in Japan. The BBC has reached out to ICOM Japan. US and Lebanese sources told the New York Times and Reuters that Israel had planted small amounts of explosives inside the pagers which blew up on Tuesday. An ophthalmologist at one hospital in Beirut told the BBC that at least 60% of the people he had seen had lost at least one eye, with most also losing a hand. “Probably this is the worst day of my life as a physician. I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous,"" Dr Elias Warrak said.  ""Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes - some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y8mlp9jyvo,Cold military logic takes over in Israel-Hezbollah conflict,"Israel’s campaign is a high-risk strategy, in which Hezbollah’s ability to respond cannot be ignored.",23 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:46.939654,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"It seems hard to believe that it’s less than a week since Hezbollah’s communication devices started exploding all across Lebanon. The days since have represented a series of catastrophic setbacks for the formidable, Iranian-backed Shia militia. With its networks disrupted, its fighting men mutilated, its leadership assassinated and its military infrastructure under constant bombardment, Hezbollah is facing its worst crisis in four decades. Now Israel’s defence minister says the campaign is “deepening”. But it’s a high-risk strategy, in which Hezbollah’s ability to respond cannot be ignored. With alerts constantly sounding across northern Israel, Yoav Gallant has told Israelis to “show composure, discipline and full obedience to the directives of Home Front Command”. We found all on display in equal measure when we visited the small community of Givat Avni,  a short distance west of Tiberias. David Yitzhak showed us where a 120mm rocket tore through the roof of his family home at lunchtime on Monday. With sirens blaring, David bundled his wife and six-year-old daughter into the house’s safe room, seconds before the explosion. “It’s a metre from life to death,” David said, indicating the short distance between the safe room and the hole in his daughter’s bedroom. He said he feels no animosity towards the people of Lebanon, but says Hezbollah started the war for no reason. “So now we are giving back. And it will be OK.”  But Givat Avni is 20 miles (30km) from the Lebanese border, far from the evacuation zone established by the authorities almost a year ago. An hour later, as we arrived at nearby Kibbutz Lavi, home for the past year to families evacuated from further north, sirens sounded once more. Rockets appeared in the sky overhead and as we were ushered into an underground shelter full of children and their artwork, we heard a series of deep resonant booms. An hour later, more alerts, another safe room and more distant explosions. Hezbollah had been firing rockets further into Israel, even before the latest escalation. But now an even larger swathe of northern Israel is in the firing line. All of this is adding a sense of urgency to the government’s actions. Speaking after a meeting with defence chiefs, the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was changing the balance of power in the north. “We are facing complex days,” he warned. “We do not wait for a threat,” he said. “We anticipate it. Anywhere, in any arena, at any time. We eliminate senior officials, eliminate terrorists, eliminate missiles.” Having seized the initiative, Israel’s military seems determined to keep Hezbollah on the back foot, in the hope of realising the government’s aim of returning civilians to homes evacuated along the northern border. On Monday morning, it stepped up another gear, telling Lebanese villagers to leave places where they believe Hezbollah is concealing its bigger weapons. Military officials showed journalists a video of an air strike in which Israel says it destroyed a modified Russian cruise missile, hidden inside a house. In another “illustration”, we were shown a skeletal 3D mock-up of a village in southern Lebanon, full of concealed weapons and equipment. The mock-up, and the instructions to civilians to leave, all carried echoes of Israel’s efforts to explain its actions in Gaza. But military officials insist that, unlike Gaza, the warnings do not mean that the army is poised to move in on the ground in southern Lebanon. “We are currently focusing on Israel’s aerial campaign only,” a senior official said on Monday. It seems that for now, Israel will see what it can achieve from the air. A former commander, speaking on Israel’s Channel 12, said that so far, the air force had shown only a fraction of its capabilities. But there’s only so much Israel can achieve from the air, even if, as seems possible, jets are about to lay waste to entire villages. At some point, a ground invasion – however limited – seems unavoidable. But would it be wise? “That’s exactly what Hezbollah wants,” Dr Jacques Neria, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Security and Foreign Affairs, told i24 News. “The residents of southern Lebanon are Hezbollah soldiers,” he said. “And therefore we will have to fight against a mass that we do not know, under unfamiliar conditions.” In his defiant speech last week, Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah dared Israel to attempt to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon, something the head of Israel’s Northern Command is said to be pushing for. Such an effort, he said, would have “dire consequences” for Israel. At the moment, there’s no sign of a diplomatic off-ramp. US-led efforts to defuse the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have run into the sand, along with negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages. Cold military logic – strike and counter-strike – appears to have taken over. This is not a battle of equals. Israel knows it can beat Hezbollah. There’s a complete asymmetry in the level of destruction and suffering that each side can inflict on the other. But where the conflict is heading, and how much worse it will get before it ends, is anyone’s guess."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk7nnr0y06o,'You must leave now' PM tells Britons in Lebanon,"The situation in the Middle East is ""extremely volatile"" and Britons must leave Lebanon now, the prime minister warns.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.037046,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The prime minister has told British nationals in Lebanon they ""must leave now"", following a further escalation in the region as Israel accuses Iran of being behind a missile attack on Tuesday. ""The time is now, do not wait,"" he urged Britons, speaking at a press conference condemning the Iranian attack on Israel at Downing Street. ""I am deeply concerned that the region is on the brink. I'm deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation,"" he said, adding that the situation is ""increasingly grave"". Britons have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website and to try and get on a UK-chartered flight from Beirut back to the Britain.    Earlier on Tuesday, the foreign secretary said British nationals in Lebanon have no guarantee they will be able to leave quickly if the ""febrile and fragile"" situation deteriorates. David Lammy urged Britons to leave the country by commercial flights or on a UK-chartered plane departing on Wednesday, warning the airport in Beirut may close if the fighting continues. But Britons in Lebanon told the BBC they have received no confirmation or details about their booking on the government-chartered flight, despite paying for a seat. ""I have such a heavy heart and I'm so anxious - if I don't get on that flight, there's not really another way back for another two weeks,"" said Hanan Baba, 29. Speaking to the BBC from Tripoli, north Lebanon, Hanan said she originally planned to fly home on 5 October - before Israel hit Lebanon with a fresh wave of airstrikes and announced a ""targeted"" ground operation in the south. ""Ticket prices went through the roof - a budget airline that usually offers a one way trip to the UK at £250 is suddenly £800,"" she said. ""There's nothing else on offer now, apart from very few business class flights costing about £8,000. Or you can bribe someone to take you on a boat to Turkey or Cyprus - for thousands"". On Tuesday Lammy said he was ""seeking more capacity over the coming days"" so that people can return to the UK, but he warned he could not promise all would be swiftly returned. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants in Lebanon. Hanan has paid the requisite £350 for her seat back to the UK on the government-chartered flight, but has received ""no communication"" about the flight time or whether she has a guaranteed seat on the plane. “I feel like the government are covering their backs, deploying troops to Cyprus and saying they are negotiating day and night with flights but we have not seen any of that. They have not even communicated a plan. ""I don't even know which airline the plane is, or what time it's going to leave - and I have to actually get to the airport, which is scary enough. ""There are reports of bombs and missiles landing a five minute drive from the airport"".  Other British nationals have described the ""terrifying"" journey to Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport from various locations in Lebanon. Lara, who did not want to give her surname, 19, told the BBC she had risked her own life to fly back to the UK.  ""I had to convince myself that if I die it's ok - everyone dies at some point. I'd mentally convinced myself that it was ok to be killed by a rocket. ""Whenever I hear a bang, or whenever I hear something being dragged across the floor, I think it's a plane or a missile coming towards me. I shouldn't have to have that trauma - I'm 19."" Lara, who lives in London and is in her second year of university, had been visiting family in Beirut.  She made the journey back with her 84-year-old great-grandmother who had also been on holiday in the Lebanese capital. Lara said she’d received “zero communications, no help” from the UK government, and though she flew with a commercial airline, she said that it had been tough to find a flight that was direct - and affordable.  “The cost is atrocious,” she said.  A British man who works for an international humanitarian organisation and wishes to remain anonymous, evacuated his home in Beirut to Mount Lebanon with his wife and child last week. They are looking for a flight out of Lebanon, but spots are booked for the next two weeks “in every which direction”, with the earliest on 16 or 17 October, and those are business class seats to Madrid or Milan costing thousands, he told the BBC. He said he heard about the chartered flight for British citizens through news reports and has not received any information or offer from the Foreign Office to buy a seat. BBC News told the Foreign Office about British nationals saying they had not received confirmation or communication about the charter flight.  The Foreign Office did not comment.  He added that many people are fearful and under psychological stress because “we don’t know where Israel is going to strike next”. “Everyone outside of the Bekaa Valley and the south and the suburbs of Beirut feels that the war is going to inevitably come to their doorstep,” he said. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his country is facing ""one of its most dangerous phases"", and that one million people are displaced. On Monday Israel said it had launched a ground invasion in southern Lebanon, in what it has described as ""limited, localised and targeted"" raids against Hezbollah. Lebanese civilians are being warned not to use vehicles to travel south across the Litani river, located 20 miles (32km) north of the Israel-Lebanon border, and residents in around 25 villages have been told to evacuate and head north. The previously sporadic cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians.

It suggests Israel would be taking on a better armed adversary than Hamas. But the paper also reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is understood to have given the ""green light"" for discussions on a proposal for a ceasefire in Lebanon. It would be linked to the conflict in Gaza and the release of hostages there. The US is said to be mediating emergency talks, with details being discussed at the UN. The Times reports that ministers are drawing up plans for Texas-style prison reforms in England and Wales which would allow inmates to win points towards reducing their jail time, by taking part in workshops. Prisoners in the US state can shorten the time they serve by earning credits for good behaviour and by going on courses aimed at addressing the underlying causes of offending, such as drug rehabilitation. The policy's understood to have brought down the prison population and the rate of offending in Texas. There are suggestions in the Guardian that the government's plans to crack down on the tax status of non-doms may not raise any extra money for the Treasury. The paper says officials are thought to be worried that the government's spending watchdog believes the policy may be undercut by the fact that so many high-earning non-doms have now left the UK. The Daily Telegraph picks up on Sir Keir Starmer's interview with the BBC in which he says the salary of his chief of staff, Sue Gray, shouldn't be a subject of public debate. It has emerged that she is paid £3,000 more than him. The prime minister said he wouldn't discuss it or the salaries of any individual members of staff.  According to the Guardian, Sir Keir has become dismayed at ""tensions inside the No 10 machine"" because of infighting across government involving Ms Gray. He is said to be under pressure from senior aides and cabinet members to ""get a grip"" on the situation. The Daily Mail says Sir Keir is facing ""mounting questions"" about the use of an £18m penthouse in London briefly lent to him by the Labour donor, Lord Waheed Alli. The prime minister said he had used the flat during the election to help stop his son being distracted from his GCSE studies. But the Mail reports that he has also been accused of using the flat, dressed to look like his home, to record a video during Covid urging the public to work from home. The prime minister's press secretary said no social distancing rules were broken. The Times, Express and Guardian all carry photos of Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates receiving his knighthood at Windsor Castle.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnl2k53glo,"Eurovision failed to support us amid rows, winner says",Swiss singer Nemo says tensions over Israel's participation overshadowed the song contest in May.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:28:47.224826,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Eurovision winner Nemo has said the song contest's organisers didn't do enough to support participants who were caught up in a row over Israel's inclusion in this year's show. ""I felt very alone,"" the Swiss singer, 25, told BBC News. ""I really hope they have things in place for the next year."" Nemo, who has just released their first single since winning the contest in May, added that the event had ""in a way"" been overshadowed by the political controversy. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs Eurovision, said it had introduced changes that would provide ""more clarity and protection"" for artists at future contests. In the build-up to this year's Eurovision, there were calls for Israel to be banned from the competition over the country's military action in Gaza, and pro-Palestinian protests on the streets of Swedish host city Malmö. Some contestants, including Nemo, came under pressure to boycott the show, while Israel's entrant Eden Golan reportedly faced death threats. Nemo, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, has since got a record deal and was speaking to BBC News after their new track, Eurostar, was released. Reflecting on their experiences during Eurovision, Nemo described the atmosphere backstage as ""quite tense"". ""There were situations that are still being investigated by the EBU,"" they said. ""They told us they would get back to us and they haven't yet. It's a shame that the EBU takes so long in my honest opinion."" When asked if the organisers did enough to support contestants at the time, they paused before answering. ""No. I don't think so,"" they said. ""Because I sometimes felt very alone with a lot of things, or at least with the other artists, and it took long for them to get back to artists when they wrote to them."" With global politics remaining febrile, Nemo added: ""I really hope they have things in place for the next year to make sure that part of the whole contest, especially mentally, gets taken care of. ""Because I did feel alone and I know that some other artists were also feeling that way."" In a statement, the EBU said it was ""very mindful"" of the experiences of several artists at this year's contest. ""The process of dealing internally with individual incidents is ongoing and we are determined to ensure all rules are applied fairly and consistently,"" it said. It said an independent consultation had resulted in recommendations, including developing a duty of care protocol for people participating in the contest. ""We believe these will help address many of the issues in Malmö and help everyone, no matter their role, to have a positive and safe experience at the Eurovision Song Contest."" In March, Nemo, the UK's Olly Alexander and seven other Eurovision contestants shared a statement in which they rejected calls to boycott the competition over the Gaza war. Asked why they made the decision to compete, Nemo said they believe the contest fundamentally has good intentions. ""I made friends from all over Europe and I would say I made very meaningful connections with other artists from places I've never been before, listening to music I've never heard before, getting to know people that are different to you. Always I think that's a very good thing,"" they said. ""At the core of this contest, I think it's an exchange of different cultures and coming together and I really believe in that sentiment."" This year's Eurovision was more fraught than usual.  Israel, which has taken part in the contest since 1973, had to change the lyrics of its entry after the original version broke rules on political neutrality because it was thought to reference the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. At the event, there were backstage tensions between the Israeli delegation and some other countries, which Israel later said amounted to ""an unprecedented display of hatred"". Meanwhile, during the semi-finals, former Swedish winner Eric Saade performed in the half-time slot with a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf wrapped around his wrist. And in the build-up to the grand final, Ireland's contestant withdrew from a dress rehearsal after complaining about Israeli TV of coverage of their performance; and France's singer broke with protocol in the dress rehearsal by interrupting his song to make an impassioned speech about peace. Separately, the Dutch entry was disqualified because of an alleged confrontation with a female camera operator. Although the rows did partly overshadow their win, Nemo added that they stayed focused on telling their story, ""because it was - and I'm still convinced it is - an important story to tell"". ""Knowing that it had an impact, and a lot of people found something in that, and a lot of people gained something from that, especially young queer people, that makes me really happy."" Nemo, who was 24 at the time of the contest, became the first non-binary artist to win Eurovision. Fittingly, they wrote the winning song, The Code, to explain how they came to terms with their identity. The victory represented a big moment for the LGBTQ community which has, for a long time, treated Eurovision as a safe haven. ""It was only right after Eurovision that I started to realise the scale of what this moment meant to a lot of people,"" Nemo said. They said their win sparked a wider discussion in their own home country, including around offering a third gender option on passports - something Switzerland has so far resisted. But they also felt the win gave ""a lot of queer people hope and feeling understood and finally seen"". ""I didn't grow up with a non-binary person to look up to. I think we've recently had these role models come up,"" they added. ""I'm really grateful even to be a part of this moment in time."" Nemo, who grew up in Switzerland, has been living in Berlin for the past few years and recently moved to London. They said the inspiration for their new single, Eurostar, came as they took the train from Paris to the UK capital in July. ""At that time, I was in the craziest phase of post-Eurovision madness, that was every day [having] no sleep, going to the next stop, and I felt the train incorporated all of that."" ""I wanna dance, I wanna party, do it likе no one before,"" Nemo sings on a track that is all about living life in the moment and getting carried away in the music. They said the song was also a metaphor for their arrival in London, a city they described as ""inspiring"". Nemo described the experience of Eurovision as one of ""crazy ups and downs"". ""I was a Swiss-based artist that a few people from Switzerland knew and suddenly you have eyes all around you from all around the world,"" they said. For now, they're focusing on making music and enjoying the moment. But can they turn their victory into lasting fame? Some Eurovision winners clearly have - such as Swedish pop band Abba and Italian band Måneskin. Most, however, do not. ""I don't know if my goal is to become Abba,"" they said. ""I think the goal for me is to find my own voice."" As for the UK's own Eurovision hopes, after Alexander received the dreaded 'nul points' from the public this year, Nemo has the following advice. ""I would say to any artist that's thinking of going to Eurovision, I would just do it, and I believe Olly really did that,"" they said. ""Do it if you feel like you're going to enjoy it, and you're going to enjoy it no matter what the result is."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05g0q3nvz6o,Family of Scottish Hamas victim are 'missing a great man',"The sister of Bernard Cowan hopes peace will come to the Middle East, one year after his murder.",7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:28:47.316998,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The sister of a Scottish victim of the Hamas attack on Israel a year ago has spoken of the ""thorn in her heart"" caused by his death. Bernard Cowan was one of 1,200 victims of the 7 October assault. He was shot dead outside the home he shared with his family on Kibbutz Sufa. His sister, Laura Schosloff, has told the BBC their family is ""broken"" by his death and they are ""missing a great man"". And she expressed the hope that Israelis, Palestinians and the Lebanese would be able to live in harmony. Mr Cowan, who was 57 when he died, grew up in Newton Mearns, attending Netherlee primary school and Mearns Castle high school. He moved to Israel when he was 17 and served with the military on Kibbitz Sufa, where he met his wife, Margaret. He had a life of ""freedom"" on the kibbutz, Ms Schosloff said, regularly gardening, scuba diving and travelling. On the day of the attack, he was at his home with his wife when Hamas gunmen arrived, armed with machine guns and missile launchers. Ms Schosloff told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Bernard loved his life. ""There's a big thorn in my heart today about what's happened. ""He had such a passion for life but he was so content with his life. He just had a wonderful life."" Ms Schosloff said she was wary in the period after the attack but has spent the past year speaking to people she has met in her work and private life. ""The people I've met, I've told everybody what happened to Bernard because it's so important that everybody knows the human face from it. It's one of our own. ""I love being Scottish. I mean I'm Scottish, British and Jewish and I'm proud of everything. And I love the Scottish people. I haven't had any bad feelings towards me."" She said she prays for peace in the region, which has been engulfed in fighting since the 7 October attack. ""I would love there to be peace but not just the Israelis. The Palestinians, the Lebanese, I would love there to be peace. ""I want people to be able to go into their own homes; 80,000 Israelis are displaced at the moment. My friends and family are displaced as well as the Palestinians and Lebanese. ""I want them to be able to go to their own homes, be able to bring their children up, be able to get jobs and to be able to live in harmony with their neighbours."" Following Bernard's death, Ms Schosloff said the close Jewish community in Glasgow mourned his loss together. ""The Jewish community in Glasgow is like a village within a city. Everybody knows everybody else. Our community had lost one of their own and everybody was grieving as well for Bernard. ""It’s one of your own. It’s a boy from Glasgow and a boy who was proud to be Glaswegian."" One year on, Ms Schosloff said she keeps Bernard's memory alive by sharing stories about him and remembering the good times. The family recently planted a tree in the Jewish cemetery in his memory, paying tribute to his love of gardening. She said: ""It’s important we talk and remember their memories and they’ll never be forgotten.  ""Bernard will never be forgotten, he will always be a part of my heart."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnelvpepo,Hezbollah blames Israel after pager explosions kill nine and injure thousands in Lebanon,"Nine people have been killed and 2,800 wounded by the blasts, the Lebanese health ministry says.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.422273,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Nine people, including a child, have been killed after handheld pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah to communicate exploded across Lebanon, the country’s health minister says. Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among 2,800 other people who were wounded by the simultaneous blasts in Beirut and several other regions. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said the pagers belonged “to employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions” and confirmed the deaths of eight fighters. The group blamed Israel for what it called “this criminal aggression” and vowed that it would get “just retribution”. The Israeli military declined to comment. Hours before the explosions, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah attacks on the north of the country to allow the safe return of displaced residents was an official war goal.  There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Iran-backed Palestinian group.  In its latest statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah said it would carry on its ""operations in support of Gaza"", adding that this was a “continuous path separate from the hard price that awaits the enemy in response to its massacre on Tuesday”. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. The UN's spokesman said the latest developments in Lebanon were ""extremely concerning, especially given that this is taking place within a context that is extremely volatile"". Many Lebanese were in a state of shock and disbelief on Tuesday evening, unable to get their heads around an event that was unprecedented in scale and nature. Hezbollah said an unspecified number of pagers - which the group relies on heavily for communications due to the risk of mobile phones being hacked or tracked - exploded at around 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) in the capital Beirut and many other areas. One CCTV video showed an explosion in a man’s bag or pocket at a supermarket. He is then seen falling backwards to the ground and crying out in pain as other shoppers run for cover. Hours later, ambulances were still rushing to hospitals overwhelmed with the number of casualties, 200 of whom the health minister said were in a critical condition. Outside, relatives were waiting in the hope of receiving updates. The LAU Medical Centre in Beirut's Ashrafieh district closed its main gate and was limiting the number of people getting in. “It’s very sensitive and some scenes are horrific,” one staff member told the BBC. Most of the wounds were at the level of the waist, face, eyes and hands, he said, adding: “A lot of casualties have lost fingers, in some cases all of them.” The wife of Iranian ambassador Mojtaba Amani said he was ""slightly injured"" by one of the explosions and that he was ""doing well"" in hospital. Hezbollah's media office announced the deaths of eight fighters. It did not give details on the locations and circumstances, saying only that they were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem"". A source close to the group told AFP news agency that the son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar and the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member in the Bekaa Valley were among those killed. Later, the source said the son of another lawmaker, Hassan Fadlallah, was wounded, having initially reported that he was dead. Fourteen people were also wounded by exploding pagers in neighbouring Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting alongside government forces in the country's civil war, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,” Hezbollah said in a statement on Tuesday evening. “This treacherous and criminal enemy will certainly get his just retribution on this sinful aggression from where it counts and from where it does not count,” it added. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati also blamed Israel for the explosions, saying that they represented a “serious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards”. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he told his Lebanese counterpart that he ""strongly condemned Israeli terrorism"". The US, Israel's closest ally, denied any involvement and urged Iran not to heighten tensions. Hezbollah did not say what it believed had caused the pagers to explode. The Wall Street Journal cited a source as saying the affected devices were from a new shipment that Hezbollah had received in recent days. A Hezbollah official also told the newspaper some people had felt the pagers heat up before the blasts. Overheated lithium-ion batteries can catch fire, but experts said hacking into the pagers and making them overheat would not usually cause such explosions. A former British Army munitions expert, who asked not to be named, told the BBC the pagers would have likely been packed with between 10g and 20g of military-grade high explosive, hidden inside a fake electronic component.  Once armed by a signal, called an alphanumeric text message, the next person to use the device would have triggered the explosive, the expert said. Lina Khatib, a Middle East analyst at the UK-based Chatham House think tank, told the BBC: ""Israel has been engaging in cyber operations against Hezbollah for several months, but this security breach is the largest in scale.” Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based senior fellow of the American think tank the Atlantic Council, said: “Israel in one fell swoop has rendered combat ineffective hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah fighters, in some cases permanently.” He warned that Hezbollah's leaders would now “face extreme pressure from the ranks and supporters to retaliate heavily”, describing it as ""the most dangerous moment"" in the Hezbollah-Israel conflict since October. A statement put out by the Israeli military on Tuesday evening did not comment on the pager explosions, but said the chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi had held a situational assessment with commanders ""focusing on readiness in both offence and defence in all arenas"". It also said there was no change in defensive guidelines to the Israeli public but asked them to remain alert and vigilant. Earlier in the day, the military said an air strike had killed three “Hezbollah terrorists operating within a terrorist infrastructure site” in the Blida area, near Lebanon’s border with Israel. Lebanon’s health ministry confirmed that three people had been killed in an Israeli strike, while Hezbollah’s media office said it had carried out missile and drone attacks targeting Israeli troops and military sites. Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service also said it had foiled a Hezbollah bomb attack targeting an unnamed former senior Israeli security official. Hezbollah did not comment on the accusation. This comes at a time when Israel's government is threatening to step up its military effort against Hezbollah. On Tuesday morning, Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of 60,000 residents displaced in the north by Hezbollah attacks an official goal of the Gaza war. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said during a meeting with US envoy Amos Hochstein on Monday that the only way to return northern residents was through ""military action"". “The possibility for an agreement is running out as Hezbollah continues to ‘tie itself’ to Hamas, and refuses to end the conflict,” a statement from his office said. Since the hostilities escalated in October, at least 589 people have been killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, according to the Lebanese health ministry.  On the Israeli side, 25 civilians and 21 members of security forces have been killed, the Israeli government says. Additional reporting by Frances Mao"

Dima Hamdan said she was ""deeply honoured"" to receive the £30,000 2024 Iris Prize, because it was both ""the 'Oscars' of the LGBTQ+ short film world"" and ""it comes from a community that has increasingly voiced its support for Palestine in recent years"". Former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, who chaired the international jury, called Blood Like Water ""an important reminder that queer people exist everywhere, including in Palestine at a time of war and occupation"". Louisa Connolly-Burnham won the Best British Short at the Cardiff-based festival for her work, Sister Wives. Hamdan is a self-taught filmmaker and journalist based in Berlin. According to the festival, her film ""tells the story of Shadi, who embarks on a secret adventure and accidentally drags his family into a trap where they only have two choices; collaborate with the Israeli occupation or be shamed and humiliated by their own people"". Reacting to the prize, Hamdan said: ""It is difficult to celebrate personal achievements when the most televised and live-streamed war in human history has dragged on for one year with no end in sight. “In order to survive these dark times, I find strength by envisioning a future when all of this will be over. ""In that vision, I take solace knowing that the Iris Film Prize, its wonderful team and the jury will hold a special place in my heart for standing with us and helping to amplify our voices."" Festival director Berwyn Rowlands said he was proud that the event shared ""stories not necessarily covered by the mainstream"".  He added: ""This year the filmmakers have focused on the more serious aspect of LGBTQ+ life. Although many are dark there is still hope."" Connolly-Burnham, who is from Birmingham, wrote, directed, produced and co-starred in her film. Sister Wives is described as a ""multi-layered love story that tells the tale of young women living in a strict, fundamentalist, polygamous society in 2003 Utah, USA"".  Tim Highsted, who chaired the jury for the Best British Short, called it a ""beautifully nuanced and performed drama about two women rebelling against their community’s social and religious constraints and finding love for each other"". Channel 4 will stream all 15 films shortlisted in the Best British Shorts category for a year after the festival."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw5rqzz5jjo,Pager explosions will devastate Hezbollah's morale and manpower,"Tuesday's blasts, which Hezbollah blames on Israel, look calculated to sow fear and confusion.",17 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:56.343120,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"It is hard to think of an attack more calculated to sow fear and confusion. Hezbollah relies heavily on pagers for the group’s communications. Mobile phones have long since been abandoned as simply too vulnerable - as Israel’s assassination of a Hamas bombmaker demonstrated as long ago as 1996. But today’s attacks were terrifying in their scope. Hezbollah members were blown up in supermarkets, on the street, in their cars, at home, next to their children. Incidents were reported from all across Lebanon, from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley. Even from neighbouring Syria. Iranian state TV confirmed that Tehran’s ambassador in Lebanon was among those injured. Each explosion may have been small, but some resulted in catastrophic injuries. One particularly graphic image showed a lifeless young man slumped in a barber’s chair, his face bloodied. At a time when Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in a low-level war for almost a year, these attacks will have devastating consequences for Hezbollah’s manpower, communications and morale. Israel has yet to comment, but this was undoubtedly its work - no other group or country has the motivation or capacity to do something like this. It is the latest in a series of sophisticated military and undercover operations that have included, since mid-July, a long-range air raid in Yemen, as well as assassinations in Beirut and Tehran. Do the pager attacks herald a larger Israeli operation? With large numbers of Hezbollah's personnel now injured and its vital communication network massively - and embarrassingly - disrupted, this would clearly be a tempting moment for Israel to take advantage. Israeli leaders have been signalling, in recent days, their desire to alter the military status quo along the Lebanese border. On Sunday, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel needed “a change in the balance of power on our northern border"". Tens of thousands of Israeli citizens have spent most of a year away from their homes. Israel ordered an evacuation of vulnerable northern communities when Hezbollah started firing rockets into northern Israel, soon after the Gaza war began. Months of retaliatory Israeli air strikes have also forced huge numbers of Lebanese civilians to abandon their homes. On Monday, Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, both warned a visiting US official that Israel was prepared to do whatever it took to ensure its security. For the first time, the government also said its Gaza war aims included allowing Israelis to return to their homes, raising the spectre of a wider conflict, possibly involving a limited ground invasion to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. There are no signs yet of the sort of build up of men and armour that would be needed for a major military incursion, but today’s attacks represent yet another dangerous escalation. It is hard to see how Hezbollah won’t feel compelled to respond in some way."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5y23qgx0qo,Japanese atomic bomb survivors win Nobel Peace Prize,"Nihon Hidankyo, a group of survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is recognised for its work to rid the world of nuclear weapons.",3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:28:56.444073,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese group of atomic bomb survivors, has won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. Known as hibakusha, the survivors of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been recognised by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Nobel Committee Chair Joergen Watne Frydnes said the group had ""contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo"". Mr Frydnes warned the ""nuclear taboo"" was now ""under pressure"" - and praised the group's use of witness testimony to ensure nuclear weapons must never be used again. Founded in 1956, the organisation sends survivors around the world to share their testimonies of the ""atrocious damage"" and suffering caused by the use of nuclear weapons, according to its website. Their work began almost a decade after the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 6 August 1945, a US bomber dropped the uranium bomb above the city of Hiroshima, killing around 140,000 people. Three days later a second nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan's surrender, announced by Emperor Hirohito shortly afterwards, ended World War Two. Speaking to reporters in Japan, a tearful Toshiyuki Mimaki, the co-head of the group, said: ""Never did I dream this could happen,"" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. Mr Mimaki criticised the idea that nuclear weapons bring peace. ""It has been said that because of nuclear weapons, the world maintains peace. But nuclear weapons can be used by terrorists,"" Mr Mimaki said, according to reports by AFP. In a BBC interview last year, he said despite only being three years old at the time the nuclear bomb hit Hiroshima - he could still remember dazed and burnt survivors fleeing past his home. The prize - which consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a sum of $1m (£765,800) - will be presented at a ceremonies in Oslo in December, marking the anniversary of the death of the scientist and prize creator Alfred Nobel. The group has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize ""many times"" in the past, including in 2005 when it received a special mention by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, its website says. The decision to recognise Nihon Hidankyo means the Nobel committee has steered away from more controversial nominees for the peace prize. There had been widespread speculation the United Nations agency supporting Palestinians – UNRWA – was being considered for the prize.  Although the organisation is the main provider of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, nine of its members were fired for alleged involvement in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 last year.  More than 12,000 people had signed a petition urging the committee not to award UNRWA the prize.  There were equal concerns about the nomination of the International Court of Justice.  The UN’s main judicial organ is currently considering allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and has already issued a statement urging the Israeli authorities to refrain from genocidal acts. But while giving the prize to Nihon Hidankyo may be a non-controversial choice, it could also focus global attention on the threat of nuclear conflict which overshadows the fighting in both Ukraine and the Middle East.  Throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its leaders have repeatedly hinted that they may be ready to use tactical nuclear weapons if western allies increase their support for Ukraine in a way Russia considers unacceptable. These threats have succeeded in restraining western support for fear of escalation.  In the Middle East, the subtext for much of Israel’s strategy is the fear that Iran is seeking nuclear capability, something Tehran denies.  The Nobel committee’s decision may renew a debate about the use of nuclear weapons at a time when some countries look enviously at their deterring power. This year's peace prize had 286 nominations, a number comprising 197 individuals and 89 organisations. Nominations can be made by people in positions of significant authority, including members of national assemblies, governments and international courts of law. Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi won the prize in 2023, when she was honoured for her work fighting the oppression of women in Iran. Ms Mohammadi is currently being held in Evin prison in Tehran, having already spent 12 years in jail serving multiple sentences related to her activism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2kn10xxldo,Death toll from Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon rises to 12,Lebanon’s health minister said two children and several healthcare workers were among the dead.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:56.541135,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Lebanon’s health minister says the number of people killed when pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah exploded on Tuesday has risen to 12, including two children and four healthcare workers. Firas Abiad told a news conference that almost two-thirds of the 2,800 wounded people needed some form of surgery to their face, eyes or hands, and that many had suffered amputations. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, blamed Israel for the attack and warned that it would face a “severe reckoning”. While Israel declined to comment, media reports cited US and Lebanese sources as saying Israeli operatives had hidden small amounts of explosives inside recently imported pagers. The UN, US and UK have appealed for calm and restraint, amid fears of an all-out war. Israel’s leaders have said they are ready to step up military action to return tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country to their homes after 11 months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends. Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting Hospitals across Lebanon were overwhelmed by casualties on Tuesday afternoon, after thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah blew up almost simultaneously in shops, homes, and cars, and on streets. Tracy Chamoun, a Lebanese writer, politician and former ambassador to Jordan, told the BBC the aftermath of Tuesday’s explosions was “horrifying”. She had been travelling in a car along a flyover in Beirut’s southern suburbs - a stronghold of Hezbollah - when she suddenly saw people lying on a road below. “All hell broke loose as they started to scramble to take these people to hospital. The cars were just pushed aside as motorbikes and cars came through with people covered in blood,” she said. “One of the injured men who I saw had his eye blown out. Another one had half of his face ripped off.” Hezbollah has provided no details about what happened, but it is known that the group has long relied on pagers for communications due to concerns among its leaders about mobile phones being hacked or tracked by Israeli security forces. Ms Chamoun said the pagers had “emitted a sound before being detonated to encourage people to take them out of their pockets or from their desks and lift them to their heads”. US and Lebanese sources told the New York Times and Reuters news agency that Israel planted small amounts of explosives inside at least 3,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah this year from a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Gold Apollo. ""The Mossad injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code. It's very hard to detect it through any means,"" one Lebanese security source told Reuters. Gold Apollo’s founder denied it had anything to do with the blasts and said it had signed an agreement with another company based in Budapest, BAC Consulting, to manufacturer the devices and use its name. The BBC has attempted to reach BAC. Axios meanwhile cited US officials as saying that Israel had decided to blow up the pagers “out of concern its secret operation might have been discovered”. ""It was a use it or lose it moment,"" one official was quoted as describing the timing. Lebanon’s health minister said an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy were among the dead, as well as several healthcare workers from Dahiyeh, in southern Beirut, who had been using pagers. Of the 2,800 people who were wounded, about 750 were in the south of Lebanon, 150 in the Bekaa Valley, and about 1,850 in the capital and its suburbs, he added. Mr Abiad said a large number of patients were in intensive care, some due to injuries affecting their ability to breathe. Others had injuries related to bleeding, including brain haemorrhages. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured by one of the blasts, but his family and Iranian officials said he was in a ""good and stable condition"". In an interview with the BBC, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital in Beirut said the past 24 hours there had been “a nightmare”. “Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes,"" Dr Elias Warrak said, adding that more than 60 to 70% of the patients ended up with at least one eye removed. “Some of the patients, we had to remove both eyes. It kills me. In my past 25 years in practice, I’ve never removed as many eyes as I did yesterday.” Hezbollah has announced the deaths of 12 fighters since Tuesday afternoon, including the son of the Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar. However, it has not given details on the locations and circumstances, saying only that they were “martyred on the road to Jerusalem"" - a phrase it has been using to refer to fighters killed by Israel. The only death the group directly attributed to a pager explosion was an employee of the al-Rassoul Al-Aazam Hospital in southern Beirut. Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue operations ""in support of Gaza"" and ""defend Lebanon"". “This path is ongoing and separate from the severe reckoning that the criminal enemy must face for the massacre it committed on Tuesday against our people, our families, and our fighters in Lebanon,” it added. The UN Special Co-ordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned of “an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context”. She urged all parties to “refrain from any further action, or bellicose rhetoric, which could trigger a wider conflagration that nobody can afford”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken denied that his country - Israel’s closest ally - had known about or been involved in the explosions. Negotiating a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas would be the best way to reduce regional tensions, he said at a news conference with his Egyptian counterpart in Cairo. “We remain very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve in Gaza to see it spread to other fronts,” he added. Israel has yet to respond to any claims. However, the Israeli military quoted the head of its Northern Command, MG Ori Gordin, as saying forces were ""determined to change the security reality as soon as possible"" along the border with Lebanon."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c781d8y397do,'We don’t know if our phones are safe': Lebanon on edge after exploding device attacks,"A second wave of communication device explosions killed at least 20 people, Lebanese officials say.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:56.641987,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Just as crowds had gathered to mourn some of those killed in Tuesday’s wave of pager-bomb attacks, an explosion sparked chaos in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut.  In the surrounding area there was bedlam as the sound of the explosion echoed through the streets. The chants stopped. Those gathered looked at each other, some incredulous.  As reports spread that this was part of a second wave of explosions now targeting walkie-talkies, no electronic equipment was considered safe.  In Dahiyeh, Hezbollah supporters stopped our team several times, demanding we did not use our phones or our camera. One of our producers received a message from a friend, who said she had changed her Lebanese SIM card to an international number, concerned that her phone could explode, too.  Many people here, and across the country, are inevitably wondering what will come next. Some even say they do not know if it is safe to walk next to other people, and are changing their plans. ""Everyone is just panicking… We don’t know if we can stay next to our laptops, our phones. Everything seems like a danger at this point, and no one knows what to do,” one woman, Ghida, said. The confusion was made worse by rumours that spread on social media. One of them suggested that even solar panels were blowing up. ""A state of panic overwhelmed people,” another woman said. “And frankly, this situation is very frightening”. Wednesday’s attack, which killed 25 people, came as the country was still shocked and angered by what happened the day before, when thousands of pagers exploded in a synchronised attack, after users received a message they believed had come from Hezbollah. The devices detonated as people were in shops, or with their families at home, killing 12, including an eight-year-old girl who went to pick up the pager for her father, and an 11-year-old boy. Around 2,800 others were wounded, with hundreds needing surgery. Treating some of the injured, Dr Elias Warrak said at least 60% of the people he had seen after Tuesday's blasts had lost at least one eye, with many also losing a finger or a whole hand. He described it as ""the worst day of [his] life as a physician"". ""I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes – some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage."" The attacks are a humiliation for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, and a possible indication that its entire communication network may have been infiltrated by Israel, the worst security breach in the group’s history. Reports suggest a shipment of pagers may have been rigged with explosives, before being detonated remotely. Hezbollah had distributed the devices amid concerns that smartphones were being used by the Israeli military and intelligence agencies to track down and kill its members. It was still not clear how Wednesday’s attacks might have been carried out. “The pain is huge, physical and in the heart. But this is something we are used to, and we will continue with our resistance,"" said a young man in Dahiyeh. A woman said: ""This will make us stronger, whoever has lost an eye will fight with the other eye and we are all standing together.” Hezbollah has vowed to respond, blaming Israel for the attacks. As usual, Israel has not commented. Fears are, again, rising that the current violence between the two rivals, which has led to the displacement of tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border, could escalate into an all-out war. Hezbollah says its attacks on Israel, which started almost a year ago, are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and that they will only stop with a ceasefire, an elusive possibility for now. Hours after the latest explosions, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country was ""at the start of a new phase in the war"", as the 98th division of the Israeli army relocated from Gaza to the north of Israel. Up until now, Hezbollah has indicated that it is not interested in another major war with Israel, as Lebanon struggles to recover from a years-long economic crisis. Many here say a conflict is not in the country’s interests. A damaged Hezbollah is not in Iran’s interests either, as the group acts as part of the country’s deterrence against Israel. But some will certainly demand a strong response. An indication of what Hezbollah might be planning to do could come on Thursday, in the first public reaction by its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04m913m49o,What we know about the Hezbollah device explosions,"The attacks left at least 32 dead and thousands injured, but how the blasts occurred remains unclear.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:56.735766,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured, many seriously, after communication devices, some used by the armed group Hezbollah, dramatically exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the latest round of blasts on Wednesday, exploding walkie-talkies killed 20 and injured at least 450 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry. The explosions occurred in the vicinity of a large crowd that had gathered for the funerals of four victims of Tuesday's simultaneous pager blasts, which killed at least 12 people and injured nearly 3,000. BBC teams in the city reported chaotic scenes in which ambulances struggled to reach the injured, while locals became suspicious of anyone using a phone. The explosions deepened unease in Lebanese society, coming a day after the apparently similar and highly sophisticated attack targeting thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members. The militant group blamed its adversary, Israel. Israeli officials have so far declined to comment.  Two firms based in Taiwan and Hungary accused in media reports of manufacturing the pagers have both denied responsibility, with the Taiwanese government saying the different parts of the pagers were not from Taiwan. ""The components are low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries, I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan,"" Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said.   A Japanese company which apparently makes the walkie-talkies said it stopped producing that model 10 years ago. Here is what we know so far.  The first round of blasts began in Lebanon's capital Beirut and several other areas of the country at about 15:30 local time (13:30 BST) on Tuesday. Witnesses reported seeing smoke coming from people's pockets, before seeing small explosions that sounded like fireworks and gunshots.  Citing US officials, the New York Times said that the pagers received messages that appeared to be coming from Hezbollah's leadership before detonating. The messages instead appeared to trigger the devices, the outlet reported.  Explosions continued for around an hour after the initial blasts, the Reuters news agency reported. Soon after, scores of people began arriving at hospitals across Lebanon, with witnesses reporting mass confusion in emergency departments. Similar scenes played out across the country in another round of blasts on Wednesday, at around 17:00 local time (15:00 BST). Reports suggest it was walkie-talkies that were blown up, devices that were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, according to a security source speaking to Reuters news agency. At least one explosion was close to a funeral being held in Beirut for some of the victims of Tuesday's attack, creating panic among those near the procession. Twenty people have been killed and at least 450 injured, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Details about the walkie-talkies detonated in Wednesday's explosions are still coming to light.  Footage shot in the aftermath showed destroyed devices bearing the brand Icom, a Japanese company. A statement from the firm describes the IC-V82 model as a handheld radio which was exported to the Middle East from 2004 to 2014 and has not been shipped since then.  Icom said production on that model stopped 10 years ago. The manufacturing of the batteries has also stopped, it says. The company says it is not possible to confirm whether the IC-V82s that exploded in yesterday's attacks were shipped directly from Icom, or via a distributor. It said any products for overseas markets were sold only to the firm’s authorised distributors. But the models may not even be from Icom. Earlier, a sales executive at the US subsidiary of Icom told AP news agency that the devices which exploded in Lebanon appeared to be a knock-off product – adding it was easy to find counterfeit versions of the product online. The pagers that exploded on Tuesday were a new brand that the group had not used before, one Hezbollah operative told AP. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that around 5,000 pagers were brought into the country about five months ago.    Labels seen on fragments of exploded pagers point to a pager model called the Rugged Pager AR-924. But its Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo has denied any involvement with the explosions. When the BBC visited Gold Apollo on Wednesday local police were searching the company's offices, inspecting documents and questioning staff.  The founder, Hsu Ching-Kuang, said his company had signed an agreement with a Hungarian-based company - BAC - to manufacture the devices and use his company's name. He added that money transfers from them had been ""very strange"", without elaborating.  BBC Verify has accessed BAC’s company records, which reveal it was first incorporated in 2022. Its CEO Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono told NBC that she knew nothing about the explosions. “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong,"" she said. The Hungarian government said the company had ""no manufacturing or operational site"" in the country. Unnamed US and Israeli officials told Axios that detonating the pagers all at once was initially planned as the opening move in an ""all-out"" offensive against Hezbollah. But in recent days Israel became concerned Hezbollah had become aware of the plan - so they were set off early. Israeli officials have not commented on the allegations, but most analysts agree that it seems likely it is behind the attack.  Prof Simon Mabon, chair in International Relations at Lancaster University, told the BBC: ""We know that Israel has a precedent of using technology to track its target"" - but he called the scale of this attack ""unprecedented"".  Lina Khatib, from the UK-based Chatham House, said the attack suggested that Israel has ""deeply"" infiltrated Hezbollah's ""communications network"". In its statement accusing Israel of being behind the attacks, Hezbollah said it held the country ""fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians"". Hezbollah has relied heavily on pagers as a low-tech means of communications to try to evade location-tracking by Israel. Pagers are wireless telecommunications devices that receive and display alphanumeric or voice messages.  They are much harder to track than mobile phones, which have long since been abandoned as simply too vulnerable, as Israel’s assassination of the Hamas bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash demonstrated as long ago as 1996, when his phone exploded in his hand. In February, Hassan Nasrallah directed Hezbollah fighters to get rid of their phones, saying they had been infiltrated by Israeli intelligence. He told his forces to break, bury or lock their phones in an iron box.  Experts now say the directive, issued during a live televised address, may have forewarned Israeli intelligence operatives that the group would be seeking a new - likely lower tech - method of communications.  A source close to Hezbollah told AFP news agency that two of those killed in Tuesday's attack were the sons of two Hezbollah MPs. They also said the daughter of a Hezbollah member was killed. Among the injured was Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. Reports in Iranian media said his injuries were minor.  Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was not hurt in the explosions, Reuters reported quoting a source. Lebanese Public Health Minister Firass Abiad said damage to the hands and face made up the majority of injuries. The victims presenting to emergency rooms were a variety of ages, from the old to the very young, some wearing civilian clothes, he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Outside of Lebanon, 14 people were injured in similar blasts in neighbouring Syria, according to UK-based campaign group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Hezbollah is allied with Israel's arch-nemesis in the region, Iran. The group is part of Tehran's Axis of Resistance and has been engaged in a low-level war with Israel for months, frequently exchanging rocket and missile fire across Israel's northern border. Entire communities have been displaced from both sides.  The blasts came just hours after Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of residents to the north of the country an official war goal. While visiting an Israeli airbase on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the country was ""opening a new phase in the war"" and and the ""centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces"". Despite the ongoing tensions, observers say that until now both sides have aimed to contain hostilities without crossing the line into full-scale war. But there are fears that the situation could spiral out of control. Additional reporting by Frances Mao"

Its columnist, Patrick Cockburn, suggests Benjamin Netanyahu is probably ""igniting a fire in the region that will never go out"".  The Guardian says the apparent attempt to kill the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, even if he wasn't harmed, ""marks a staggering escalation on the Israeli side"". Its analysis online also calls it ""an emphatic slap in the face"" for the Biden administration and its efforts to secure a temporary truce.  Commentary in the Financial Times suggests ""US diplomacy appears adrift and impotent"".  The Daily Telegraph describes targeting Hezbollah's secretary-general as ""a gamble extraordinaire,""  challenging Tehran to hit back. The broadsheet says Iran will be mulling over whether a US-led coalition will come together again to shoot down a counter-attack as it did in April. According to The Times , there are proposals to increase the cap on university fees by 13.5 per cent over the next five years to £10,500. A Whitehall source says there are ""live discussions"" between ministers, but that any final decision would need to be approved by the chancellor. Boris Johnson's memoir, Unleashed, which is being serialised in the Daily Mail, reveals how the former prime minister initially ignored doctors' advice to go to hospital, despite being so ill with Covid that he couldn't read, face any food or in his words ""barely think"".  He describes trying to avoid sleeping in the intensive care unit in case he ""never woke up"". Without the two nurses there, he writes he fears he ""might have carked it"".  Most front pages carry tributes to Dame Maggie Smith, described by the Daily Mirror as ""a true legend"" and by The Sun as ""Magnificent Maggie."" The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw said she was the ""grandest of grandes dames."" While writing in the Daily Express, the theatre critic, Neil Norman calls her ""a world class performer whose appeal crossed generations"". Elsewhere, the Financial Times reports that Germany and France are calling for an urgent rethink of plans to roll out the EU's biometric border on the tenth of November.  They say the main computer system won't be able to cope with the new entry exit system that will require all non-EU citizens, including British visitors, to register their personal details, including their fingerprints.  The European Commission said it was in close contact with member states who were working hard to ensure the system could start on time. And The Times considers research suggesting that receiving a Michelin star may be ""more of a curse than a blessing"" for a restaurant. A study of highly rated venues in New York found those with Michelin stars were more likely to close down than those without.  The paper says the findings are replicated in London and France. It seems staff may seek higher wages after an award and landlords more rent. The paper asks if chefs focus too much on pleasing the guide, rather than their customers.

It says Hassan Nasrallah inspired fervent adulation - as well as bitter enmity from his foes - and will be hard to replace. The front page of the Sunday Times shows a picture of a man surveying the wreckage of at least six residential buildings at the site of an Israeli attack in Beirut. The paper reports that 50,000 people have now fled Lebanon for Syria. It adds that Nasrallah's death is a transformative moment for Hezbollah. An expert on the group tells the Sunday Telegraph the strike that killed Nasrallah - coupled with the recent wave of pager and walkie-talkie explosions - means that the fighters now running Hezbollah are ""young and inexperienced"", potentially preventing it from being able to escalate the conflict with Israel. But analysis in the Sunday Mirror says that, although bruised, the group is still a powerful opponent. Elsewhere, The Observer has seen analysis which suggests the chancellor's cut to the winter fuel allowance in England and Wales may save significantly less money than had been hoped. The cut was expected to remove the payment from around 10m pensioners, but not those on pension credit.  However, research from Policy in Practice - an organisation which alerts older people to their eligibility for financial help - says tens of thousands have now made claims for pension support in England and Wales, which opens up a series of other benefits since the announcement. The Sun on Sunday claims the government is considering cigarette-style health warnings on junk food packaging, as part of a drive to reduce childhood obesity. It calls the idea a ""nanny-state crackdown"" following a measure which bans fast food adverts from being broadcast before 21:00 BST, and restricts under-16s from buying highly-caffeinated drinks. According to the Sunday Mirror, 1,000 civil servants were assigned to work on the previous government's plan to send migrants to Rwanda. The paper says that was 20 times more than the number working to reduce violence against women and girls. The Sunday People reports that US investigators have flown to London to begin looking into whether the rapper, P Diddy, committed offences in the UK. And finally, the Mail on Sunday, features an extract from Boris Johnson’s memoirs, where the former prime minister writes that he believes Covid-19 originated in a Chinese lab, and not a market in Wuhan. He adds that some scientists were ""clearly splicing bits of the virus together like the witches in Macbeth."" Elsewhere, Mr Johnson writes that he is no longer convinced the Covid-19 lockdowns were successful in reducing the number of fatalities during the pandemic. The Sunday Times says scientists are working on a process to reintroduce the dodo, which was driven to extinction in 1662, just 24 years after being discovered by humans. It says they plan to edit the genome of a Nicobar pigeon - the dodo's closest living relative species - and blend it with the genome of the extinct bird, which has been sourced from museum specimens.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx9z96ldveo,UN General Assembly demands Israel ends occupation of Palestinian territories,"Israel denounces the Palestinian-drafted, non-binding resolution as ""diplomatic terrorism"".",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:57.027206,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UN General Assembly has adopted a Palestinian-drafted, non-binding resolution demanding Israel end ""its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"" within 12 months. There were 124 votes in favour and 14 against, including Israel, along with 43 abstentions. As a non-member observer state, Palestine could not vote. The resolution is based on a July advisory opinion from the UN's highest court that said Israel was occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip against international law. The Palestinian ambassador called the vote a turning point “in our struggle for freedom and justice”. But his Israeli counterpart denounced it as “diplomatic terrorism”. Although the General Assembly’s resolutions are not binding, they carry symbolic and political weight given they reflect the positions of all 193 member states of the UN. It comes after almost a year of war in Gaza, which began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. More than 41,110 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There has also been a spike in violence in the West Bank over the same period, in which the UN says more than 680 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed. Another 10 Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in Israel. The advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) - which was also not legally binding - said a 15-judge panel had found that ""Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful” and that the country was “under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence... as rapidly as possible”. The court also said Israel should “evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory” and “make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned”. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court said the settlements “have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law”, which Israel has consistently disputed. Israel's prime minister said at the time that the court had made a ""decision of lies"" and insisted that “the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land”. Wednesday’s General Assembly resolution welcomed the ICJ’s declaration. It demands that Israel “brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory... and do so no later than 12 months”, and “comply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law”. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry described its passing as a “pivotal and historic moment for the Palestinian cause and international law”. It emphasised that the support of almost two thirds of UN member states reflected “a global consensus that the occupation must end and its crimes must cease”, and that it “reaffirmed the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination”. Israel’s foreign ministry called the resolution “a distorted decision that is disconnected from reality, encourages terrorism and harms the chances for peace”, adding: “This is what cynical international politics looks like.” It said the resolution “bolsters and strengthens the Hamas terrorist organisation” and “sends a message that terrorism pays off and yields international resolutions”. It also accused the Palestinian Authority of “conducting a campaign whose goal is not to resolve the conflict but to harm Israel” and vowed to respond. The US, which voted against the resolution, warned beforehand that the text was “one-sided” and “selectively interprets the substance of the ICJ’s opinion”. “There is no path forward or hope offered through this resolution today. Its adoption will not save Palestinian lives, bring the hostages home, end Israeli settlements, or reinvigorate the peace process,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. The UK’s ambassador, Barbara Woodward, explained that it had abstained “not because we do not support the central findings of the ICJ's advisory opinion, but rather because the resolution does not provide sufficient clarity to effectively advance our shared aim of a peace premised on a negotiated two-state solution”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgll5268e2o,Israel vows 'heavy price' for Houthi missile strike,It is the first time a missile fired by the armed Yemeni group has reached central Israel.,15 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:57.124904,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Yemen's Houthis will pay a ""heavy price"" after a missile fired by the group landed in central Israel.  The Israeli military said the missile landed in an uninhabited area early on Sunday, but that shrapnel indicated air defence systems had failed to destroy it before it entered Israeli airspace.  It added that it was investigating how the missile was able to reach so far into Israeli territory.  The strike marks the first time a missile fired by the group has reached central Israel, which is around 2,000km (1,240 miles) from Yemen.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been repeated attempts to shoot the missile down on Sunday but that it most likely fragmented in mid-air.  The Houthis claimed the operation used a new type of hypersonic missile, which may help explain the failure of efforts to intercept it.  They are an armed group that seized much of Yemen in the country’s ongoing civil war and have declared themselves part of the Iran-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US, and the wider West. The Houthis said in a statement that Sunday's attack was carried out in solidarity with the Palestinians and that Israel should expect more ahead of the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks. Missile fragments landed at a railway station in the city of Modiin, causing some damage, and in open ground near Israel's main international airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.  The damage is believed to have been caused by Israel's own interceptor missiles.  Netanyahu said the strike showed that Israel was in a ""multi-front battle against Iran's axis of evil that strives to destroy us"". ""[The Houthis] should have known by now that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us,"" he said.  ""Anyone who attacks us will not escape from our arms.  ""Hamas is already learning this in our determined action that will lead to its destruction and the release of all of our hostages."" Israeli forces launched a campaign to destroy Hamas following the 7 October attacks, which saw around 1,200 people killed and another 251 taken to Gaza as hostages.  More than 41,206 people have been killed in Gaza since the campaign began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. This is not the first time the Houthis have attacked Israel.  In July, one man was killed and eight people were injured after a Houthi drone landed in Tel Aviv.  Previously, almost all Houthi missiles and drones fired towards Israel had been intercepted and none were known to have reached Tel Aviv. In response, Israeli jets attacked the city of Hodeidah in Yemen, causing a huge fire which engulfed one of the country’s most important oil storage facilities."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0gg9k76w9o,UN Gaza aid chief: World is failing innocent civilians,Sigrid Kaag tells the BBC the crisis in Gaza is a “catastrophe” as fighting between Israel and Hamas continues.,16 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:05.826736,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UN’s most senior official overseeing aid and reconstruction in Gaza has told the BBC that the international community is collectively failing innocent civilians in the territory. Sigrid Kaag, who was appointed nine months ago to improve the delivery of urgently needed aid, said a report she is due to make to the UN Security Council today would be “very sombre and perhaps dark”. She described the situation in the territory as a “significant catastrophe”. “We're not meeting the needs, let alone creating prospects and hope for the civilians in Gaza.” In a rare interview, the senior UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Action and Reconstruction in Gaza said the systems to deliver assistance - including through multiple land and sea routes into Gaza - were now in place.  And ""the UN is working around the clock and people are risking their lives day in, day out"". But she called Gaza “the most unsafe place in the world to work”. She said she regretted that “not much else can be improved” until there was a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages still being held there. Ms Kaag said that what is known as “deconfliction"" - to ensure aid missions can proceed safely - was failing: “It’s not working, or working insufficiently, to render the operations feasible.” Last week the UN said another of its aid convoys heading into northern Gaza was blocked by Israeli forces, and Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said a UN school operating as a shelter was targeted by an Israeli air strike, killing 18 people. The UN said six of its staff died. Israel accused Hamas of using the facility as “a command and control centre” and said Hamas fighters were among the dead. The UN says nearly 300 aid workers, more than two-thirds of them UN staff, have been killed so far in the grievous Gaza war, which is now approaching the one-year mark. Ms Kaag, one of the few UN officials to meet senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, described her discussions as “constructive”.  “We put asks on the table. Some are met. We also obtain commitments.” But she pointed out that “between the commitment and the time that it takes to see visible and tangible implementation, too much time passes”. “There is not a day, not a second to lose,” she told the BBC in an interview from New York. Israeli officials have repeatedly insisted enough aid is reaching Gaza, and deny reports of widespread and severe hunger. Ms Kaag said that “we do know from our surveys and studies that the majority of the population is food insecure” and the UN’s health centres know “how many malnourished or acutely malnourished children or babies come in”. Asked about Israeli accusations that the main problem with food delivery was Hamas’s diversion of aid, Ms Kaag replied: “We hear that a lot. I find that very difficult to confirm."" She said that in a war zone “I can’t say everything goes right all the time,” but emphasised: “I can vouch for the integrity of the operations of our colleagues.” She described Unrwa - the UN’s largest aid agency working in Gaza - as “the backbone of the totality of UN delivery.” Netanyahu has accused the agency of being “totally infiltrated"" by Hamas and has called for it to be “terminated”. Ms Kaag said investigations have taken place into Israeli allegations that Unrwa staff were involved in Hamas’s unprecedented attacks of 7 October across southern Israel, and that whenever evidence was provided investigations would continue. Last month the agency fired nine UNRWA workers - it had previously sacked 12 employees, and put seven others on administrative leave, out of its Gaza workforce of 13,000. Ms Kaag, a former Dutch deputy prime minister who first worked on Israeli-Palestinian issues 30 years ago, says she is often asked by Gazans during her visits there: “When will our suffering end?” She spoke of the deep trauma of this conflict, including for Israeli hostages, and expressed hope that all those working to resolve this crisis would be forgiven.  “If we’re too slow, too little, too late, and if they feel that we failed them, the only thing we can do is work even harder.” But she underlined “there is no compensation for lives lost and trauma incurred; nothing will make that right”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30lpyl46z3o,"Bowen: Tactical triumph for Israel, but Hezbollah won't be deterred","Reports said Israel's planned attack was not used in the way they hoped, and was triggered early.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:05.925466,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"It has been the deadliest year in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians since 1948, when Israel fought and won its war for independence – and this is one of the most dangerous moments since Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October last year. Attacking Hezbollah’s communications network has delivered a tactical victory to Israel - the sort of spectacular coup you would read about in a thriller. However there is a potentially serious strategic downside for Israel, because while this humiliates the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement, it doesn’t deter them.  And it doesn’t get closer to Israel’s strategic aim of stopping Hezbollah’s attacks and allowing the more than 60,000 Israelis on the northern border who haven’t been in their houses for nearly a year to return home. The Israelis have used important, audacious weapons, which are clearly very effective in their terms.  But reports in Al Monitor, a respected Middle East newsletter, say that they were not able to use them in the way they hoped. The original plan, it says, was for Israel to follow up with devastating attacks while Hezbollah was still reeling. The pager attack, the reports say, was to be the opening salvo in a big escalation - as part of an offensive or perhaps an invasion of southern Lebanon. But these same reports say that Hezbollah was getting suspicious – forcing Israel to trigger these attacks early. So the Israelis have shown they can get into Hezbollah’s communications and shown they can humiliate them, but these attacks do not take the region one inch further back from all out war. Instead they push it closer. Everything at the moment in terms of de-escalation in the Middle East depends on Gaza. While that war continues, whether it’s conflict with Lebanon, whether it’s attacks in the Red Sea from the Houthis, whether it’s tensions with Iraq; nothing is going to de-escalate.  The US envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein has been working assiduously for months now - talking to the Lebanese, and indirectly to Hezbollah and to the Israelis, about trying to find a way to deescalate this diplomatically. And reportedly, the Israelis didn’t tell the US about what they were doing with this plan until last moments - so this won’t help his efforts either. American predictions that a ceasefire in Gaza is close have come up again against two seemingly immovable objects.  One is the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, who wants Israel out of the Gaza Strip permanently, as well as a big release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza.  The other is Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has stuck to his insistence that Israel can and will win a total victory over Hamas.  The consensus in Israel is that he benefits from prolonging the war, despite pressure from hostage families and their supporters for a deal to get their people home.   The prime minister’s ultranationalist allies in his coalition have also threatened to bring down the government if he makes a deal. Israel and its allies insist that taking the war to its old enemies in Lebanese Hezbollah is an entirely legitimate act of self-defence.  But there is fury and alarm in Lebanon and the wider region that Israel’s attacks appear to have been launched with little concern for bystanders and family members who have been wounded and killed alongside Hezbollah fighters. CCTV footage showed a pager exploding in a crowded market as its owner shopped for food. Reports in Lebanon say a young girl was killed when her father’s pager exploded. Hezbollah will be reeling from the attacks, but it will rapidly compose itself as an organisation and will find other ways to communicate. Lebanon is a small country and messages can easily be carried by hand. Undoubtedly Hezbollah and its allies in Iran, whose ambassador to Beirut was wounded in the attack, will be licking their wounds at the moment. But once again the region has been pushed right to the brink of an all-out war.  Sooner or later, if this continues,  they will fall over the cliff."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0g6zr7gz1o,Mason happy to repeat 'no genocide' claim after SNP expulsion,The veteran SNP politician has been expelled from the party after claiming there is no genocide in Gaza.,2 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:29:06.017447,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An MSP who was expelled from the SNP over social media posts about the Israel-Gaza war says he stands by his comments. John Mason said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" to be expelled, but was ""happy"" to repeat the comments that led to his initial suspension.  The Glasgow Shettleston MSP had the whip removed in August following a post on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. He said he was considering appealling his expulsion, which was confirmed on Saturday. The SNP have said they cannot comment on ongoing disciplinary process. At the time of his initial suspension, a spokesperson for the SNP chief whip described Mason's comments as ""utterly abhorrent"".  Mason - who had been an SNP MSP for 16 years - told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""To be expelled over a disagreement over the definition of a word – an important word, genocide – but to be expelled for that reason is extremely disappointing.”   He said he was ""happy"" to repeat his claims.  “There is a war going on,"" the MSP, who will now sit at Holyrood as an independent, said.  ""Lives have been lost, desperately sadly, as they have been in Ukraine, as they have been in every war. “But there is a difference between war and genocide and to say that every war is genocide is not the way we use that word.” He said he “totally regretted” the loss of life but that Israel feels “very threatened”. Mason told the BBC: “We don’t tend to say that the bombing of German cities was genocide, we don’t tend to say that Hiroshima was genocide – these were acts of war, maybe disproportionate. “Genocide is a very serious word,” he added. “To just mix up the words genocide and war is not accurate.” The SNP Member Conduct Committee, which ruled that Mason should be expelled, accused Mason of claiming to be the “arbiter” of what is considered to be genocide, describing that as “unacceptable and offensive”. In a letter to the MSP, the committee also said he had misrepresented SNP policy and had shown “no contrition”. Mason denied was was claiming to be the “arbiter” of what was genocide and called for the party to be “tolerant” on such issues. He said the SNP should be a “big tent”, adding: “On issues like this that are not central to independence, we should allow a bit of latitude so that no one person is the arbiter of a word like genocide.” The Shettleston MSP said he supported the party in calling for a two-state solution the conflict, but said he did not understand the party policy he is accused of disagreeing with. Mason, 67, said he had already decided to retire at the next election, scheduled for 2026.  He has been given 21 days to appeal but said he would be prepared see out the remainder of the term as an independent. The MSP added: “If I am independent then I have a bit more freedom but I will be doing all I can to support the SNP.” About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage during Hamas’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Since then, more than 42,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Jonathan Freedland, Hadley Freeman and David Aaronovitch announced they were quitting their columns over what Freedland described as a ""great disgrace"" at the London-based newspaper. It comes after the JC said it conducted a ""thorough investigation"" into one of its freelance journalists, Elon Perry, ""after allegations were made about aspects of his record"". It said it was ""not satisfied"" with some of the claims made by the writer, and therefore had deleted his articles and ended its association with him. Jonathan Freedland - who described the stories as fabricated - said the JC had shown only the ""thinnest form of contrition"". Hadley Freeman said recent events made it impossible for her to stay, while Aaronovitch said he, too, had left the paper. A statement from a spokesperson for David Baddiel said on Sunday the comedian also had ""no plans to write any more columns for"" for the Jewish Chronicle. JC editor Jake Wallis Simons said on Sunday that he understood ""why some columnists have decided to step back from the paper"".  ""I am grateful for their contributions and hope that, in time, some of them will feel able to return,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""I take full responsibility for the mistakes that have been made and I will take equal responsibility for the task of making sure nothing like this can happen again."" Wallis Simons said ""it’s every newspaper editor’s worst nightmare to be deceived by a journalist"". He added: ""Readers can be assured that stronger internal procedures are being implemented."" Elon Perry told BBC News the JC ""made a huge mistake with its statement"". He said he could not reveal his source to JC editors and described a ""witch-hunt against me caused by jealousy"". Perry describes himself in an online biography as having worked as a lecturer and a journalist, as well as ""a commando in the Israeli army, taking part in numerous operations in pursuing terrorists in Gaza, the West Bank, and in Lebanon"". The JC said on Friday: ""While we understand he did serve in the Israel Defence Forces, we were not satisfied with some of his claims. We have therefore removed his stories from our website and ended any association with Mr Perry."" It did not specify which claims it was referring to. In recent months, Perry has written a series of articles for the JC. The most contentious was a piece he wrote claiming a document showed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was planning to smuggle himself and some surviving Israeli hostages out of Gaza and to Iran, via the Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land on the Gaza-Egypt border.  The article's claims appeared to be similar to talking points used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to justify the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) presence in the Philadelphi Corridor.  The story was followed up by media in Israel, and later shared by Netanyahu's son. According to the Times of Israel, the IDF subsequently said it had no knowledge of such a document existing. Freedland - who has written for the JC since 1998 - said his attachment to the paper ""runs very deep"", beginning with his late father who also wrote for it. ""That bond partly explains why I've stuck with it even as it departed from the traditions that built its reputation as the world's oldest Jewish newspaper,"" he wrote on X. ""Too often, the JC reads like a partisan, ideological instrument, its judgements political rather than journalistic."" He also warned that there was ""no real accountability"" because the newspaper is owned ""by a person or people who refuse to reveal themselves"". Freedland was referring to the ownership of the Jewish Chronicle following its purchase by a consortium led by Sir Robbie Gibb in 2020. Sir Robbie, who is a member of the governing board of the BBC, was listed as the sole “person with significant control” on the Companies House register until August this year when he resigned and ceased to be a director. Freedland concluded by saying that he was breaking his connection with the paper because he no longer recognised it. His post was shared by Aaronovitch, who wrote: ""I have done the same."" Meanwhile, Hadley Freeman said she was ""immensely grateful"" for all the support she has had on the paper, but said she was no longer able to remain as a columnist in light of recent developments. BBC News has contacted the JC for further comment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjrzlrjwdgo,'Walkie-talkie blasts' and conflict's 'new phase',"Thursday's headlines are dominated by walkie-talkie blasts in Lebanon, a day after pagers exploded.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:06.320568,Israel War,BBC,Middle East," Attacks in Lebanon are on most front pages. ""Death by walkie talkie"" is the Sun's line, while the Daily Mirror and the Daily Telegraph describe the explosion of hand-held radios as a ""walkie talkie blitz."" The Guardian says international observers have warned that the simultaneous detonation of thousands of booby-trapped communications devices may constitute a war crime. An article by a Lebanese journalist in the Daily Mail describes how Beirut has collapsed into panic with wild rumours doing rounds that solar panels, batteries and fridges might also explode. But there is, he says, one small silver lining - a sense of togetherness, with people from Christian and Sunni neighbourhoods queueing to donate blood, even though many of them loath Hezbollah whose members are Shia Muslims. Analysis in the Times says the apparent Israeli intelligence operation has humiliated Hezbollah. The paper says the blow will be felt across the organisation - from commanders to rank-and-file members, and many of them will now question the wisdom of their leadership. In an interview for the Daily Mail Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accuses the UK government of undermining his country. He says Britain's decision to suspend some arms export licences to Israel sends ""a horrible message"" to Hamas. Mr Netanyahu also said it would be preposterous if the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest. Almost all papers report that Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Sue Gray, earns £170,000 - £3,000 thousand more than the prime minister. The Times describes the leak as another embarrassment for Sir Keir and says it highlights dysfunction at the heart of No. 10. In an editorial the Telegraph says the pay rise for Ms Gray points to what it calls ""an arrogant propensity to lecture the rest of us about ethical behaviour our leaders singularly fail  to observe themselves."" The paper says Labour chiefs taking big pay rises, just after they have cut the winter fuel payment for millions of pensioners is further evidence of this government's breath-taking hypocrisy. According to the i the Treasury is braced for bad news when the latest data on public finances is released on Friday. Last month's figures showed the government borrowed £3bn more than forecast in the spring, and the paper says a similar higher-than-expected borrowing figure would add to the pressure on the chancellor to announce spending cuts and tax increases in the budget next month. In an editorial the Sun calls for a change in the sentencing rules to ensure that paedophiles caught with the worst child sexual abuse images go to prison. The paper describes the suspended jail sentence handed down to the former BBC presenter Huw Edwards as a ""shocking leniency"" which it says should be the trigger for a new intolerance towards perverts fuelling a heinous global trade which destroys children's lives. And the Daily Telegraph says Donald trump's wife, Melania, has defended her nude modelling in the 1990s. In a video for her new book she said the photoshoots were a ""means of  self-expression.""

The Irish cabinet agreed to the move on Wednesday following a request from the World Health Organization (WHO). Government departments have been working on the proposal alongside medical doctors and the Irish Red Cross (IRC) for a number of months.  Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this is a ""modest but important step given the scale of the horrific conflict by the Israeli military forces"". Israeli forces launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group in Gaza in response to its attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The plan aims to bring up to 30 children from Gaza to Ireland this year.  The children will travel with a carer, who will be accommodated in homes managed by the IRC.  All patients and carers are required to get health screenings before travelling.  Translation services will be provided and other assistance to access services. The Health Service Executive (HSE) will also provide appropriate psycho-social assessment for both patients and carers.  Children with a range of medical conditions will be treated in Ireland.  Donnelly said the loss of life in the conflict is ""devastating, particularly the loss of life of civilian men, women and children"".  ""Our health service will work with colleagues across government, across the EU and with the WHO to provide medical evacuation and treatment to those impacted.""  As an EU member state, Ireland is asked to respond to the request from the WHO to assist in addressing the current health needs in Gaza. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e1wpr0q44o,Hezbollah device explosions: The unanswered questions,"The sabotage of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies has raised many who, what and whys.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:06.672355,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"After thousands of pagers and radio devices exploded in two separate incidents in Lebanon - injuring thousands of people and killing at least 37 - details are still being pieced together as to how such an operation was carried out. Lebanon and Hezbollah, whose members and communication systems were targeted, have blamed Israel – though Israel is yet to comment. The BBC has followed a trail from Taiwan, to Japan, Hungary, Israel and back to Lebanon. Here are the unanswered questions. Some early speculation suggested that the pagers could have been targeted by a complex hack that caused them to explode. But that theory was quickly dismissed by experts.  To cause damage on the scale that they did, it is probable they were rigged with explosives before they entered Hezbollah’s possession, experts say.  Images of the broken remains of the pagers show the logo of a small Taiwanese electronics manufacturer: Gold Apollo. The BBC visited the company’s offices, situated on a large business park in a nondescript suburb of Taipei. The company's founder, Hsu Ching-Kuang, seemed shocked. He denied the business had anything to do with the operation. “You look at the pictures from Lebanon,” he told reporters outside his firm's offices. ""They don’t have any mark saying Made in Taiwan on them, we did not make those pagers!” Instead - he pointed to a Hungarian company: BAC Consulting. Mr Hsu said that three years ago he had licensed Gold Apollo’s trademark to BAC, allowing them to use Gold Apollo’s name on their own pagers. He said the money transfers from BAC had been ""very strange"" - and that there had been problems with the payments, which had come from the Middle East. The BBC went to the registered office of BAC Consulting, situated in a residential area of the Hungarian capital, Budapest. The address appeared to be shared by 12 other companies - and no-one in the building could tell us anything about BAC Consulting at all.  Officials in Hungary say the firm, which was first incorporated in 2022, was merely a “trading intermediary with no manufacturing or operational site” in the country. A brochure for BAC, published on LinkedIn, lists eight organisations it claims to have worked with - including the UK Department for International Development (DfID). The UK Foreign Office - which has taken on DfID's responsibilities - told the BBC it was in the process of investigating. But based on initial conversations, it said it did not have any involvement with BAC. BAC's website listed one person as its chief executive and founder - Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono. The BBC made several attempts to contact Ms Bársony-Arcidiacono, but were unable to reach her.  However, she did reportedly speak to NBC News, saying: ""I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate.” So who is really behind BAC Consulting? The New York Times has reported that the company was in fact a front for Israeli intelligence. The newspaper, citing three Israeli officials, said that two other shell companies were created to help hide the identities of the people who were really producing the pagers: Israeli intelligence officers. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these reports - but we do know that Bulgarian authorities have now begun investigating another company linked to BAC. Bulgarian broadcaster bTV reported on Thursday that 1.6 million euros ($1.8m; £1.3m) connected to the device attacks in Lebanon passed through Bulgaria and was later sent to Hungary. The origins of the radio devices, which exploded in the second wave of attacks, are less clear. We know that at least some of those that exploded were the IC-V82 model produced by the Japanese company, ICOM. Those devices were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, according to a security source speaking to Reuters news agency. Earlier, a sales executive at the US subsidiary of Icom told the Associated Press news agency that the exploded radio devices in Lebanon appeared to be knockoff products that were not made by the company – adding that it was easy to find counterfeit versions online. It took the BBC a matter of seconds to find Icom IC-V82s listed for sale in online marketplaces. ICOM said in a statement it had stopped manufacturing and selling the model almost a decade ago, in October 2014 - and said it had also discontinued production of the batteries needed to operate it. The company said it does not outsource manufacturing overseas - and all its radios are produced at a factory in Western Japan. According to Kyodo news agency, Icom director Yoshiki Enomoyo suggested that photos of the damage around the battery compartment of the exploded walkie-talkies suggest they may have been retrofitted with explosives. Videos show victims reaching into their pockets in the seconds before the devices detonated, causing chaos in streets, shops and homes across the country. Lebanese authorities have concluded that the devices were detonated by ""electronic messages"" sent to them, according to a letter by the Lebanese mission to the UN, seen by Reuters news agency. Citing US officials, the New York Times said that the pagers received messages that appeared to be coming from Hezbollah's leadership before detonating. The messages instead appeared to trigger the devices, the outlet reported. We do not yet know what kind of message was sent to the radio devices. This is the question many in Lebanon are now asking - paranoid that other devices, cameras, phones or laptops could have also been rigged with explosives. The Lebanese Army has been on the streets of Beirut using a remote-controlled bomb disposal robot to carry out controlled explosions. BBC crews in Lebanon have been stopped and told not to use their phones or cameras. ""Everyone is just panicking… We don’t know if we can stay next to our laptops, our phones. Everything seems like a danger at this point, and no-one knows what to do,” one woman, Ghida, told a BBC correspondent. There are several theories as to why the devices were triggered to explode this week. One is that Israel chose this moment to send a devastating message to Hezbollah, following almost a year of escalating cross-border hostilities after Hezbollah fired rockets at or around northern Israel a day after the Hamas attack of 7 October. The other is that Israel did not intend to put its plan in motion at this moment, but was forced to after fearing the plot was about to be exposed.  According to US outlet Axios, the original plan was for the pager attack to be the opening salvo of an all-out war as a way to try to cripple Hezbollah’s fighters. But, it says, after Israel learned that Hezbollah had become suspicious, it chose to carry out the attack early."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5evx4y7xo,Why war in Middle East involves UK more than you might think,"Burning conflict in Lebanon and Gaza leaves Britain with practical, defence and diplomatic moves to make.",5 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:13.862003,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"""Let’s be real, the war has started,"" a former minister tells me. ""What happens in the Middle East never stays in the Middle East."" It’s hard not to be moved by the burning conflict – the killing of Israelis by Hamas almost a year ago and agony of the families of hostages snatched; the killing of thousands of Gazans by Israel in its response and the terrible suffering there. And now Lebanon, where Israel has struck again after almost a year of cross-border hostilities, killing hundreds in air strikes against Hezbollah. Hundreds of thousands more civilians are on the move, desperate to find safety. But it can feel bewildering, and far away. So why does it matter at home? ""There’s the humanitarian horror,"" says a former diplomat. And of course there are many families in the UK worried about the safety of friends or relatives still in Lebanon, Israel and Gaza. There is a potential bump in the number of refugees likely to head for Europe from Lebanon if all-out war begins. The conflict has stirred tensions here as well. ""We see it on our streets,"" the former minister says, whether that’s at Gaza protests, the rise in antisemitism or even a handful of pro-Palestinian politicians winning seats in Parliament. If - as US President Joe Biden has acknowledged in public - Israel goes ahead and hits Iran’s oil industry, the costs could hit us all. The price of oil jumped 5% after Biden’s remarks. Iran is the seventh biggest oil producer in the world. Just at a time when the world has been getting used to inflation cooling down, spiralling costs of energy could pump it right back up again and we’d all feel it. One source suggested if the conflict keeps intensifying, ""the Iranians might block the crucial Strait of Hormuz to show their power"" which could, they suggest, ""tip us into a 70s style crisis"". Around 20% of the world’s oil passes through the narrow channel of water. ""It’s the pocket book effect,"" says another Whitehall source. The impact on the economy could be huge. So what can the UK do about a hellishly complicated situation, especially with a new government that is still finding its feet? There’s the practical, the defence, and the diplomatic. The Foreign Office has chartered three flights to get Brits who live in Lebanon home - and a fourth is scheduled to leave Beirut on Sunday. There are extra military staff in Cyprus ready to provide extra help if needs be.  The UK is deeply involved in providing humanitarian help in the region and Labour made the decision to start money flowing again to the UN organisation for Palestinian refugees on the ground, UNWRA, once it moved into power. The UK military was there as back-up to help Israel defend itself against Iranian missiles this week. RAF Typhoons were in the air on Tuesday night ready to support Israel’s own defences. Israel also had support from the US. In the end, the UK didn’t fire any of their weapons. But back in April, RAF Typhoon jets based in Cyprus shot down Iranian drones. Yet there are nerves in Labour circles about how far that role might go now in the coming weeks. One senior MP said: ‘‘We can be there to help defend Israel, we can be America’s mate, but we must not be there in any way, however small, in attacking Iran."" The UK is in what a former ambassador described as a ""weird straddle"". Ministers are urging Israel to hold back its attacks across Lebanon, just as through the last 12 months they have asked Britain's ally to stop pummelling Gaza. But at the same time, when called upon, helping Israel defend itself on specific occasions. And even though some arms sales have been suspended, weapons continue to go. Then when it comes to the diplomacy, a former senior official tells me the UK is ""thinking about the off ramps,"" - in other words, encouraging all the players, not just its allies, to think about how to bring the conflict to an end, and what a post-war settlement might look like. The UK has specific opportunities - there are things that it can do that the US can’t, with an embassy still in the Iranian capital Tehran, for example, whereas the Americans haven’t had any formal diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980. ""Diplomacy is not only about talking to your friends,"" the former official says, suggesting the UK has a role to play in understanding Iran’s position and communicating it to others to ensure Israel and the US's decisions ""aren't taken based on misunderstandings"". The specifics of the UK’s position have been used to diplomatic advantage before.  A former minister tells me when the families of hostages from Israel were in London, a meeting was brokered between them and the Qatari chief negotiator, an encounter that couldn’t have taken place elsewhere given the state of relations between their two countries. Another source says that when it comes to Iran, the UK ""is not just a back-channel, we can be the front channel"". Foreign Secretary David Lammy held a phone conversation with the Iranian foreign minister in August. There is a limit to the influence that can be brought to bear, not just because of the realities in the region.  The UK’s voice is important, but not a deciding influence - ""the only critical external player is the US,"" says one Whitehall source. And fundamentally, perhaps the reality right now is that ""no-one is scared of America any more,"" as one senior government figure suggests. Months of urging restraint have not brought an end to the conflict - anything but. Whether politicians in the UK have the appetite for greater involvement is worth asking.  Foreign policy rarely yields rewards for politicians at home in the UK - and it can also feel like a distraction having to travel the globe while dealing with rows over free gifts and winter fuel payments. Sir Keir Starmer has found himself ""spending more time on a plane than he ever expected,"" a senior MP suggests. Diplomacy matters, whether its impact is easy to measure or not. A government insider suggests without the UK, US and Western allies urging restraint on a daily basis, there is a parallel universe where the conflicts might already have boiled over into a war far worse than anything we have seen so far. ""Everybody has been working incredibly hard to try and prevent a spillover,"" a senior figure says. The question this weekend is whether a terrible conflict that sucks in the US and other powers can yet be avoided. How Israel chooses to respond to Iran’s attacks may prove decisive. A lot is at stake: a wider conflict could wreak havoc on our economy, on the stability of the world, and as well as the terrible toll on civilians caught up in wars not of their own making. ""Our best labour is diplomacy,"" a former minister says. The UK certainly cannot stop or solve this dangerous conundrum on its own. But the gravity of what is going on means that it has to try.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89w98xnjk2o,Israeli special forces 'raid missile site in Syria',US media say the operation included special forces who rappelled down from helicopters.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:13.962225,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Details are emerging of an apparent raid by Israeli special forces on a ""Hezbollah missile production facility"" in Syria.  Israel's government has said nothing about the operation which, according to US media reports, took place at the beginning of the week.  Syrian state media say 18 people were killed on Monday in the raid near the Syrian city of Masyaf - around 25 miles (40km) north of the Lebanese border - and several dozen were injured. According to the New York Times, Israeli special forces descended from helicopters, placed explosives inside the Iranian-built facility and removed sensitive information. American and other officials quoted in the paper paint a picture of a daring operation, designed to destroy the underground military facility. Air strikes were apparently used to neutralise Syria’s defences and prevent reinforcements from reaching the site. Separately, a report by the Axios news site - citing three sources said to be familiar with the operation - says the elite Shaldag unit of the Israeli Air Force carried out the raid.  Axios also reports that Israel informed the US before the operation was slated to take place, and was not met with any resistance from the White House. The BBC has not yet been able to independently verify these reports. Israel's government has not commented, but the raid seems to have been designed to prevent Iran from supplying precision missiles to Hezbollah, its Lebanese ally and proxy.  Israel attacked the facility six years ago and has mounted dozens of air strikes against Syria since the war in Gaza began almost a year ago.  But, putting Israeli troops on the ground inside Syria is highly unusual.  This would be one of the most sophisticated operations of its kind in years. Last Sunday, at least 18 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on a number of military sites in the vicinity of Masyaf, according to the Syrian health minister. Israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon and Syria. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground - Israeli air and artillery strikes have targeted Syrian territory on more than 60 occasions since the start of the year. This has resulted in damage to or destruction of about 140 targets, including weapons depots, vehicles and Iran-backed militia headquarters, the SOHR said. The strikes have killed at least 208 fighters - including 46 members of Syrian government forces, 43 members of Hezbollah and 24 Iranian Revolutionary Guards - as well as 22 civilians, the monitoring group added."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevyx3x8dr8o,"After months of waiting, Gaza girls make it to Italy for burns treatment","Zeina and Alaa both suffered terrible burns in Gaza, but had to wait months to get out for treatment.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:14.259865,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Warning: Readers may find some of the details within this report upsetting “Higher,” the little girl demands, her eyes bright with excitement.  “Higher, higher.” Zeina’s being pushed on a swing in a small playground in the suburbs of the northern Italian city of Padua. A normal scene anywhere in the world. But Zeina, two, can’t move her head properly. And the right side of her face, neck and scalp are marked with deep, still angry, scars. Right now, though, she’s safe and fed. And she feels like she’s flying. Zeina is one of the 5,000 people who have been allowed to leave Gaza for specialist treatment abroad since the war broke out in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks on 7 October in southern Israel. The World Health Organization says more than 22,000 Gazans have suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the conflict - but very few have been allowed to leave the strip since the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was closed in May. “It was a day of nightmares,” says Zeina’s mother, Shaimaa, describing the moments leading up to her daughter’s injury as she was playing in their family's tent in al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, on 17 March. The family had already fled twice from their home in Khan Younis, first to Rafah and then to the sprawling “humanitarian zone” in al-Mawasi, where they thought they would be safe. Zeina and her four-year-old sister Lana had been playing together, hugging and telling each other “I love you, I love you” – Shaimaa recalls - when there was a huge air strike nearby. Zeina, terrified, ran clutching at her mother, who was holding a pot of boiling soup which spilled all over her daughter. “Her face and skin were melting in front of me,” Shaimaa says. “I picked her up and went barefoot into the street.” Medical services were stretched, she says, but Zeina was eventually treated by Red Cross doctors at Gaza’s European hospital, where she underwent a skin graft from her father’s leg, followed by a more successful graft from the skin on her own leg after she reached Egypt. Earlier this month she was flown from Egypt to Italy to access more specialised treatment. Zeina was joined by Alaa, a 17-year-old who was severely injured in an air strike on her home in Gaza City late last year. When the two girls met, they formed a bond straight away. “I took to her immediately,” Alaa says. “She’s endured so much pain for such a small child.  I’m older and sometimes the pain was too much for me. So what about her?” Alaa was trapped for 16 hours under rubble and, when she was rescued, she discovered her father, a tailor, was dead. So too were her brothers, Nael, who was a university student, and Wael, a nurse. Their bodies have never been recovered from the ruins of their four-storey building. “I was awake the whole time under the rubble,” she tells me. “I couldn’t breathe properly because of the weight on my chest and body. I couldn’t move. I was just thinking about the rest of my family and what had happened to them.” As well as her father and brothers, she also lost her grandparents and an aunt. She says they had nothing to do with Hamas. “I lost the people most precious to my heart,” she says. “I’m happy to be in Italy for treatment but inside I’m sad for Gaza and its people.” In a statement to the BBC, the Israel Defense Forces has denied targeting civilians and says it takes ""feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"" in its operation to dismantle Hamas military capabilities. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began nearly a year ago, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The World Health Organization has repeatedly called for “multiple medical evacuation corridors” for injured Palestinians. It says that only 219 patients have been allowed to leave since May. Zeina and Alaa were evacuated thanks to the persistence of a British-based charity, Save a Child, and the US-based Kinder Relief. They worked for months to get them out - petitioning Israel, Egypt and the US state department for help. “If I'm being honest, Zeina and Alaa are amongst the lucky ones who got out,” says Nadia Ali of Kinder Relief, who accompanied the girls from Egypt to Italy. “We have children who were referred to us who have died waiting to leave.” It’s hard to speak of luck when you realise the repercussions of their injuries. Months of painful physiotherapy lie ahead for both girls, followed by many rounds of surgery. Zeina and Alaa are both under the care of one of Italy’s top burns specialists. Dr Bruno Azzena is kind and gentle with them, but he has to break to them the most brutal of news – that the burns on Alaa’s legs are so deep that she will never walk normally again. And the hair on Zeina’s scarred scalp will not grow back. Her mum, Shaimaa, is devastated. She had left Gaza hoping for a miracle. Zeina has started to realise she is different from her sisters. And, when she asks Shaimaa to tie up her hair for her, like other girls, her mother doesn’t know what to do or say. Looking after her girls alone – her husband wasn’t authorised for evacuation with them – is tough, physically and emotionally.  But Shaimaa dotes on Zeina, calling her “princess,” hiding her tears - and her fears for the future - from her. She is also grieving for her own mother who died of cancer which had spread, unchecked and untreated, through her body in the months after the war. “The war has cost me so much,” she says. “Thank God we were able to leave. We left by a miracle. I hope that other injured Palestinians can leave for treatment. I always pray for God to protect them and the war to stop.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c756l4g59eko,'Exploding pager hell' and 'Middle East on brink',Wednesday's front pages focus on an attack involving exploding pagers injuring thousands in Lebanon.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:14.356410,Israel War,BBC,Middle East," The Middle East is ""holding its breath"" according to the Daily Mail after what it terms an ""astonishingly audacious attack"" on Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. The paper describes victims ""writhing in agony with hideous injuries"" when their handheld pagers exploded. The New York Times quotes American officials as saying that Israel intercepted a shipment of the devices, planted explosives inside them, and then detonated them with a message.  The Financial Times calls the attack a ""humiliating blow"" to Hezbollah, but it warns that it will heighten tensions. The Times reports that Hezbollah maintains it is ""prepared for war"", but this latest attack could leave it wondering ""what else Israel has in store"". The Daily Mirror features an exclusive interview with the man it says sparked ""the downfall"" of Huw Edwards. The 21-year-old - who sent explicit photos to the former presenter - says he was groomed. He also expresses disgust that Edwards was not sent to prison, after admitting having indecent images of children in court case this month.  On its front page, The Sun says that Edwards is ""just one of a growing number of online paedophiles spared jail"". Its investigation reveals that such criminals ""got away with hoarding"" more than a million child abuse images ""without serving a single day in jail"". The paper says the justice system ""must be rebuilt"", demanding there are ""no more slaps on the wrist"". Sources tell the Daily Telegraph that the government is drawing up legislation which would allow water companies to raise their bills to help fund a bailout of Thames Water. The paper reports that, under the plans, the full £10bn cost of intervention would be charged to firms, which could then pass it on to customers.  But government insiders insist this would be a ""last resort"". In the Daily Express, campaigners warn of a ""disaster"" if the government does not restore the winter fuel allowance for all pensioners - claiming that many will die because they will not use their heating. In its leader column, the paper warns that the government is ""running out of time to avert a humanitarian nightmare"". The Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has told the Commons that the Household Support Fund has been extended to help pensioners. Several of the papers give their verdicts on Sir Ed Davey's speech as he brought to a close the Liberal Democrats' party conference.  The Daily Mail's sketch describes it as a ""gumbo of sentimental tripe"", while the Guardian says the event was a ""happy place where where money was no object and the NHS and economy were as good as fixed"". The i calls on the Lib Dems to show they can ""truly be a proper opposition"" - warning that ""their ship risks running adrift with no clear landing strategy in sight"". And the Times asks whether the UK should ""call time on the pint"", to reduce alcohol intake. The paper reports that a study, by the University of Cambridge, has found that beer consumption dropped by 10% when pubs replaced pint glasses with those two-thirds of the size.  But drinkers in London, who spoke to the Guardian, were not so keen on the idea saying ""if you want to get drunk, it'll just take six instead of four"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxrjqz8vrno,Funeral held for US-Turkish activist killed in West Bank,Israel says it is “highly likely” the 26-year-old activist was killed by its forces last week.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:14.468876,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a joint US-Turkish citizen who was shot dead in the occupied West Bank last week. A guard of honour carried Eygi’s coffin during the funeral ceremony, which took place in her home district of Didim, in western Turkey. Israel has said it was “highly likely” the 26-year-old activist was killed by its forces during a protest in the West Bank on 6 September. Turkey says it was an intentional killing. Eygi's death has inflamed tensions between the two countries, and several Turkish government officials, including Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz, attended the funeral. Mourners carrying Palestinian and Turkish flags were seen crowding outside Didim’s Central Mosque as proceedings took place. Also among the mourners were Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmus and leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Özgür Özel. ""The blood of Ayşenur Eygi is as sacred as that of every Palestinian martyred, and we will follow it until the end,"" Kurtulmus told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. ""As the Turkish nation, we are fully committed. As a state, we are fully committed."" Prayers were held for Eygi in cities across Turkey, including Istanbul and the capital Ankara. Her mother, Rabia Birden, said on Friday: ""The only thing I ask of our state is to seek justice for my daughter,"" according to Anadolu news agency. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had previously said it was “highly likely” Eygi was ""hit indirectly and unintentionally"" by IDF fire, which was not “aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator of the riot.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the killing was “unprovoked and unjustified”. “No-one should be shot and killed for attending a protest, no-one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views,” Blinken told reporters shortly after the IDF released its statement.  Relations between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023. Turkey suspended all imports and exports from Israel in May and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has previously labelled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the ""the butcher of Gaza"".  In response to the suspension of trade, Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz accused Mr Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn400rm68o,UN says Israeli strike on Gaza school killed six of its staff,Israel's military alleges that three Unrwa employees were among nine Hamas fighters killed.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:14.565671,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says six of its employees have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school it runs in central Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said a total of 18 people were killed in Wednesday’s strike on al-Jaouni school in Nuseirat refugee camp, which is being used as a shelter by thousands of displaced Palestinians. Israel's military said it carried out a “precise strike on terrorists” planning attacks from the school. On Thursday, the military alleged that nine of those killed were members of Hamas’s armed wing and that three of them were Unrwa staff. Unrwa said the Israeli military had not requested a list of the staff who were killed, and that the names published by the military had not been previously flagged to the agency by Israeli authorities. Earlier, UN Secretary General António Guterres condemned the strike, saying: “What’s happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable.” “These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, hit out at Guterres' criticism. “It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields,” he said. Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other countries - has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes. Israeli forces launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,110 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Unrwa said Wednesday’s strike on al-Jaouni school had resulted in ""the highest death toll among our staff in a single incident"" since the start of the war. It was also the fifth time the school had been hit over the same period, it added. Video of the aftermath showed hundreds of people inspecting the heavily damaged ground floor of one wing of the school, as well as the remains of an adjoining structure that appeared to have been destroyed. Other footage showed ambulances bringing wounded men, women and children said to have been hurt in the strike to al-Aqsa hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah. “My friend and her children were injured, and the director and deputy director [of the shelter] were martyred. They were inside the office when the shelling started,” one woman told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme. “It's hard to describe the horrible scene where their bodies were torn into pieces,” she added. Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal said on Wednesday night that 18 people were killed, including Unrwa staff members, children and women, and that 18 others were injured. A Telegram post from the agency identified one of those killed as the daughter of one of its rescue workers, Momin Salmi. It said he had not seen Shadia for 10 months because he had stayed in northern Gaza while his wife and their eight children had fled southwards. The BBC was not able to independently verify the death toll, but a medical source at al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat camp told AFP that a total of 15 people killed in the strike had been brought there and to al-Aqsa hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that aircraft had “conducted a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a Hamas command and control centre” embedded inside al-Jaouni school. “Numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence,” it added. “This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organisation’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law.” Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office accused Israel of a “brutal massacre”. Later, Unrwa said in a statement that two air strikes had hit the school and its surroundings, which were home to around 12,000 displaced people, mainly women and children. ""Among those killed was the manager of the Unrwa shelter and other team members providing assistance to displaced people,"" it said. The agency insisted that ""schools and other civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times"", adding: ""They are not a target."" ""We call on all parties to the conflict to never use schools or the areas around them for military or fighting purposes."" On Thursday afternoon, the IDF put out a statement saying that it had repeatedly requested from Unrwa the names of the employees who were killed in the strike, but that it had received “no answers”. It then named nine men who it alleged were “Hamas terrorists... confirmed to have been eliminated in the strike”. The IDF said all nine were members of Hamas’s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, and that three of them were “simultaneously an Unrwa employee”. Three names featured on a list of the six Unrwa workers which was earlier released by the UN. “How long will the UN continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over Unrwa?” Mr Danon said. “These murderers are not aid workers. They are terrorists with blood on their hands and were rightly eliminated.” Unrwa’s communications director, Juliette Touma, said Israeli authorities had not requested a list of staff killed from the agency. “The names that appear on today’s statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today,” she said. “Unrwa shares the lists of all its staff with the host governments and in the context of the West Bank and Gaza also with the state of Israel as the occupying power.” Ms Touma also stressed that Unrwa had repeatedly called on the warring parties to never use civilian facilities for military purposes. “Now whether this particular school or other have been used for that very purpose, Unrwa is not in a position to determine,” she added. “This is precisely why we have repeatedly called for independent investigations to look into these very serious claims.” Israel has previously accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas. The agency has denied this, but the UN said in August that it had fired nine of Unrwa's 13,000 staff in Gaza after investigators found evidence that they might have been involved in the 7 October attack. Another 10 staff were cleared because of insufficient evidence. Israel also alleged that hundreds of Unrwa staff were members of terrorist groups, but a UN review published in April found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims. Hours before the incident, Unrwa said in a situation report that almost 70% of its schools in Gaza had been hit during the war. It also reported that 214 of its staff members had been killed, along with at least 563 displaced people who had been sheltering inside its schools and other installations. In a separate development on Wednesday, the IDF announced that two Israeli soldiers had been killed and eight others injured in a helicopter crash overnight in southern Gaza. The helicopter was on a mission to evacuate a critically injured soldier to a hospital for medical treatment and crashed while landing in the Rafah area, a statement said. “An initial inquiry conducted indicates that the crash was not caused by enemy fire. The cause of the crash is still under investigation,” it added."

The first strike took place around dawn on Wednesday and killed five young men in Tubas, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it targeted an armed ""terrorist cell” during a counter-terrorism operation in the city. The IDF adds that it conducted a second strike in the evening during a separate operation in Tulkarm. The Red Crescent says three people were killed when a car was hit.  Meanwhile, an Israeli soldier was killed in what the IDF said was a ramming attack involving a fuel tanker elsewhere in the West Bank. The IDF said a ""terrorist driving a Palestinian truck” near the Jewish settlement of Givat Assaf “accelerated towards forces conducting operational activity”. Soldiers and an armed civilian then “neutralised” the driver at the scene, it added. Israeli media posted video footage showing a tanker veering off a busy road at high speed before hitting a bus stop. They also identified the driver as a Palestinian man from Rafat. Rafat’s council leader told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that he knew the driver and did not believe it was an attack, but rather a case of him losing control of the tanker. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. More than 690 Palestinians have been killed, the Palestinian health ministry says, as Israeli forces have intensified their nearly daily search and arrest raids. Israel says it is trying to stem Palestinian attacks in the West Bank and Israel, in which at least 33 Israelis have been killed, according to Israeli authorities. The IDF said in a statement that its troops, along with forces from the Shin Bet internal security agency and Israel Prison Service, had been operating since Tuesday night to ""thwart terror"" in Tubas and Tamun. An air strike killed ""five terrorists armed with explosives who posed a threat to the forces, while the forces on the ground confiscated weapons, dismantled a vehicle rigged with explosives, and hit several armed fighters during exchanges of fire, it added"".  A curfew in Tubas was also imposed on Tubas and that the city's government hospital was surrounded, with people allowed to exit and enter subject to being checked by Israeli forces, according to an Israeli military official. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Wednesday morning that Israeli forces were carrying out large-scale raids on the city’s outskirts and several neighbourhoods. It also said another Israeli military operation was continuing in the city of Tulkarm and its refugee camps for a second day. On Tuesday, the Palestinian health ministry said a Palestinian man and woman had been killed by gunfire from Israeli forces in Tulkarm.  The IDF has not commented on that report, but the statement it put out on Wednesday afternoon said Israeli forces had ""eliminated an armed terrorist and struck several others"" during a counter-terrorism operation in the Tulkarm area. Later, the IDF put out a brief statement saying that an aircraft had conducted an air strike in Tulkarm, without providing any further details. The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had taken the bodies of three Palestinians to a local hospital following a drone strike on a vehicle in a suburb of Tulkarm. Armed groups identified the dead men as fighters, according to Palestinian media reports. The raids come days after the largest Israeli operation in the West Bank since last October. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 36 Palestinians had been killed during the nine-day operation in the Tubas, Tulkarm and Jenin areas. Most of the dead were claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry said children were also among those killed. An Israeli soldier was also killed during the fighting in Jenin. In a separate development on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said Israel had to do more to make sure that incidents like the killing of an American-Turkish activist during a protest in the West Bank last week “never happen again”. The IDF said on Tuesday that it was ""highly likely"" Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was ""hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her"". Mr Biden said the US had confidence in the result of the Israeli investigation but described the killing as “totally unacceptable” and demanded full accountability. An Israeli government spokesman insisted the IDF’s rules of engagement were “extremely clear in preventing any damage to any harm to civilians”."

The IDF said on Tuesday that it was ""highly likely"" Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was ""hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her"". Mr Biden said the US had confidence in the result of the Israeli investigation but described the killing as “totally unacceptable” and demanded full accountability. An Israeli government spokesman insisted the IDF’s rules of engagement were “extremely clear in preventing any damage to any harm to civilians”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lg92edj7o,Palestinian refugee to challenge family reunion bid rejection,"Hadil Lous, who lives in Broughty Ferry, has been trying to reunite with her parents and four siblings.",6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:29:20.766313,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A Palestinian refugee is taking the Home Office to court to challenge its refusal to let her parents and siblings join her in Scotland. Hadil Louz, 32, lives in Broughty Ferry with her husband Ibrahim and eight-month-old daughter Laila. She has been trying to reunite with her parents and four siblings and earlier this year applied to the Home Office for permission to allow them to join her in the UK. But the Home Office rejected the application and said the family had not demonstrated “circumstances which are so compelling as to make them exceptional”. Ms Louz is now appealing against that decision in the Scottish courts. Campaigners are also calling for the introduction of a family reunification scheme for Palestinians, similar to those which were previously introduced for people fleeing Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine. Ms Louz, who has been in the UK since 2018, is studying at St Andrews University as part of a PHD scholarship programme. She currently has protection status as a refugee in the UK but plans to apply for indefinite leave to remain next year, which would make her status permanent if successful. She told BBC Scotland News that she came from “a normal family, living their lives, working and having a simple life in Gaza. “My brothers and sisters were studying at university or high school. They had a peaceful life even if it was interrupted by war.” The attack on Israel by Hamas on 7 October has been followed by a year of conflict. Earlier this year Ms Louz raised £40,000 on the GoFundMe platform to pay for four members of her family to be evacuated from Gaza through the Rafah crossing to Egypt. Her parents are currently in the UAE, where her father is receiving humanitarian treatment for lymphoma cancer, provided by the state. He can remain there while receiving treatment, but may need to return to Egypt when this ends. Five of her siblings are currently living as undocumented immigrants in Egypt and her other two sisters are in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza because she did not have enough funds to secure their passage to Egypt. The Home Office application only applies to her four unmarried siblings in Egypt. Ms Louz said: “The only thing I was able to do was to try and find a way to bring them to safety, so that was my priority. They are all dependent on me, I am the only one that can help them. “Safety is to be surrounded by your family, it’s not to be safe from missiles and bombardments, that’s not the only meaning of safety. “Being deprived of the right of being surrounded by my family, safe and healthy, is really difficult.” Earlier this year she applied to the Home Office for what is known as family reunification protection, in an effort to enable her parents and siblings to join her in the UK. This scheme applies to a partner or dependent child and - in most cases - siblings, the parents of adult children and extended family are not eligible. However, they may also be granted refugee status if they have ""exceptional circumstances"", according to the Home Office. Lawyer Andy Sirel, from human rights law firm JustRightScotland, said he thought the way the Home Office conducted themselves with the family was “unfair and at times unlawful”. He said: “They advised her (Ms Louz) that her family’s circumstances are not exceptional enough and that the suffering they have experienced in Gaza is not above the level of other Palestinians in Gaza. Not only is that not a lawful test, it’s inhumane.” The Scottish Refugee Council is calling for the introduction of a family reunification scheme for Palestinians, similar to that introduced after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 and the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022. The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme allows those who were evacuated to the UK to bring over parents and siblings in “exceptional circumstances”. The Ukrainian Family Scheme, which closed to new applicants earlier this year, also allowed eligible Ukrainian nationals to join family members in the UK for up to three years. Sabir Zazai, the chair of the Scottish Refugee Council, said the UK government had the opportunity to introduce a family scheme and expand the definition of family. “In many cultures family is much wider than just spouses and children,” he said. “I’m from Afghanistan. In my culture looking after my family, my father, my mother and sisters and brothers, is part of my values. “We believe that when people are forced to flee their homes, when their lives are shattered, it takes all parts of society to work together to help them rebuild their lives in safety and dignity.  ""Refugee protection is not about politics, it's about common human decency.” The Home Office said it had a long-standing policy of not commenting on individual cases."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e866ypp1zo,The world’s diamond polishing capital feels Ukraine war impact,Wars and recession in key Western markets have left India's diamond industry workers distraught and jobless.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:20.860584,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Nikunj Tank, a worker in the world’s diamond polishing capital Surat in western India, had been desperate since losing his job in May. The unit he worked at for seven years was facing a financial squeeze and closed down, leaving him and over a dozen others unemployed. Tank was the family’s sole breadwinner - he was supporting his parents, wife and daughter and had no savings. ‘‘He couldn’t find a job and unable to bear the loss, he took the extreme step,” said his retired father Jayanti Tank. Tank died by suicide in August. The last few years have been tough for India’s recession-hit diamond industry. Surat, in Gujarat state, processes 90% of the world’s diamonds in over 5,000 units and employs more than 800,000 polishers. The city has 15 big polishing units with an annual turnover of more than $100m (£75m). India’s exports of cut and polished stones fell from $23bn in 2022 to $16bn in 2023 and are expected to drop further to $12bn in 2024. The price of polished diamonds dipped by 5%,s to 27% in 2023, due to lower demand and oversupply, say analysts. Mahesh Virani of Star Gems explained that oversupply occurred because polishing units continued production despite limited demand to keep operations running, ultimately increasing their losses. The state’s Diamond Workers’ Union, a group representing polishers, told BBC Gujarati that more than 30,000 have lost their jobs in the past six months alone due to the downturn. The union says that as per their data collected from victims’ families, police records and news reports, 65 workers have died by suicide in the state over one-and-a-half years due to this slowdown. The BBC could not independently verify this figure. Experts say the Covid-19 lockdown, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza wars, and falling demand in key markets have adversely impacted India’s diamond industry. “The business of polished diamonds has gone down by more than 25-30% due to global recession,” said Vallabh Lakhani, chairman of Kiran Gems, a leading  manufacturer. India imports 30% of its rough diamonds from Russian mines – now under Western sanctions due to the war – and cuts and polishes them, then sells them mostly in Western markets. In March, the European Union and G7 countries imposed a fresh ban on the import of Russian unpolished diamonds, including those processed in India and sold in the West via third countries. After the fresh ban, India publicly raised concerns, with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stating in April that such measures hurt those lower in the supply chain more than Russia, as producers usually find alternative routes. Traders in Surat echo that. ""India is at the low end of the value chain of the diamond industry. The country is highly dependent on the global market, both for raw materials as well as for final sales,"" said exporter Kirti Shah. Additionally, an economic downturn in G7 countries and the UAE and Belgium - India’s key export destinations – has impacted business. The downturn is also attributed to a rise in demand for lab-grown diamonds, a cheaper alternative to natural diamonds, and to the war in Gaza, as the gems form a sizeable chunk of India's trade with Israel. “The diamond sector in Surat is passing through a bad phase,” said Kumar Kanani, a lawmaker from the state's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said the police were investigating the suicide cases attributed to job losses. ""The government is ready to provide all possible help to polishers, traders and businessmen,” he said. But the families of at least nine workers, who recently took their lives, said they had received little help from the government. The majority of layoffs have occurred in small and medium-sized units, which typically hire workers for quality checks of rough diamonds and for polishing and shaping them. But bigger players are impacted too. Last month, Kiran Gems asked its 50,000 employees to go on a 10-day vacation, citing the slowdown as a reason. In July, the Diamond Workers' Union started a helpline which received over 1,600 distress calls from polishers seeking jobs or financial help. But there have been others who couldn’t get help in time. Vaishali Patel, 38, lost her husband Nitin two years back. The polishing unit he worked for had laid off a majority of its staff because of a lack of business. Brokers and traders too are facing the brunt. “We have been sitting idle for days. There is hardly any sale or purchase,” said Dilip Sojitra, one of the 5,000 brokers in Surat who sell diamonds to customers, traders and other brokers. Lab-grown diamonds, once in high demand, have also seen prices drop from $300 to $78 per carat due to overproduction, impacting the market. Surat Diamond Brokers Association president Nandlal Nakrani believes the situation will improve when rough diamond prices decrease and polished diamond prices rise. Despite the slowdown, some hope the industry will recover, as it did after the 2008 Great Recession, which shut hundreds of polishing units and left thousands jobless. Mr Sojitra says he believes the upcoming festival season, including Diwali, Christmas, and New Year, will help boost business momentum. ""This too shall pass,"" he says."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6q2zwy9j0o,"Trump or Harris? In a crisis-hit world, diplomats resigned to either","Behind the scenes at the United Nations, insiders tell the BBC they don't see major change whoever wins the White House.",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:20.955990,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The annual United Nations General Assembly week is always frenetic.  It may be called the Super Bowl of diplomacy, but this year perhaps a more appropriate analogy is a marathon.  Not since World War Two have there been so many global conflicts piling up, with Lebanon on the brink just as leaders arrived in New York City. Given the current state of uncertainty, the forthcoming US election was in the back of everyone’s minds here. One senior Western diplomat told me no-one expects things to move on the Israel-Gaza war until after a winner is declared in the White House race. “We understand that the current administration is under pressure not to take any decisions that might affect the election,” he said.  “But we hope that after the election the current administration will use the interim period to maybe make some decisions that will lead to improving the situation in Gaza.” But in conversations with a dozen officials from different continents at the UN's headquarters in Manhattan, a picture emerged of a global community fatigued by crisis and resigned to working with whoever is the next occupant of the White House.  All were granted anonymity to share their candid views. ""I don’t see any difference between the two candidates, just look around the whole world from one end to the other, we are in total chaos,"" an ambassador from a South Asian nation told me. It's a sentiment that reflects perhaps disillusionment with US leadership, but also the view by many in the global south that while the rhetoric changes, America’s broad foreign policies really don’t swing that drastically from one administration to the next. “It’s very easy to bash and make alarms about what could happen,” one senior Arab representative told me. He said while he thinks former President Donald Trump is unpredictable compared to Vice-President Kamala Harris, the idea that he would rip up multilateralism is exaggerated because it didn’t happen before. ""What is really undermining multilateralism are actions and conflicts that are happening in many parts of the world, and you can’t put that on one country or on one administration,"" he said. Here at the UN complex, one longtime official of the organisation tells me there isn’t panic about the US election.  ""We have enough anxiety spread around what's going on today to worry about what's going on in November,” the official said. This source added that the UN survived the Trump administration in a way few would have predicted.  ""The volume may have been very loud, but they weren’t all that different from previous Republicans,"" the official said.  If there is a second term, the official told me their sense is that Trump will be so focused on domestic issues and ""settling scores internally"" that foreign policy might not be the focus in the beginning. Speaking to the BBC, Kenyan President William Ruto sounded unfazed. ""I am very confident that the bones of friendship between Kenya and the US transcend individuals in office,"" he said. ""It will transcend me as president or whoever is elected in the US."" For many Europeans, however, there is anxiety about a second Trump administration and what some see as his transactional approach to foreign relations.  A European diplomat told me that with the Security Council incapable of managing conflicts, there is a fear that an emboldened and potentially more radical Trump administration would add to the dysfunction and encourage more movement in Europe toward the ultra-right. “I think it would be a relief for at least the majority of Europeans if Harris comes into office,” he said. Nevertheless, another senior European diplomat said that while Harris winning would give them a sense of continuity, they also now have a relationship from working with Trump for four years and feel more prepared than in 2016. Coinciding with the UN high level debate was Climate Week in New York City. Caribbean leaders spoke not only from the green and gold General Assembly Hall, but also to rooms full of businessmen and politicians at side events to warn that the world is dangerously behind on its climate commitments, putting their islands at risk. One minister from the region told me that climate was the main area where the US candidates’ differences worried them. “In terms of having real commitment from the US government and for the US government to provide leadership,” the minister said it’s ""definitely Democrats"". Many still remember Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, while Joe Biden later rejoined. The Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, said political change has been a challenge to progress over the last 26 years. He said he’s been calling for some kind of mechanism that protects a change in political leadership from impeding or reversing progress. Election day on 5 November may feel faraway to diplomats who have been confronted with more challenges than solutions here this past week.  But the time is fast approaching when votes will be counted in the US, and with it a new face in the White House. Another European minister, running to an event, simply had this to say to me: ""My hope is that it doesn’t get too weird."" Additional reporting by Cai Pigliucci."

Authorities said about 1,200 people took part in Wednesday's demonstration, many of whom carried Palestinian flags and sang pro-Palestinian chants."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjw1ggkpd7o,Israel says 'highly likely' its troops killed US-Turkish protester in West Bank,It says she was probably hit indirectly and unintentionally at a protest in the occupied West Bank.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:21.258326,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Israel military says a US-Turkish woman shot dead at a protest in the occupied West Bank last week was ""highly likely hit indirectly and unintentionally"" by its soldiers. Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, had been at a demonstration against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita last Friday when she was shot by Israeli forces. The US secretary of state called Eygi's killing ""unprovoked and unjustified"", but President Joe Biden later said: ""Apparently it was an accident. It [the bullet] ricocheted off the ground."" Eygi's family, along with the UN human rights office, have called for a full and independent investigation into her killing. In a brief statement summarising their investigation findings, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said the gunfire had not been ""aimed at her, but aimed at the key instigator of the riot."" They added: ""The IDF expresses its deepest regret over the death of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi."" However, the US - Israel's key ally - reacted angrily. Its Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said Israeli forces needed to ""make some fundamental changes in the way that they operate in the West Bank, including changes to their rules of engagement."" He said the IDF’s investigation appeared to support eyewitnesses' testimony that Ms Eygi had been protesting peacefully and thus her killing was “unprovoked and unjustified”. “No-one should be shot and killed for attending a protest, no-one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views,” Blinken told reporters shortly after Israel's release of the findings. Ms Eygi had arrived as a volunteer in the West Bank just a few days before she was killed. Her family has said her life ""was taken needlessly, unlawfully and violently by the Israeli military"".  “A US citizen, Aysenur was peacefully standing for justice when she was killed by a bullet that video shows came from an Israeli military shooter,"" her family said in statement released after her death. Prior to the release of the Israeli report, the US and Turkish governments had condemned Ms Eygi's killing. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branded it as ""barbaric"". In its statement, the IDF said the ""incident"" had taken place during ""a violent riot in which dozens of Palestinian suspects burned tires and hurled rocks toward security forces at the Beita Junction."" But the protest group which Eygi had been with at the time dismissed claims it threw rocks at Israeli soldiers, saying such assertions were “false”. They said their protest had been peaceful. Witnesses and other protesters at the demonstration have also said while there were some clashes with Israeli soldiers, Eygi had not been near that area when she was hit. Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli activist who was at the same protest as Eygi, said he heard two gun shots. He told the BBC's Newshour programme  there had been ""no stone throwing"" at Ms Eygi's location. It had been her first time attending a protest in the West Bank, he said. She had been with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a pro-Palestinian organisation which takes part in weekly demonstrations at Beita against Israeli settlements. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx9znxl4eo,"Israeli strike in Gaza humanitarian zone kills 19, Hamas-run health ministry says",The Israeli military says it struck “senior Hamas terrorists” operating there - a claim hamas denied.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:21.355692,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 19 people have been killed in an overnight Israeli strike in the designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Witnesses said the strike obliterated an area crowded with tents for displaced Palestinians in al-Mawasi, south-west of Khan Younis, leaving huge craters in the sand. “The bombing was incredibly intense. People were thrown into the air,” one displaced man told the BBC. “You can’t imagine the devastation.” The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked what it called “a number of senior Hamas terrorists” operating there - a claim Hamas denied. The military also disputed the initial death toll put out by the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority, which reported that rescue teams had recovered more than 40 bodies. Hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter in the humanitarian zone - which spans only about 41 sq km (16 sq miles) along Gaza's southern Mediterranean coast - after being told by the Israeli military to evacuate there for their own safety over the past 11 months. Living conditions inside the area are dire. The UN says it lacks critical infrastructure and basic services, while aid provision is limited due to access and security issues. Eyewitnesses said large explosions rocked al-Mawasi shortly after midnight local time on Tuesday (21:00 GMT on Monday). Khaled Mahmoud, a volunteer for a charity who lives near the site of the strike, told the BBC that he had been stunned by the scale of the destruction. ""The strikes created three craters 7m [23ft] deep and buried more than 20 tents,"" he said. Aya Madi, a displaced mother of seven from the southern city of Rafah, told a freelance journalist working for the BBC: “We woke up to nothing but sand and fire.  ""My children were screaming, and the tent collapsed on them. I pulled them out from under the rubble. “I held my two-month-old son, thinking he was dead, covered in sand, barely breathing. I washed him and thanked God he was still alive.” She said all of those killed were civilians, adding that there was “not a single resistance fighter”. “All that remains is dust and ashes,” she added. “Some of [the casualties] were torn in parts, other they had to dig to find, some were found in people’s houses... The scene is terrifying.” Saib, a 12-year-old boy from Bani Suheila, told BBC Arabic that ""the screams of people filled the place"" after the explosions stopped. “I rushed with my father to help the people and put out the fire. We put out the fire with sand and then we entered the tents where we found burned children and people torn to pieces,” he said.  “This is the first time since the war began that I have seen such horrific scenes.” Another woman, Aisha Nafi al-Shaeri, said: ""It was all tents of displaced people. And now everything is destroyed."" “They told people to stay here, but there is no safe area,"" she added. ""They didn’t warn anyone. Everyone was sleeping, and suddenly they started shelling.” The Civil Defence’s operations director said overnight that more than 40 people were killed and more than 60 others were injured.  Later on Monday, the nearby Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said 13 people killed in the strike had been brought there. An emergency physician at the hospital, Dr Mohammed al-Qudra, told BBC Arabic that it was also treating 60 injured people, 40 of whom were in a critical condition. ""Most of the injuries that arrived at the hospital were third-degree burns and amputations,"" he said. He also warned that the hospital lacked medical equipment and supplies to treat them, and that there was even a shortage of sheets for their beds. In the afternoon, the Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that hospitals had received a total of 19 bodies and more than 60 wounded people, some of whom were in a serious condition. It did not say how many were men, women or children. Rescuers were unable to reach a number of other victims still buried under sand and rubble, or on roads, the ministry added. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted “a precise strike on a number of senior Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the humanitarian area”. They included Samer Abu Daqqa, head of Hamas’s aerial unit, and Osama Tabesh, head of the observation and targets department in Hamas's military intelligence headquarters, it added. “Prior to the strike, extensive intelligence gathering was conducted, as well as continuous aerial surveillance in the hours leading up to the strike, which confirmed the presence of the terrorists in the area alongside additional terrorist operatives,” it said, adding that casualty numbers put out by Hamas-run authorities did “not align"" with its information. The IDF accused Hamas of embedding its operatives and military infrastructure in the humanitarian zone and using civilians as human shields. A Hamas statement denounced the strike on al-Mawasi as a “heinous massacre” and rejected the IDF’s claim that it had a command centre there. ""This is a clear lie that aims to justify these ugly crimes. The resistance has denied several times that any of its members exist within civilian gatherings or use these places for military purposes,” it said. UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland condemned the strike on a densely-populated area where displaced people were sheltering. “I underline that international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack, must be upheld at all times,” he said. “I also emphasize that civilians must never be used as human shields.” He also urged Israel and Hamas to immediately agree a deal that would for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. An estimated 1.9 million people - more than 80% of the population - are estimated to have been displaced by the war, and some have had to flee as many as 10 times. UN agencies and their partners are currently trying to stop the spread of polio in the overcrowded camps with poor sanitation where many of them are living. The World Health Organization said the third phase of its vaccination campaign began in northern Gaza on Tuesday, after 446,000 children were inoculated in the centre and south earlier this month during localised pauses in the fighting agreed by Israel and Hamas. On Monday, a team of 12 UN staff members on their way to the north to support the campaign was stopped by Israeli troops at a checkpoint for more than seven hours, according to UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator Muhannad Hadi. “While at the checkpoint the team was informed that the IDF wanted to hold two of the UN staff members in the convoy for further questioning,” he said. ""The situation escalated quickly, with soldiers pointing their weapons directly towards the convoy personnel. Live shots were fired, and tanks and bulldozers approached, engaged with, and damaged UN vehicles, endangering the lives of UN staff inside the vehicles."" The two staff were eventually questioned and then released following the intervention of senior UN officials to de-escalate the situation, he added. The IDF said its forces had intelligence that a number of Palestinian suspects were present in the convoy, and that they delayed the convoy in order to question them.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ek10rg74jo,US ambassador’s mural visit halted by Gaza protest,Protesters unfurled Palestinian flags in Shoreditch where the US ambassador had been due to attend.,7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:29:21.454937,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A group of pro-Palestinian protesters have disrupted an event to showcase a new climate mural in east London where the United States ambassador was due to appear. Jane Hartley was en route to see the work in Shoreditch on Monday morning but was diverted after the demonstrators arrived on the scene. About 25 people turned up at the site of the mural, where they unveiled banners critical of US policy on Israel and waved Palestinian flags. The ambassador told BBC London the 7 October anniversary was a "" very sad day"" and that she believed ""in the right to protest and for free speech"". The mural, entitled Rise Above Earth Justice, is the work of artist and activist Shepard Fairey, most famous for his 2008 Obama ""Hope"" poster.  Asked if she thought it was an appropriate day to unveil the mural, Hartley said: ""When planned, it was because Shepard was finishing the mural and we wanted to announce it during Frieze Week, because we thought it was an example of what art should be doing: getting communities involved, bringing communities together. ""We want to get the hostages home; we feel for these families that have suffered such pain. We want a ceasefire and we want humanitarian aid going in to help the people - children, babies, families,"" the ambassador told the BBC. Fairey created the mural at the suggestion of Hartley, who was appointed as the US ambassador to the UK by President Joe Biden in July 2022. The mural, which was inspired by a series of workshops held earlier this year with young people from London, aims to highlight the importance of climate awareness. Fairey said the mural, which features a 50ft (15m) flower, uses symbols to convey the message that it is ""within our power to rise above the injustice of environmental irresponsibility and push for a more healthy planet"". The artist said: ""I believe that our individual and collective actions will dramatically impact current and future generations, be it for the better or for the worse. It is our responsibility as the citizens of Earth to protect it."" The project was produced by Migrate Art, which donate profits to groups supporting marginalised and displaced individuals and communities across the globe. It was also produced by Charlotte Pyatt and Simon Butler and was funded by the Ford Foundation, with support from the US embassy.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xejx07exro,Michigan Arab-Americans 'can't stomach' Harris stance on Gaza,Arab-American voters in swing states like Michigan could decide who wins the US presidential election,21 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:29.130972,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At the Sahara Restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan, four Arabic language TV news channels are beaming in images of the war in Gaza and the aftermath of the recent  pager and radio devices explosions in Lebanon.  The smell of cardamom-infused coffee and shawarma and falafel, and hum of friends catching up, stand in stark contrast to the images on the television screens. Dearborn is the first Arab-majority city in the US, and it has served as a key centre for the ""uncommitted"" movement that is opposed to the Biden administration's policy toward the Middle East.  Because they are in Michigan - a key Midwestern swing state that Joe Biden won by fewer than three points in 2020 - Dearborn voters, like those who frequent the Sahara Restaurant, could decide Kamala Harris's political future.  Sam Hammoud, whose family has run the Sahara Restaurant in Dearborn for the past 30 years, said that taxes and inflation have negatively affected his business - but it's not what is motivating his vote. He is currently an undecided voter.  “It’s about the situation in our homelands,” he said. “We need a ceasefire. There is no ceasefire. We have no more words,” he added.  Mr Hammoud's feelings are shared by many here, and the Arab-American community has been sounding the alarm bell to Democrats for months, warning the party that its loyal support could not be automatically counted on this election. In a statement this week, the Uncommitted Movement - which is made up of traditionally Democratic members - said it could not endorse Harris because of her “unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing US and international human rights law”.  Soujoud Hamade is a lawyer in the Detroit suburb and president of the Michigan Chapter of the Arab American Bar Association.  She canvassed for the Democratic Party in past elections, and feels her work helped get President Biden elected in 2020. He won Michigan with a margin of just 2.78%. This time around, Ms Hamade is voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. She is not alone. An August poll from the Council on American-Islamic Relations indicates that in Michigan, 40% of Muslim voters back Stein, 18% preferred Republican Donald Trump - and only 12% supported Harris - suggesting a significant shift from past strong support for Democrats.  Ms Hamade said the ""traditionally"" Democratic Arab-American voters in Michigan “cannot stomach the thought of voting for someone who's directly contributing to the death and destruction of our home country and of our relatives overseas”.  Harris welcoming the endorsement of former Republican Vice-President Dick Cheney was particularly troubling for the Michigan lawyer. She said Cheney’s involvement in the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 makes him an unwanted bedfellow for her community. “It's baffling to me as an American, to now see the direction that the party is going, it's disheartening,"" she said.  ""These aren't the values that we as Democrats stood for. We were not the party of war."" Packed full of cafes, restaurants and independently owned stores, Dearborn enjoys a thriving small-business economy - as well as a strong community that is deeply affected by the conflict in the Middle East.  Dr Maisa Hider-Beidoun, who owns a chain of pharmacies and medical centres in the region, said she is a lifelong Democrat who does not know if she can support Harris.  Her community has been placed in ""a moral dilemma”, she said. “We are good Americas, we are good tax-paying, law-abiding citizens, but our money is being funnelled overseas and killing people that are actually physically related to us.""  In February's Democratic primary in Michigan, part of the process of choosing the party's presidential candidate, over 100,000 people in this community declared themselves ""uncommitted"" in protest at the Biden-Harris administration policy towards Gaza.  The community says it has sought meetings with the White House and asked the vice-president to outline how her approach to Israel might differ from Biden's.  While the Uncommitted Movement criticised Harris, it also opposes Trump, whose “agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organising”, it says. The organisation did not recommend its members vote for a third-party candidate like Stein. While Trump has been critical at times of Israel's handling of the war, he has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel. He has condemned pro-Palestinian protests and as president, angered Palestinians by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. He has said the war would not have happened if he were president but has said little on his plans to end the conflict.  Dr Mona Mawari, a pharmacist and a community organiser who worked on the uncommitted campaign, told the BBC she is still struggling to decide how to vote in November - “a really hard decision”.  Harris is “maybe a little more empathetic with her words” than Biden regarding what Dr Mawari describes as “genocide” in Gaza, but she finds it hard to support her. Harris has said she is aligned with Biden on US support for Israel though she has spoken more about the scale of the human suffering in Gaza.  Said Dr Mawari: “The community is really upset, and they're very hyper-aware that lip service is just lip service, and without any actions they can't vote for her.""  The situation in Lebanon has also sharpened fears about an escalation in the regional conflict and, for this Arab-American community, what it means for their families there.  Faye Nemer came to the US when she was 10, fleeing Lebanon because of the political instability and violence, and she is now the CEO of the Middle East North American Arab Chamber of Commerce. Before her family left Lebanon, she says they were “living as refugees” in their own country, moving between “abandoned office buildings”.  So she looks at the situation in Gaza - where more than a million people have been displaced - through a different lens, particularly the experience of children.  Her sister and much of her extended family are still in Lebanon.  “It's difficult to conduct your day-to-day without that being top of mind,” she said.  A lifelong Democrat, she has also not made up her mind on how - or if - she will vote, and is also weighing voting for a third-party candidate. Some 3.5 million Americans claimed Middle Eastern descent in the 2020 Census -around 1% of the population, though many are concentrated in battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Dr Mawari said the uncommitted movement doesn't want people to feel apathetic and not cast a ballot, but to use their vote in whichever way they believe is right.  ""Sitting this one out is not an option. It's not an answer to what's going on,” she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qexxqdxvdo,Three Israelis shot dead at West Bank-Jordan crossing,Israeli officials say a gunman approached from the Jordanian side and opened fire.,8 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:29.242609,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Three Israeli men have been shot dead at a border point between Jordan and the occupied West Bank, Israeli officials say. The gunman - identified by the Israeli military as Jordanian Maher Jazi - approached the Allenby Bridge crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck then got out and opened fire, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Security personnel ""eliminated"" the gunman and the IDF checked the truck over for signs of explosives, a statement said. Jordan says it is investigating the incident, which happened in an Israeli-controlled area where Jordanian vehicles offload goods entering the West Bank. The border point has now been closed from both sides. Israeli media reported the victims were named Yohanan Shchori, 61, Yuri Birnbaum, 65, and Adrian Marcelo Podzamczer, whose age was not given. The three men were said to be guards working at the border crossing, but were not military or police. Kan News, Israel's state broadcaster, reported that Jazi was a 39-year-old who had worked as a truck driver. Video footage showed the attacker walking to the terminal and firing his weapon three times before he was shot dead. A Jordanian border official told Reuters that at least two dozen Jordanian truck drivers in the offloading area had been detained by Israel's military for interrogation. All of Israel's land crossings with Jordan have been closed after the incident, the Israel Airports Authority said.  The Allenby Bridge crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, lies about halfway between Amman and Jerusalem and is the only official crossing point between the West Bank and Jordan. It is also the only entry point to the West Bank that does not go through Israel. Jordan and Israel maintain security, trade and diplomatic ties - though Jordan is critical of Israel’s actions towards Palestinians. Dozens of trucks cross from Jordan daily to supply goods for markets in both the West Bank and Israel. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a ""hard day"" and sent his condolences to the victims' families at the start of a cabinet meeting. He added: ""A loathsome terrorist murdered three of our citizens in cold blood at the Allenby Bridge."" Hamas officials did not claim responsibility for the attack, but described it as a ""natural response"" to the war in Gaza.  The Palestinian health ministry says more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in West Bank violence since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. During the same period, at least 18 Israelis were killed in West Bank violence, according to United Nations (UN) figures, which do not include deaths since 11 August.  Last week, Israeli forces withdrew from Jenin city and its refugee camp - an area in the West Bank - after a major nine-day operation there. The area is a stronghold of militants and has a civilian population of about 60,000. Israel says it is trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel, and acting against terrorism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgry10924jqo,How worried should I be about rising oil prices?,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched.",4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:29.320353,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"As the conflict across the Middle East widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched. The cost of oil affects everything from the price of food at the supermarket to how much it costs to fill up your car. The price of crude oil has risen almost 10% this week to around $78 a barrel as the conflict has intensified.  That may seem like a big jump, but the price of crude oil tends to be volatile, and in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a barrel of benchmark Brent crude hit almost $130. The uptick comes as many countries, including the UK, are just beginning to recover from the sharp rise in oil prices after the Covid pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. So how worried should we be? Crude oil is a key ingredient in petrol and diesel, meaning higher oil prices could drive up prices at the pumps just when they've just hit their lowest level for three years. If a company delivering goods, such as food, is hit by higher fuel costs, it is also likely to raise its prices. These increased costs could then be passed on by supermarkets selling the food to us, the consumer. The cost of living goes up. ""Everything we go and buy in the shop has been transported around and has been made from things that have been transported around. The increase in fuel costs tends to filter into everything,"" Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec, tells the BBC. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, which sets interest rates, has warned the conflict in the Middle East has the potential to have a ""very serious"" impact on the UK. Mr Bailey said he was watching developments ""extremely closely"". This comes as he signalled interest rates are on the path downwards, and the UK's prospects on inflation - which has come down after being driven up by high oil and gas prices in 2022 - are looking brighter. Yet so far a rise to about $78 a barrel is not the time for alarm bells. If the ""worst-case scenario"" of further escalation does not materialise, oil prices are likely to ""ease back quite quickly"", says Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. Iran is the world's seventh largest oil exporter, with half of its exports going to China. If supplies were disrupted, China could turn to Russia. But Ms Bain warns markets are ""finely balanced"", and if the conflict escalates, ""taking out a medium-sized supplier like Iran would lead to a spike in prices"". She says there is ""more than enough capacity"" globally to cover the gap if Iranian production is lost, but there is the question of where Saudi Arabia's ""loyalty will lie"" as the world's second largest oil producer and whether it will increase or restrict further production. Mr Macpherson says if Israel did decide to attack Iran's oil sector, a rise in the price of Brent crude could increase the cost of filling up at the pumps ""quite quickly"".  He explains that this scenario could threaten general inflation in the UK, which could in turn influence any decision from the Bank of England to lower interest rates. However, he also points out ""there might not ultimately be any disruption to supply"" at all. The direct impact of Iran's oil production is not the only concern.  There is a risk that any escalation in the region could block the Strait of Hormuz, a relatively narrow channel through which a huge amount of oil tanker traffic passes -about a third of total seaborne-traded oil. It is also the path through which a fifth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is transported, a commodity that the world has become more dependent on since sanctions were imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Asia is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, and the immediate impact of an escalation would be significant. Disruption to LNG shipments from one of the world's biggest exporters in Qatar would lead to higher gas prices - which could in turn lead to a rise in household gas and electricity bills. As with oil, gas prices filter down supply chains, affecting the cost of virtually all goods. UK energy bills have risen 10% for this winter, but are currently predicted to fall slightly in January. This forecast could change of course, if an escalation to the conflict in the Middle East affects global gas supplies, and leads to higher prices. But Ms Bain says the risk of strait being blocked as a result of the conflict is small. And if it does transpire, Mr Macpherson adds the effect on the UK would be minimal, given that most of Europe's gas is supplied mainly from Norway. There are a lot of possible outcomes, but in terms of what will happen with oil prices in the coming weeks and months, ""nobody knows"", Mr Macpherson admits.  There's a ""wide spectrum"" of what could come next, he adds, but ""there is really no way of telling where we will be this time next week""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nrd730jdo,"Israeli strikes on Syrian military sites kill 18, health minister says",The Israeli military has not commented on the strikes on around the central town of Masyaf.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:29.406406,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 18 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on a number of military sites in central Syria, the Syrian health minister says. State news agency Sana cited Hassan al-Ghabbash as saying another 37 people were injured in the attacks in the vicinity of Masyaf, in Hama province, on Sunday night. A UK-based monitoring group reported that 26 people were killed and that the targets included a scientific research centre near Masyaf that was used to develop weapons. The Israeli military said it would not comment on foreign media reports of the strikes, which Syria's foreign ministry condemned as ""blatant aggression"" and Iran's foreign ministry called a ""criminal attack"". However, Israel has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran - Israel's main foe - and allied armed groups. The Israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in Gaza in October last year, in response to cross-border attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon and Syria. Sana's report cited a Syrian military source as saying that Israeli aircraft flying over north-western Lebanon launched missiles at “a number of military sites in the central region” at around 23:20 (20:20 GMT) on Sunday.  ""Our air defence shot down some missiles,” the military source added. The news agency said the strikes also caused damage to the Masyaf-Wadi al-Oyoun highway and that a fire broke out in the forested Hair Abbas area. Later, the Syrian foreign ministry said the attack had targeted ""several residential areas"", while local authorities reported that key infrastructure had been damaged, including a fibre optic cable running underneath the highway and a high-voltage power line, according to Sana. State-run Al-Ikhbariya al-Suriyah TV also broadcast footage purportedly showing a damaged building in the port city of Tartous, west of Masyaf. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground - reported that Israeli strikes destroyed buildings and military facilities in ""the scientific research area in Masyaf"", on the Masyaf-Wadi al-Oyoun highway and in Hair Abbas. It said at least 26 people were killed, including five civilians, four members of Syrian government forces and 14 Syrians working with pro-Iran groups. Another three bodies were unidentified, it added. The SOHR said Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers had been stationed in the scientific research area for six years as part of a programme to develop short- and medium-range precision missiles and drones. However, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told reporters in Tehran: “We do not confirm what was reported by media outlets linked to the Zionist regime [Israel] about an attack on an Iranian centre or a centre under Iran's protection.” A senior regional military source close to Damascus and Tehran also denied a Reuters news agency report which cited two intelligence sources as saying that a major military research centre for chemical arms production was hit several times. Western intelligence agencies have previously alleged that a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) near Masyaf has been used to produce chemical weapons in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Syrian government has denied the claim. However, the facility was reportedly targeted in a suspected Israeli strike in September 2017, a day after a deadly chemical attack on a rebel-held town in northern Syria that the UN and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded was carried out by the Syrian air force. According to the SOHR, Israeli air and artillery strikes have targeted Syrian territory on 64 occasions since the start of the year, resulting in the damage or destruction of about 140 targets, including weapons depots, vehicles and Iran-backed militia headquarters. The strikes have killed at least 208 fighters - including 46 members of Syrian government forces, 43 members of Hezbollah and 24 Iranian Revolutionary Guards - as well as 22 civilians, the monitoring group says. In April, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an air strike on a consulate building in Damascus which killed two senior Revolutionary Guards commanders.  Iran retaliated by carrying out its first direct military attack against Israel. It launched 300 missiles and drones, but almost all of them were shot down by Israeli and US-led forces."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04p7q3k4k9o,Surgeon 'became robotic' to treat sheer volume of wounded Lebanese,"Elias Jaradeh worked for almost 24 hours on the wounded, many of whom lost eyes or the use of their hands.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:29.480483,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A Lebanese surgeon has described how the sheer volume of severe wounds from two days of exploding device attacks forced him to act ""robotic"" just to be able to keep working. Surgeon Elias Jaradeh said he treated women and children but most of the patients he saw were young men. The surgeon said a large proportion were “severely injured” and many had lost the sight in both eyes. The dead and injured in Lebanon include fighters from Hezbollah – the Iranian backed armed group which has been trading cross-border fire with Israel for months and is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US.  But members of their families have also been killed or wounded, along with innocent bystanders. Elias Jaradeh described the wounded he treated as looking ""mostly civilian"". The bomb attacks – which killed 37 people including two children – have been widely blamed on Israel, which has not claimed responsibility. Warning: This report contains graphic details Dr Jaradeh, who is also an MP for the Change parliamentary bloc, was working at a specialist eye and ear hospital where some of the most severely wounded people were sent. He said it had taken a toll on the medical teams, himself included. ""And, yes, it's very hard,"" the surgeon said. ""You have to dissociate yourself. More or less, you are robotic. This is the way you have to behave, but inside, you are deeply injured. You are seeing the nation injured."" Surgeons like Dr Jaradeh worked for almost 24 hours continuously on the wounded, many of whom have lost their eyesight or the use of their hands, the country's health minister told the BBC. Eye specialist Prof Elias Warrak told BBC Arabic that in one night he extracted more damaged eyes than he had previously in his entire career. ""It was very hard,"" he said. ""Most of the patients were young men in their twenties and in some cases I had to remove both eyes. In my whole life I had not seen scenes similar to what I saw yesterday."" Health Minister Firass Abiad told the BBC the victims' injuries would prove life-changing. “This is something that unfortunately will require a lot of rehabilitation,” he said. About 3,200 people were injured, most of them in Tuesday's attack which saw thousands of pagers detonated.  Wednesday's attack, which detonated two-way radio devices, wounded about 450 people but was responsible for 25 deaths, twice as many as in Tuesday's blasts.  Abiad told the BBC the attacks constituted a war crime. “The whole world could see that these attacks occurred in markets,” he said.  “These were not people who were at the battleground fighting. They were in civilian areas with their families.” Witnesses described seeing people with severe wounds to their faces and hands after the attacks. Journalist Sally Abou al-Joud says she saw patients ""covered in blood"" at hospitals, where ambulances were arriving ""one after the other within the minute"". Most injuries she saw were ""in the faces and the eyes"". ""We’re talking about hands injured, severely injured fingers torn, I’ve heard some doctors say we need to perform amputation surgeries to remove hands... they need to perform surgeries for eyes to remove them,"" she said. One woman told BBC Arabic on Thursday that what they had seen was a ""massacre in every sense of the world"". ""Young men were walking in the street with injuries to their hands, waist and eyes... they were unable to see anything,"" she said. In the aftermath of Tuesday's blasts, writer and politician Tracy Chamoun said she saw one man with his eye blown out and another ""had half of his face ripped off"". She had been driving in southern Beirut - a Hezbollah stronghold - at the time. Many Lebanese in Beirut say the device attacks have reignited their trauma from the Beirut port explosion four years ago.  At least 200 people were killed and 5,000 injured when thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at a warehouse in the port blew up, sending a mushroom cloud into the air and a supersonic blastwave tearing through the city. ""We remembered such painful scenes... it is something truly terrifying,"" one woman told BBC Arabic. ""A state of confusion, discomfort and anxiety is dominating all Lebanon... what happened to us four years ago is being repeated now.”  In the aftermath of the exploding pagers and radio devices the Lebanese army has been destroying suspicious devices with controlled detonations, while walkie-talkies and pagers have now been banned onboard all flights operating at Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport - the only operational commercial airport in Lebanon. More than 90 of those injured are now in Iran receiving further treatment, according to Tehran's embassy in Lebanon. That includes Iran's ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, whose condition has been described as ""very good"" by the embassy in its statement. Officials didn't elaborate on how serious the injuries suffered by the other transferees were. Abiad said the ""weaponisation of technology” was something very serious, he said, not only for Lebanon but also for the rest of the world, and for other conflicts.  “Now we have to think twice before using technology,” he said. On Thursday Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah described the device attacks as a ""massacre"" and a ""declaration of war"" as Israel carried out air strikes on southern Lebanon and jets flew over the capital at low altitude, creating a deafening noise. The Shia Muslim organisation is a major political presence and controls the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. It has been trading near-daily cross border fire with Israel since Israel began its retaliation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian group attacked southern Israel last October. Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has said it is changing its military focus to its border with Lebanon, with the aim of returning tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes. Hezbollah has previously said it would stop firing if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both Dr Jaradeh and Health Minister Abiad are pessimistic about the chances of peace any time soon. Dr Jaradeh described the escalation in Lebanon as a ""rebound effect"". ""I think whatever happens, it doesn't matter how you end up the world, but if you don't reach a peace, permanent peace process, that protecting everyone and giving the right to everyone, so we are preparing to another war,"" he said. Abiad said Lebanon needed to prepare for the ""worst-case scenario"". ""The two attacks in the last day, show that their intent (Israel) is not towards a diplomatic solution,"" he said. ""What I know is the position of my government is clear. From day one, we believe that Lebanon does not want war.” Additional reporting by Carine Torbey in Beirut"

The Royal Exchange in Manchester scrapped its entire five-week run of a modern retelling of the Shakespeare play, reportedly in a dispute over references to the Israel-Gaza war and trans rights. The theatre insisted it wanted ""to work with artists who address complex issues"" but the play faced ""a number of challenges"". It said a review would now look into the whole production, including the commissioning, research and development process, as well as the rehearsal stages, with a view to learning lessons for the future. Arts union Equity previously said it was ""deeply frustrated"" at a perceived lack of transparency over the cancellation, and said it was speaking to theatre bosses to ""protect the principle of artistic freedom"". The Manchester Evening News reported that the show, set in the city's present-day rave scene, was axed after managers objected to a song with lyrics that referred to trans rights and the phrase ""free Palestine"". Theatre news outlet The Stage said one of the points of contention was ""free Palestine"" being daubed on the set as well as featuring in a rap. Director Stef O’Driscoll told the outlet the situation left the show’s company feeling “devalued, invisible, problematic and unsafe”. Ms O’Driscoll said executive staff stated that the production could not go on unless the phrases “trans rights” and “Free Palestine” were removed.  She said there was ""a lack of proper and rigorous artistic support"" and she felt that what happened was not an ""isolated incident but reflects a growing trend of censorship and fear-driven decision-making in the arts"". ""As artists, we are losing the very spaces that are meant to challenge, provoke and speak to the issues of our time,"" she said. ""In this instance, it is profoundly concerning and distressing that theatre artists have not been allowed to speak freely on a major UK stage."" A theatre representative said the production company had been invited to participate in the review and the theatre was ""open to exploring future collaborations"". ""We do not censor artistic voices, however challenging they may be,"" they said. ""Collaboration and feedback are a key part of our process, ensuring we develop world class theatre for everyone."" The theatre said ""a wide range of issues"" led to the cancellation, including injuries to actors, new elements to the content and logistical problems ""Elements introduced to A Midsummer Night’s Dream at a late stage were not embedded into the script,"" the representative said. ""Complex issues that deeply affect many of our audience members lacked context within the wider narrative of the production. ""These additions included audience participation, and a call and response towards the end of the play. ""We have no issue with artists putting forward political views, but they need to be fully contextualised.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kjrr44mvdo,"Religious hate crime at record high, figures show","The Israel-Hamas war has led to an increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents, the Home Office says.",4 days ago,2024-10-14 18:29:29.644782,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Religious hate crime recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by 25% over the past year, driven by a rise in offences against Jews and Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Home Office figures show. The vast majority of the 140,561 hate crime offences recorded - about seven in 10 - are shown to have been motivated by race, according to the data. But the increase in religious hate crimes is mainly driven by a rise in antisemitic offences, the department said. Hate crimes targeted at Jewish people more than doubled, while incidents against Muslims were up 13% on the previous 12 months, according to data. The Home Office said this is the highest annual count in religious hate crime offences since the department began collecting data in the year ending March 2012. More recent figures, recorded by community organisations rather than police, have shown record highs in antisemitism and Islamophobia up to the end of September. Publishing the statistics on Thursday, the Home Office said the 25% increase ""was driven by a rise in hate crimes against Jewish people and to a lesser extent Muslims and has occurred since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict"". The hate crimes figures, supplied to the Home Office by the 43 territorial police forces across England and Wales and British Transport Police, showed a 5% decline in the overall number of hate crimes. But over the year ending March 2024 there were 3,282 religious hate crimes targeting Jews, more than double the previous year (1,543). The spike in such incidents coincided with the start of the conflict in the Middle East, and though the number decreased, by the spring it had not returned to levels identified before the conflict. The data corresponds to what has been reported by Jewish charities over the past year, with the highest number of offences reported in Greater London. Jewish charity the Community Security Trust (CST) said the 5,583 incidents recorded across the UK between 7 October 2023 and 30 September is the highest total of any 12-month period and was three times that of the previous 12-month period, which saw 1,830 incidents recorded. The figures also show there were 3,866 religious hate crimes targeting Muslims, up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year. It means 38% of recorded religious hate crimes were targeted against Muslims, and the figures do not yet include the unrest following events in Southport in the summer. Tell Mama - which records anti-Muslim incidents - said it had recorded 4,971 incidents of hate and discrimination across the UK in the year since the 7 October 2023 attacks, the highest total it had noted in more than a decade. ""The appalling levels of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes outlined in today’s figures are a stain on our society, and this government will work tirelessly to tackle this toxic hatred wherever it is found,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. ""We must not allow events unfolding in the Middle East to play out in increased hatred and tension here on our streets and those who push this poison - offline or online - must face the full force of the law,"" she said. The police numbers do show that there were decreases in recorded disability hate crimes (down 18%) and those targeting people for their sexual orientation (down 8%), and a 2% fall in transgender hate crimes. But they also show that while there was a 5% fall in race hate crimes, 98,799 were still recorded over 12 months, and it remains by far the most common motivation in such offenses. Hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation have fallen for the second year in a row to 22,839 reported incidents. It means that these types of hate crime have fallen a total of 13% since March 2022 - which was the highest number on record. The Home Office says these decreases have been driven by falls in malicious communications offences, as well as reports of incidents causing public fear, alarm or distress. Simon Blake, CEO of LGBT campaigning charity Stonewall, told BBC News that hate crime reported to police ""is only part of the picture"". He said: ""It’s vital that all those affected have access to support. The fight against hatred is shared, so we must work together to build a society where everyone is safe and respected and free from harm."" Danielle St James, chief executive of trans charity Not A Phase, told the BBC that trans people are often reluctant to report hate crimes. She said: ""After many years in which hate crimes against trans people have soared, the news that these are down by 2% is certainly welcome. ""That being said, we know all too well that there is a reluctance to report these crimes on the part of the community, so it’s always worth taking stats such as these with a pinch of salt."""

Hungarian-born Lily Ebert, who lived in north-west London, was taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944 with her family when she was 20. Her story went viral four years ago when she tried to find out more about the American soldier who liberated her from a death march in Germany.  The King is among those who paid tribute to Ms Ebert, praising her ""extraordinary resilience and courage"". Ms Ebert had been determined to reach as many people to share her experiences, which led her to embrace social media.  King Charles wrote: ""As a survivor of the unmentionable horrors of the Holocaust, I am so proud that she later found a home in Britain where she continued to tell the world of the horrendous atrocities she had witnessed, as a permanent reminder of the depths of depravity and evil to which humankind can fall, when reason, compassion and truth are abandoned."" She answered questions and explained the ordeal to younger generation, and with the help of her great-grandson, Dov, she gained two million followers on TikTok.  Ms Ebert's great-grandson, Dov Forman, wrote on X: ""[Her] story touched hundreds of millions worldwide, reminding us of the resilience of the human spirit and the dangers of unchecked hatred. ""She was the queen of our large, loving family. ""A light that shone so brightly has gone dark. She was our hero"". Labour MP Wes Streeting said: ""What an extraordinary life and example to all of us"", the National Jewish Assembly described her as ""a remarkable woman"", and the London Victims' Commissioner said: ""I am so sorry to read this sad news.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly311el04go,"Hate crime rise abhorrent, Sadiq Khan says","The mayor is urging Londoners to be united against hate, as the conflict in the Middle East deepens.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:29.802930,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Sadiq Khan has urged Londoners to remain united “against all forms of hate” as the conflict in the Middle East deepens. The mayor has announced a further £875,000 investment in grass-roots community projects working to tackle hate, extremism and radicalisation. The funding comes just ahead of the first anniversary of the outbreak of war in Gaza on 7 October. “We know that an escalation in conflict in the Middle East often leads to an increase in hate crime here in London,” Mr Khan said at an event bringing together organisations that work to combat hate crime and extremism. “With the appalling further escalation of the conflict in Lebanon, Israel, Gaza and the region, I’m appealing to Londoners to continue to look out for their friends and neighbours, whatever their faith and backgrounds, and stand united against all forms of hate. “We have seen an abhorrent and completely unacceptable rise in hate crime over the last year – particularly antisemitism and Islamophobia – which has profoundly impacted our Jewish and Muslim communities in London. ""I’m determined to continue to work in partnership with community, faith and police leaders to ensure everyone in the capital feels safe and is safe.” The Met Police recorded a 286% rise in antisemitic hate crime from September 2023 to August, compared to the same period in the 12 months before, and a 67% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime. The need for early intervention to prevent radicalisation was highlighted earlier this month, when Home Office data revealed that a record number of children were arrested as terror suspects in the year to June. Police detained 242 people on suspicion of terror offences during the 12-month period, of whom 40 were aged 17 or under.  According to City Hall, the £875,000 investment will support 20 groups, among them the Anne Frank Trust UK, to deliver workshops that challenge anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate. Another recipient of funding is Exit Hate, which works with people aged 14-18 to help them understand the dangers posed by extreme ideologies. The latest funding package forms part of the mayor’s Shared Endeavour Fund, and is expected to benefit about 50,000 Londoners. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: “Our work, which is underpinned by engagement with community representatives and with our key partners, will continue.  ""Together, we are determined to demonstrate that there will be no tolerance for hate crime in London.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewlqpk9e99o,Satellite images show how Israel is paving key Gaza road,BBC Verify looks at roadwork that analysts say shows Israel is unlikely to fully withdraw from Gaza any time soon.,7 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:36.147676,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli forces have been laying tarmac on a key road in Gaza along its southern border - in what some commentators see as a signal that they're not prepared to fully withdraw from the territory any time soon. The road has become a major sticking point in the negotiations for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery, photos and video that show the surfacing of a road along the narrow but strategically important strip of land running the length of Gaza's border with Egypt, long known by its Israeli military codename: the Philadelphi Corridor. Between 26 August and 5 September, satellite imagery captured at regular intervals shows fresh paving along a section of road extending 6.4km inland from the coast along the border fence. A video posted online on 4 September which shows construction work, reportedly that evening, along a stretch of the border fence.  Heavy machinery can be seen laying fresh tarmac wide enough for two large vehicles to pass. We’ve also compared two images below which show the laying of tarmac before and after. BBC Verify has confirmed the location and that they show the same stretch along the border fence. The corridor includes the Rafah crossing with Egypt - which has been Gaza’s only crossing not directly controlled by Israel and key for aid deliveries. At 12.6 km (7.8 miles) long, it runs adjacent to the Egyptian border from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Mediterranean Sea. While the Israeli military calls it the Philadelphi Route or Axis, Palestinians often refer to it as the Salah al-Din Axis. ""It's not a specific, demarcated area,” says Dr Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King’s College London. “It's a conceptual line. It's understood as land adjacent to the border.” Israel previously pulled out of the area in 2005, when it withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza. But it re-entered the Philadelphi Corridor on 7 May this year with tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) - months before starting to pave the road. Troops seized control of the Rafah crossing and then began advancing north-west both along the corridor and into the nearby southern city of Rafah. In the past four months, the IDF has destroyed hundreds of buildings near the corridor with air and artillery strikes, as well as through controlled demolitions with explosives and bulldozers. One village - Al Qarya as Suwaydiya - at the Mediterranean end of the border - has been flattened and now appears to be operating as an Israeli base. “Paving the road puts pressure on negotiators and mediators. The Israelis are trying to create a fait accompli,” says Dr Krieg. “It also suggests that Israel is not going to withdraw entirely from the Gaza strip any time soon,” he says. He cites a road built earlier this year by Israeli forces across northern Gaza - known as the Netzarim Corridor. ""If you look at the investments made in the Netzarim Corridor, it's clear they have no intention of withdrawing anytime soon, they've got concrete barriers, forward operating bases with towers and walls - you don't build those if you're planning on withdrawing.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the Philadelphi Corridor as a ""lifeline"" for Hamas, and is adamant that Israel maintains a military presence there as a condition of any agreement. At a press conference on Wednesday, he added: ""You want to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities, you can't let Hamas rearm. So you have to control the corridor."" The IDF’s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said on 14 August that “the Philadelphi Corridor is important because it deals with strengthening our position. We are preparing for all scenarios that the political level may decide.” Retired Egyptian Major General Dr Samir Faraj, now a commentator on military strategy, said Israel’s aim was “psychological warfare… paving the road is a media war, a war in which Israel sends a message to different parties that they will not leave.“ We have asked the Israeli military why it is surfacing the road now but have not received a response. Mr Netanyahu says Hamas has used tunnels underneath the corridor to smuggle weapons and people via Egypt before the 7 October attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. He believes Israeli forces deployed there will prevent the group rearming and ensure it never again poses a threat. In a visit to the corridor last month, Mr Gallant was quoted as saying: “We have destroyed 150 tunnels on the Philadelphi Corridor, stretching across the Gaza-Egypt border.” BBC Verify has located detonations in videos, shared by the IDF, to the Philadelphi Corridor - including one which it says shows “destruction of underground infrastructure” - but we are unable to confirm what is being destroyed. We have also seen photos and video - again, shared by the IDF - of one substantial tunnel in the corridor. All of these locations, as well as others along the border, show signs of major disturbances of the surface soil on satellite imagery.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zpy3zj7ro,Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election,People in Beijing tell the BBC's Laura Bicker their hopes and fears about who will win the White House race.,12 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:29:36.395021,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"In China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House. “None of us wants to see a war,” says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner. He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors.  They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China. In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds. It comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high. “I am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,” says Mr Xiang who’s in his sixties. Peace is what we want, he adds. A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble. They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election. “Although he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine’s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,” he said. Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. “Donald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,” says one.  “About Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.” Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media. China has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its “Arab brothers” in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel. On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a “constructive role” as he accused Washington of “exploiting the situation for selfish gain”. While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country’s leaders. But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan. “I don’t like Trump. I don’t think there is a good future between the US and China – there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,” says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out. He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict. “I don’t want it. I don’t want my son to go to the military,” he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi has said “reunification is inevitable”, vowing to retake it by force if necessary. The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a “commitment to security and prosperity for all nations.” Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection. “Taiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They’re immensely wealthy,” he said in a recent interview. “Taiwan should pay us for defence.” One of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn. Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump.  President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electronic vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.  “I don’t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,” says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people. Many of the the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power too. In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship. “Our country is a very prosperous and powerful country,” they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America. Taylor Swift is on their playlists too. Others like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day. As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation. Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. “Harris’s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it’s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.” The People’s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that makes up the most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800. Xi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously. He said that on dozens of occasions the security forces or a government ministry have prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US. On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials. Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China. “We may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,” she says as she heads off to join her family.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdl751l3djo,Israeli forces pull out of Jenin after major operation,"More than 20 Palestinians, including civilians, were killed in over a week of battles with militants.",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:36.494315,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli forces have withdrawn from Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank after a major nine-day operation there. The area - a stronghold of militants and with a civilian population of about 60,000 - was targeted in one of the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) biggest actions in the West Bank for years. The IDF said it was acting against terrorism. At least 36 Palestinians were killed - 21 from Jenin governorate - the Palestinian health ministry says. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says children are also among those killed. An Israeli soldier was also killed during fighting in Jenin. The city of Tubas and al-Faraa refugee camp were also raided during the operation across the northern West Bank - the deadliest of its kind since the start of the war in Gaza last October triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel. Hundreds of troops from several branches of the security forces were involved, with civilians confined to their homes and utilities cut as the Israeli military battled with militants on the ground and with air strikes. Also on Friday in the West Bank, a 26-year-old American woman, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was shot dead in the occupied West Bank during a protest in the town of Beita near Nablus. Following the Israeli withdrawal from Jenin refugee camp, residents are emerging into the streets for the first time since the IDF began its assault on 27 August.  Many, stunned and exhausted, slowly assessed the damage - the new layers of destruction mapping this operation onto the camp. Khalid abu Sabeer lives in a basement apartment next to the mosque. The entire floor of his home, he said, was blown out by a powerful explosion.  The Israeli army was interested in a cave beneath the building, he said, that had been there for decades, empty.  The IDF asked him to leave before blowing it up – and his home along with it. Another resident of the camp, Mustafa Antir, described intense attacks from Israel. “It was impossible to tell where it was coming from: explosions, drones, shooting.  Here and here and here, and from the sky. You can’t imagine how heavy it was.” Years of violent confrontation between the Israeli army and Palestinian armed groups have been etched into Jenin's narrow pathways – bullet-holes scattered across walls, piles of rubble left by military bulldozers, graffiti in the shape of M16 rifles, along with the name ""Hamas"". Among the destruction is a hole in the middle of the city centre – the main road broken and impassable.  Construction vehicles dig whole tree trunks out of the shattered road and cart them away. Shop owners and photojournalists clamber over the rubble to inspect the damage.  On either side, a crowd has paused to watch the rebuilding: residents on foot, on scooters, on bicycles, out on the streets for the first time in more than nine days. The head of Jenin’s government hospital, Dr Wissam Bakr, who is also there, says the first four days of the Israeli operation were the hardest for the hospital, with power and water supplies cut.  They were relying on generators and water tanks, he said, with two new-borns and two elderly patients on ventilators. Further down the same road, the sounds of the city have returned: stallholders are back at the edge of the marketplace, hawking carts full of fresh fruit and vegetables; the cafes around packed with generations of men and boys. On Friday morning, gunfire erupted again in the refugee camp, signalling the start of many funerals taking place. The BBC understands at least eight of the dead are civilians, including a 16-year-old girl. At the funeral of Mohammed Zubeidi, one of five militants killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in Tubas on Thursday, a Palestinian fighter spoke defiantly.  ""When you see the Israelis kill your brother, kill this or that person, how do you – in your heart – stay sitting and looking at all of this?"" he said to the BBC. ""People are afraid that they’re coming to destroy their homes, or arrest them, but so what? Let them arrest everyone – my brother has been arrested for two years. So what?” The IDF said Zubeidi was “a significant terrorist from the Jenin area”. He was also the son of Zakaria Zubeidi, the imprisoned former commander in Jenin of the Fatah movement’s armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. In a statement, the Israeli military said that in the Jenin area ""14 terrorists [had] been eliminated, over 30 suspects [had] been apprehended, [and] approximately 30 explosives planted under roads were dismantled"" during the operation. It said it had also dismantled what it called ""numerous terror infrastructure sites...  including an underground weapons storage facility located beneath a mosque, and a lab used to manufacture explosives"" and had removed ""large quantities of weapons"". The Palestinian health ministry says three Palestinians have also been killed in the southern governorate of Hebron over the past nine days. The Israeli military said one of them carried out a shooting attack that killed three Israeli police officers near Tarqumiyah on Sunday. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s attack and the ensuing war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, the Palestinian health ministry says. Israel says it is trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9pnn0npnyo,Rachel Reeves says tough choices will be worth it,The chancellor defends winter fuel cuts and promises better days lie ahead in big conference speech.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:36.606710,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Rachel Reeves has promised Britain’s “best days lie ahead” as she sought to strike a more optimistic tone in her first speech to the Labour Party conference as chancellor. Reeves has been accused of talking the economy down by warning of “tough choices” to deal with what she says is a worse-than-expected inheritance from the Conservatives. In her speech, she said: ""My ambition for Britain knows no limits because I can see the prize on offer if we make the right choices now.” But she faces a backlash from the trade unions and many Labour members over her decision to strip winter fuel payments from 10 million pensioners, with a conference debate expected later this week. As Reeves stood up to deliver her 25 minute speech, news broke that nurses in England have said the government's award of a 5.5% pay rise is not enough, in an online poll. Then, a few minutes into the speech, the chancellor was interrupted by a heckler protesting about continued arms sales to Israel while the war with Hamas in Gaza continues. A campaign group called The Climate Resistance has claimed responsibility for the protest. As the protester was dragged out of the hall, the chancellor won a standing ovation for saying that ""this is a changed Labour Party and not a party of protest"". She also received a rapturous response when she promised a ""war on Tory waste"", with the appointment of a Covid corruption commissioner to help recoup £674m of disputed contracts the Conservatives had agreed to waive. To loud applause, she said: ""That money belongs in our police, it belongs in our health service and belongs in our schools. Conference, we want that money back."" She announced that Labour's promise to set up free breakfast clubs would be piloted in 750 primary schools in England from April, at a cost of £7m. This will be followed by a national rollout, she told the conference, describing it as ""an investment in our young people, an investment in reducing child poverty and investment in our economy"". Defending her decision to cut winter fuel payments for many pensioners, she said: ""It was made clear to me that failure to act swiftly could undermine the UK's fiscal position with implications for public debt, mortgages and prices. ""And so, I took action to make the in-year savings necessary."" Looking ahead to her first Budget on 30 October, Reeves said there would be no increases in income tax, national insurance or VAT - and ""no return to austerity"". She said it would be a Budget for economic growth and investment - but gave few clues about tax and spending decision it might contain.  Instead, she spoke of the ""prize"" on offer from economic stability and a new industrial strategy to spread wealth across Britain. ""Yes, we must deal with the Tory legacy and that means tough decisions, but I won't let that dim our ambition for Britain,"" she told delegates. ""So, it will be a budget with real ambition, a budget to fix the foundations, a budget to deliver the change that we promised, a Budget to rebuild Britain."" The BBC's Faisal Islam points out that consumer confidence was hit, and some retailers spooked by disappointing sales after talk of pain. The chancellor was sending a message that the tax rises, when they come, will not primarily hit hard-pressed working families, he says. And he says the UK is heading towards some changes to the rules on government borrowing in order to allow more investment. Reeves also used her speech to announce new measures to target tax dodgers and help close the £39.8bn shortfall between the amount of tax owed and that which has actually been collected.  The plans include recruiting 5,000 more tax officials over the next five years, with 200 new compliance officers set to start at HMRC in November. Labour's leadership team has also come under fire from one of their own MPs over accepting donations of clothes despite their six-figure salaries. Speaking ahead of her speech, Reeves said she could ""understand why people find it a little bit odd that politicians get support for things like buying clothes"". She said that while shadow chancellor a friend had given her clothes to wear on the campaign trail and for big speeches.  She added that the donations had been declared but that she would not continue to accept such donations while a government minister."

Writing in the Sunday Times Sir Keir Starmer says one year ago we were unaware that the Middle East was about to be ""plunged into a new and terrible darkness"".  The prime minister also calls out what he describes as the ""vile hatred"" which has been seen against Jews and Muslims since then. The Observer and the Sunday Express both focus on messages from the major faith leaders in Britain ahead of the anniversary. The papers say they've united to reject prejudice - in what has been described as a high level act of solidarity. The Mail on Sunday features accounts from some of the people whose children were kidnapped by Hamas a year ago. One woman tells the paper she ""cannot sleep"" and ""every night I'm thinking of them"". The Sunday Telegraph has spoken to the historian Simon Schama. It says he has ""long chronicled the suffering of the Jewish people"" but that nothing had prepared him for the attack by Hamas, describing it as a ""punch to the soul"". In other news, the Observer says Labour's plans to impose 20% VAT on private school fees may not proceed as planned in January due to ""warnings from unions, tax experts and school leaders"". Numerous organisations within the education sector are said to be calling for a delay until September to give private schools more time to adapt. But in a statement the Treasury says there has been no change to the date. The Times claims that Russian intelligence used a ""honeytrap"" to recruit an Irish politician as an agent for the Kremlin during the Brexit talks. It says one of the aims was to undermine relations between Britain, Ireland and the EU. The Irish military and security services have reportedly identified the agent but, in the words of the paper, the individual is ""still at large"" in the country's parliament. The Sunday Mirror leads on government plans to invest in a blood test which could detect the twelve most common types of cancer before symptoms start to develop. The paper says it could be a ""game changer"". According to the Sunday Times the disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson - who is currently serving a twenty year sentence for harming his patients - is to be stripped of his one million pound pension pot by the Health Secretary. The paper says Wes Streeting is using rules which allow NHS benefits to be forfeited ""in the case of criminal, negligent or fraudulent acts"". And the Observer celebrates the actor Alasdair Buchan who's joining the West End cast of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap - despite a legal run-in with the show in his youth. In 1997, at the age of 11, he directed his own version of the play at school, only for his teachers to receive a cease and desist letter from lawyers representing the London production.  He says the school managed to ""smooth things over"" and he points to his recent casting as proof he wasn't blacklisted by the producers. The paper sums up the story with the headline ""Hedunnit"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zymygrgdo,"We must show nerve in support for Ukraine, says Lammy",It comes as Ukraine continues to call for permission to fire Western long-range missiles into Russia.,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:36.869122,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The foreign secretary has said allies must show ""nerve"" in their support for Ukraine, as the country continues to call for permission to fire Western long-range missiles into Russia.  David Lammy said there was a ""real-time discussion"" between allies about how to help Ukraine heading into the winter. Speaking alongside him at a fringe event at Labour's party conference, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Valerii Zaluzhnyi said lifting restrictions on the use of weapons against military targets in Russia was ""critical"". Ukraine already has supplies of long-range missiles from the UK, the United States and France but at the moment it is only allowed to fire them at targets within its own borders. Mr Lammy told the event: ""This is a critical time for nerve and for guts and for patience and for fortitude on behalf of allies who stand with Ukraine."" He added: ""I am not going to, as foreign secretary, of course, comment on operational detail, because that can only aid Putin. ""But there is a very real-time discussion across allies about how we can support Ukraine as we head into the winter."" Earlier, Mr Zaluzhnyi had described weapons with long-range capabilities as ""critically important"".  ""Lifting restrictions on use of weapons against military targets in Russia is critical. This would help protect civilians from Russian missiles,"" he said. ""This winter in Ukraine will be the most difficult. As we know, I believe in the resilience of the Ukrainian people, but without additional help the price will be very, very high."" Earlier this month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden met  in Washington to discuss the issue.  There had been strong indications the US and the UK were poised to lift the restrictions on long-range missiles but no confirmation came after the talks. Discussions are expected to continue at the UN General Assembly in New York next week, which Sir Keir and Biden are attending alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under regular bombardment. Many of these missiles are launched by aircraft deep inside Russia and Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself. Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded for the restrictions on the use of long-range missiles to be lifted.  However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned against this, arguing it would represent ""direct participation"" by Western allies in the war.  Ukraine’s allies have been reluctant to do anything which could drag them into direct conflict with Moscow. In his speech to the main conference hall later, Lammy insisted the government would always stand with Ukraine and had committed £3bn per year in military aid ""for as long as it takes"".  ""We need to show Putin that Britain - and its allies - are not going anywhere,"" he said. He also spoke about the ""worrying escalation"" in fighting between Israel and Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollah in recent days, which he said was in ""nobody's interest"".  ""Our message to all parties is clear: we need an immediate ceasefire from both sides so that we can get to a political settlement,"" he said. ""So that Israelis and Lebanese civilians can return to their homes and live in peace and security."" He repeated his call for British nationals still in Lebanon to leave immediately ""for your own safety""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33ve3rvej4o,Union criticises 'censorship' after play cancelled,"A play was cancelled, reportedly in a dispute over references to the Israel-Gaza war and trans rights.",19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:36.944994,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Arts union Equity has criticised a ""growing culture of censorship"" after a play was cancelled, reportedly in a dispute over references to the Israel-Gaza war and trans rights. The Royal Exchange, Manchester's main producing theatre, has scrapped its entire five-week run of a modern retelling of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Equity said it was ""deeply frustrated"" at the lack of transparency over the cancellation, and that it was speaking to theatre bosses to ""protect the principle of artistic freedom"". The theatre has said it wants ""to work with artists who address complex issues"" but the play faced ""a number of challenges"". It said those challenges included ""injuries, a delayed technical week and changes late in the process"". The Manchester Evening News reported that the show, set in the city's present-day rave scene, was axed after managers objected to a song with lyrics that referred to trans rights and the phrase ""free Palestine"". Theatre news outlet The Stage reported that one of the points of contention was ""free Palestine"" being daubed on the set as well as featuring in a rap. Equity said union officials met the theatre's management on Wednesday and ""received assurances that they take our concerns seriously"". A statement said: ""While we welcome the engagement, we remain deeply frustrated by the lack of transparency regarding the events leading to the cancellation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ""For Equity, this is an issue of dignity at work and freedom of expression. We absolutely back the rights of our members – performers, stage management, creative team and all involved in the production – to be treated with dignity and respect at work. ""We reject the growing culture of censorship created by funders and pressure groups. We are fighting for artistic integrity, as well as dignity for our members, and all working people. ""We remain in conversation with Royal Exchange management to protect the principle of artistic freedom, guarantee our members’ dignity at work, and ensure the integrity of our collective agreements."" A theatre spokesperson said: ""At the Royal Exchange Theatre we want to work with artists who address complex issues. ""Sadly, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream a number of challenges occurred which led to a decision to cancel the production - including injuries, a delayed technical week and changes late in the process. ""Despite our best efforts we were unable to get the show on as planned and took the difficult decision to cancel the production. Every effort was made to get the production on stage."" The show's director Stef O'Driscoll and cast have not commented on the reasons for the cancellation. The decision has damaged the theatre's credibility among some observers. Actor Giovanni Bienne, a member of Equity's LGBT+ committee, wrote on X: ""Every director worth their salt who wants to address 'complex issues' will laugh and spit in the @rxtheatre's face whenever they try to hire them. ""Working there will make you an establishment stooge. And who wants that reputation."" Denise Fahmy, who co-founded the group Freedom in the Arts, wrote: ""The production sounds dreadful - perhaps that’s the reason ⁦@rxtheatre⁩ cancelled it - but once commissioned, shouldn’t audiences decide whether to see it or not?"" The venue receives £2.4m a year from Arts Council England, the body's third-highest annual theatre grant, behind the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company. A spokesperson for Arts Council England said all recipients of funding ""remain fully responsible for their operations, artistic programme, and the day-to-day management of their activities"". The Greater Manchester Combined Authority, one of the theatre's other main funders, said it was ""in conversation with the Royal Exchange to better understand the situation"" and that all cultural bodies it funds ""retain full responsibility for the artistic direction of their programmes and the operational management of their organisations"". Last year, the Royal Exchange scrapped its artistic director post and replaced it with a less senior creative director role."

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who had joint nationality, was taking part in a protest against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beita near Nablus.  According to local media reports, Ms Eygi was shot by Israeli troops.   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was ""looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area"". A fellow protester told the BBC Friday's demonstration was Ms Eygi's first time attending a protest with the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian group. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken deplored the ""tragic loss"", while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan branded the Israeli action ""barbaric"". Turkey's foreign ministry said Ms Eygi was ""killed by Israeli occupation soldiers in the city of Nablus"". The White House did not ascribe blame, but called on Israel to investigate. Earlier, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington was ""urgently gathering more information about the circumstances of her death"".  Ms Eygi was born in Antalya, as reported by Turkish media. The dual-national was rushed to a hospital in Nablus and later pronounced dead. Dr Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital where Ms Eygi was admitted, confirmed that a US citizen in her mid-20s had died from a ""gunshot in the head"". In a statement, the IDF said: ""Today (Friday), during Israeli security forces activity adjacent to the area of Beita, the forces responded with fire toward a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. ""The IDF is looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review."" Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli activist who was at the same protest as Ms Eygi, said he had heard ""two separate shots of live ammunition, shot one after the other... and then I heard another shot"". ""I found her lying on the ground, beside the tree, bleeding from her head,"" Mr Pollak told AFP news agency, as he showed blood on the hand he used to stop Ms Eygi's head from bleeding. ""I took her pulse, she had a very weak pulse, we called the ambulance. ""From there we evacuated her to the village's medical centre, where the doctor came into the ambulance and continued into the hospital, where they tried to resuscitate her but failed."" Mr Pollak said the killing was ""now receiving the light of day because she is an American citizen"". In an interview with the BBC's Newshour programme, Mr Pollak was asked about the IDF's statement, where the Israeli military said security forces had been responding to ""a main instigator who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them"". Mr Pollak said there had been clashes but he felt that soldiers had been ""under no threat"".  He also said that where Ms Eygi was shot had been a ""separate incident at a separate place"", adding that there had been ""no stone throwing"" where she had been.  Israeli forces withdrew from Jenin city and its refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Friday, following a major nine-day operation there. The Palestinian health ministry says at least 36 Palestinians were killed - 21 from Jenin governorate - in that time. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says children are also among those killed. In the past 50 years, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl2370ldxro,Netanyahu doubles down on control of Gaza's border with Egypt,Israel's prime minister insists his forces will not leave the Philadelphi corridor between Gaza and Egypt.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:43.553468,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has again insisted that Israeli forces will not leave the Philadelphi Corridor - a strategically important strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt. He told foreign media in Jerusalem that he is “open” to considering alternatives to the presence of Israeli troops along the Gaza-Egypt border, as part of any future permanent ceasefire deal – but that he did not see it happening. Mr Netanyahu argued that Israeli troops must remain in this buffer zone to prevent weapons and possibly Israeli hostages being smuggled across the border. Hamas said in a statement cited by Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahu's decision not to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor is an attempt to thwart the ceasefire agreement, adding that it was time to put pressure on Israel. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said conditions for any permanent ceasefire must include ""a situation where the Philadelphi corridor cannot be perforated."" He said if someone could show, “not on paper, not in words, not in a slide, but on the ground, day after day, week after week, month after month that they can actually prevent the recurrence of what happened there before we're open to consider it.” But, he continued, “I don’t see that happening […]  And until that happens, we are there.” His comments open a miniscule crack in his repeated insistence that Israeli forces would not leave Gaza’s southern border. But he also doubled-down on his insistence that Israel needed to keep troops there for its security, describing it as a “red line”. “People said: this will kill the deal,” he continued. “And I say: such a deal will kill us.” Making more concessions after Hamas killed six hostages last week would be “illogical”, “immoral” and “insane,” he insisted.   “We have red lines. They haven’t changed. We’ll hold to them.”  His security chiefs, including his defence minister, are widely reported to have backed alternatives to a military presence along the border, such as technological solutions to monitor activity there, or the presence of allied forces. Leaks to Israeli media have described shouting matches between the prime minister and his defence chiefs in meetings, with Mr Netanyahu reportedly accused of not wanting a deal at all. A growing number of people here appear to believe that the prime minister is playing for time, and that his real goal is to find and kill the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, before ending the war. Mr Netanyahu says he is safeguarding Israel’s security in the face of extraordinary international pressure.  And that it is Hamas who is blocking a deal. Talks on a permanent ceasefire would only take place once Israel and Hamas agree to begin the first phase of a three-step plan, which is being pushed heavily by US President Joe Biden. Israel’s national public radio quoted an unnamed senior official who said that the chief negotiator, Mossad head David Barnea, had conveyed to mediators Israel’s agreement to withdraw troops from the border at a later stage in the ceasefire process. But even getting agreement on the first stage is proving tricky, with many issues still unresolved."

Karim Khan said it was important to show the court would hold all nations to the same standard in relation to alleged war crimes. He also welcomed the new UK government's decision to drop its opposition to the arrest warrants. “There's a difference of tone and I think of substance in relation to international law by the new government. And I think that's welcome,” he told Political Thinking with Nick Robinson. He has also requested warrants for three Hamas leaders, two of whom have since been killed. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Khan explained the ICC needed to request warrants for leaders on both sides to ensure people around the world thought the court was applying “the law equally based upon some common standards”. “If one had applied for warrants in relation to Israeli officials and not for Gaza, [some would] say: ‘well, this is an obscenity’ and, ‘how on earth is that possible?’” he said. “You can't have one approach for countries where there's support, whether it's Nato support, European support [and] powerful countries behind you, and a different approach where you have clear jurisdiction,"" he added. In May, Mr Khan said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders Yahiya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October onwards. However the request for the warrants must yet be approved by ICC judges.  Mr Khan said Israel's prime minister and defence minister were suspected of crimes including starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, and extermination. He accused the Hamas leaders of having committed crimes including extermination, murder, hostage taking, rape and sexual violence, and torture. Israel and Hamas have both rejected the allegations. US President Joe Biden said the application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders was ""outrageous"". But Mr Khan told the BBC that unlike his critics, he had seen the evidence the warrant requests were based on.  “I have one advantage at least. Hopefully even they will concede I've seen the evidence. They haven't,"" he said. “The application is not public. It is confidential. It is filed to the chamber. So they are guessing what evidence has been submitted."" The previous UK Conservative government had indicated it planned to make a submission to the court, having questioned the right of the prosecutor to apply for a warrant against the Israeli leaders.  But in July, a spokesperson for the Labour administration which succeeded it said the issue was a ""matter for the court"" and therefore would not be making a submission.  Mr Khan told the BBC he had been pressured by some world leaders not to issue warrants. “Several leaders and others told me and advised me and cautioned me,” he said. Turning to the war in Ukraine, Mr Khan said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""see the inside of a courtroom"", pointing to historic cases of other world leaders being brought before the court.  “Nothing is permanent. Life is transitory. And every political life ends in failure,"" he said. Mr Putin was not arrested during his visit on Tuesday to Mongolia, an ICC signatory, despite the valid arrest warrant for alleged war crimes committed during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The Russian leader is wanted for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children since the start of the war in 2022. Moscow has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were ""outrageous"". ------ Karim Khan's interview with Nick Robinson will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 17:30 BST on Saturday and is already available on BBC Sounds and the Political Thinking website."

The US state department says Mr Blinken will open a so-called “US-UK strategic dialogue” - understood to be a series of meetings between senior officials which Washington describes as “reaffirming” the “special relationship” between the two countries.  Mr Blinken will “discuss a range of critical issues, including the Indo-Pacific, AUKUS partnership, the Middle East, and our collective efforts to support Ukraine,” the state department said.  It is understood Mr Blinken is also likely to meet Prime Minister Keir Starmer while he is in the UK.  The foreign secretary and Mr Blinken met on the Keir Starmer's first visit to Washington as prime minister back in July for the Nato summit.  Following that meeting, the state department said that Mr Blinken and Mr Lammy ""re-affirmed the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the economic, security, and humanitarian assistance it needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity"". The pair also ""discussed the need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of hostages and lays the groundwork for durable peace"". Mr Blinken has been a frequent visitor to Israel, having been 10 times since the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year.  Following his most recent meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Blinken said the Israeli prime minister had accepted Washington's so-called ""bridging proposal"" aimed at trying to solve sticking points and bring Israel and Hamas closer to a deal. Pressure has been growing on Mr Netanyahu to close out a deal, amid widespread protests in Israel last week. On Friday, the White House announced that the UK prime minister will also travel to Washington for his second bilateral meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday 13 September.  The PM said his first face-to face talks with President Biden in July were an opportunity to ""recommit"" to Nato and the ""special relationship"" between the UK and US. Speaking ahead of next week's meeting, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Mr Starmer and Mr Biden will have ""an in-depth discussion on a range of global issues of mutual interest"". The White House added ""robust support to Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression"" will also be discussed, as well as securing a hostage release and ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza.  ""President Biden will underscore the importance of continuing to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,"" the White House also said. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l1qd1nwnjo,"Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues, from tax to Israel","From abortion to trade, here are his policy pledges as he runs for the White House for a third time.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:43.819330,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president for the third consecutive election.  When he was defeated by Joe Biden after his first term in office, the country was in the midst of Covid, lockdowns and social unrest.  It followed a campaign in which restoring both economic health and law and order were his central messages. Here are his policy pledges this time. This is the biggest issue for voters and it’s the pinch of high food and housing costs that seems to be shaping their sentiment rather than the robust growth and low unemployment. Inflation has fallen steeply from a 40-year high in 2022, but the former New York businessman has retained a persistent polling advantage on the economy over his Democratic opponents. One of the 20 core promises on his campaign website is to “end inflation and make America affordable again”. A president’s power to lower prices directly is very limited. Trump has pledged to expand US energy production, opening areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs, though analysts are sceptical. He says he can reduce housing costs by preventing some undocumented immigrants from getting mortgages and deporting others, and by launching a home building programme on federal land. Trump has a raft of tax cuts planned. Firstly, he wants to extend the cuts he enacted in 2017, which are due to expire next year. That was the biggest tax overhaul in decades, aimed at simplifying the tax code and promoting growth and investment. The largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse. The Republican also wants to shave a further percentage point off corporation tax - and has floated an even bigger cut to 15%. He has proposed making tipped income tax free, a proposal that his opponent Kamala Harris subsequently backed, too. Trump has also called on abolishing the tax on Social Security payments, a move that would be welcomed by retired Americans but would at the same time punch a big hole in the fund. The former president brought the era of US free trade to a juddering halt when he became president, but his tariffs on Chinese imports were largely retained and even expanded by Joe Biden. This time around he has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods with imports from China bearing the brunt at 60%. It is part of his attempt to promote homegrown manufacturers and stop outsourcing, but some economists have warned this could push up prices for consumers. During the presidential debate with Harris, Trump pointed out he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and that the Biden administration has not removed them. This tops his list of priorities as it did in 2016 when “Build the wall” was his signature slogan. The number of border crossings hit record levels at the end of 2023, but has fallen this election year. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the wall and increasing enforcement. He has also promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history. His vice-president pick, JD Vance, said they would start by removing a million people, but experts told the BBC that deportations on that scale would face huge legal and logistical challenges. There are also claims it could slow economic growth. Children of undocumented residents would no longer be eligible for citizenship under another Trump policy, although this would face significant legal obstacles. This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, and Trump has struggled to find a consistent message. The three judges he appointed while president were pivotal in the landmark decision, which Democrats have used to rally supporters as abortion restrictions have been introduced in numerous states. Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion. But in recent weeks he has tried to walk a tightrope, taking a more moderate stance while trying not to alienate his conservative base. He criticised Florida’s six-week ban, provoking an angry backlash, but also said he would oppose a ballot measure in the state establishing the right to an abortion. During the presidential debate he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. The Republican has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. ""I know Zelensky very well, and I know Putin very well,"" he said during the presidential debate. ""I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal."" Trump gave no details on what he thinks each side should give up in such a deal, and the Kremlin has said nothing can be done in 24 hours. Trump has also said he would stop the cash flowing to Ukraine. Mr Biden signed off $61bn in military aid for Ukraine in April. On Nato, he thinks countries that fall short of the advisory 2% of GDP spent on defence should forego the protection that comes with membership. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel and condemned pro-Palestinian supporters on US college campuses. But he has also at times been critical of the way Israel has conducted the war. He has said the war would not have happened if he had been president but offered no details on how he would end it. As president he angered Palestinians by moving the embassy to Jerusalem and his administration stopped calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which contravene international law, illegal. In his top 20 priorities, Trump promises not to cut Medicare, which is federally provided health insurance for older people. While president he tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the signature legislation of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people. He still criticises the law, which remains popular, but in March he said on Truth Social he would not undermine it. Recently he called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but it's unclear if such a large expense has the support of Republicans in Congress. He has pledged to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. His Republican policy platform vows to restore safety in neighbourhoods by replenishing police departments and protecting officers from “frivolous lawsuits”. Democrats point to his promise to pardon hundreds of convicted January 6 rioters as contradictory to his law-and-order stance. They also point to the fact violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and murders down by 13%, according to FBI data. As president, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, and protections for federal waterways. This time, he is again vowing to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry. He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars. And he has long railed against offshore wind farms, promising to halt this source of renewable energy as soon as he is elected.

It says Iran has joined Hezbollah in threatening retaliation against Israel - which they blame for the waves of explosions that rocked Lebanon. The Guardian says the Lebanese foreign minister has called the bombings a dangerous development that could ""signal a wider war"". Analysis by the Financial Times says the attacks suggest Israel's strategy is to force Hezbollah to rethink its military support for Gaza. Several papers focus on the rape and sexual assault allegations against the former owner of Harrods, Mohamed Al Fayed. The Daily Mirror says there are fears there could be ""at least 100 victims"". The Daily Telegraph says the accusations raise questions about why Mr Al Fayad was not charged when Sir Keir Starmer was the director of public prosecutions. Downing Street has said Sir Keir had no involvement in the decision not to bring charges against the businessman, who had been questioned by police in 2008. The Daily Mail headlines an article by the Conservative leadership contender, Robert Jenrick, and his warning that ""English identity is under threat"". In the paper he writes that ""unprecedented migration"" and the ""dismantling of our national culture"" have presented what he calls ""huge problems"". The Times says the Treasury could be handed a budget boost of 10 billion pounds due to a slowdown in the rate that the Bank of England sells off bonds. The paper says some Labour MPs want the extra money to be used to delay the scrapping of winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners.  But the Treasury says the ""overall gains and losses"" from the changes made by the Bank of England are ""highly uncertain"". The Daily Express uses its front page to highlight the plight of pensioners due to lose winter fuel support.  An RAF veteran is pictured alongside the headline: ""I survived atomic bomb tests and cancer but will I survive this winter?"". The government has insisted the change is necessary to help address a £22 bn ""black hole"" in the public finances. Several papers are highly critical of government's defence of the prime minister for accepting more than a hundred thousand pounds in ""freebies"" since 2019. The Daily Star seizes on comments by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75n2wnkp1vo,UK halts all Iran flights as allies step up sanctions,The sanctions come as Western officials say Iran has supplied missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:44.025552,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The US, UK, France and Germany have imposed fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. The measures include restrictions on national carrier Iran Air's ability to fly to the UK and Europe, and travel bans and asset freezes on a number of Iranians accused of facilitating military support for Russia. Visiting London, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russians had been trained by Iranian forces to use short-range ballistic missiles and that they could be deployed against Ukrainians within weeks. Iran has repeatedly denied supplying such self-guided weapons to Russia. At a joint news conference with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Tuesday, Blinken asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""increasingly relying on support"" from Iran and North Korea to help ""wage his war of aggression on Ukraine"" in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. He said the US had recently shared intelligence with its partners showing that dozens of military personnel had been trained in Iran to use the Fath-360 ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 75 miles (120km). Lammy said the move was  ""a significant and dangerous escalation”.  The missiles are likely to boost Russia's arsenal, enabling it to hit Ukrainian cities close to Russia's borders or areas it already controls at the same time as it deploys its longer-range missiles deeper into Ukrainian territory.  The UK Foreign Office said the US and UK sanctions targeted several key individuals heavily involved in the ballistic missile and drone supply chains. They included Brig Gen Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari, who it said was director general for international relations at Iran’s defence ministry and was linked to its exports of defence products to its partners. Sanctions have also been imposed on five Russian cargo ships for transporting the military supplies from Iran, despite what the UK said were repeated warnings not to do so. Additionally, several organisations, including some allegedly involved in the production of Iran's kamikaze-style Shahed drones - which Russia has used consistently in attacks on Ukrainian cities - have been sanctioned. In a statement, the UK, France and Germany - known as the E3 - said Iran's supply of missiles represented a ""a direct threat to European security"". But Iran called the Western statements ""false and misleading"". The Western sanctions come as Russia has continued to make gains in eastern Ukraine, with Moscow's forces rapidly approaching the key settlement of Pokrovsk - an essential transport hub.  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made clear the UK government will continue to back Ukraine for as long as needed. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticised the pace of weapons deliveries, and asked for authorisation to strike targets deep inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles - a move the US has thus far resisted.  Blinken and Lammy also announced a joint trip to Ukraine this week, the first such trip in years as UK diplomats seek to frame the secretary of state's visit as a reaffirmation of a close partnership between the two countries, often described as the ""special relationship"". Blinken said one of their goals ahead of the visit was to ""hear directly from the Ukrainian leadership"" about their ""objectives and what we can do to support those needs""."

Two others were injured when a car was hit in Tubas early on Thursday. Israel's military said it had struck an “armed terrorist cell”, and armed groups claimed the dead as fighters. Palestinian media also said a 16-year-old boy had been shot dead by Israeli forces in nearby al-Faraa refugee camp.  The military said forces had killed “a terrorist who was armed with an explosive device” in an exchange of fire, and that a strike targeted others. For nine days, Israeli forces have been raiding northern cities as part of what they say is a major counter-terrorism operation. So far, at least 36 Palestinians have been killed, including 21 from Jenin governorate, eight from Tubas, according to the health ministry. Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups as members, but the ministry says several children are also among them, including a 16-year-old girl who was shot in her home near Jenin on Tuesday. One Israeli soldier has been killed during the fighting in Jenin. A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said soldiers and Israel Prison Service forces began an operation in Tubas and al-Faraa camp on Wednesday night. It named one of the five men killed in the air strike in Tubas as Mohammed Zakaria Zubeidi, 21, and said he was “a significant terrorist from the Jenin area”. He was also the son of Zakaria Zubeidi, the imprisoned former commander in Jenin of the Fatah movement’s armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and alleged mastermind of a jailbreak in 2021. The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades confirmed in a statement that Mohammed Zubeidi and four other fighters were killed in what it called a “treacherous” Israeli strike. Palestinian news agency Wafa also cited Palestinian Red Crescent sources as saying on Thursday that its crews had transferred the body of 16-year-old boy, Majed Fida Abu Zeina, from al-Faraa camp to a hospital in Tubas. The sources said he was shot more than once by Israeli forces and that his body was dragged out of the camp by a military bulldozer. The IDF said one of its aircraft had “struck armed terrorists who hurled explosives and shot at the security forces” during the operation in al-Faraa camp. “In an exchange of fire, Israel Prison Service forces eliminated a terrorist who was armed with an explosive device,” it added. The IDF provided no further details about the incidents, but it did release night-time aerial surveillance footage that appeared to show an unidentified person throwing an object that explodes before a missile targets them. The Palestinian health ministry says three Palestinians have also been killed in the southern governorate of Hebron over the past nine days. The Israeli military said one of them carried out a shooting attack that killed three Israeli police officers near Tarqumiyah on Sunday. On Tuesday, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF must use its “full strength” to combat what he called “the resurgence of terrorism” in the West Bank. There has been a spike in violence in the territory since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2np2l5mlko,UK defends partial Israel arm sales ban,"Defence Secretary John Healey responds to criticism by saying the UK remains a ""staunch ally"" of Israel.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.144522,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UK has defended its decision to suspend some arms sales to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the decision ""shameful"", saying on social media that it ""will only embolden Hamas"". But Husam Zomlot, the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, called the partial ban an “important first step” to the UK’s fulfilment of its “legal obligations under domestic and international law”. On Monday, the UK suspended around 30 out of 350 weapons export licences to Israel.  But Defence Secretary John Healey insisted the UK remained a ""staunch ally"" of Israel, telling the BBC Israel's security would not be weakened by the decision. Government ministers say the weapons could be used in Gaza to violate international law.  Human rights group Amnesty International UK said the measures were ""too limited"".  Others have criticised the timing of the announcement for coming on the same day funerals took place for six hostages killed by Hamas last week. Mr Healey told BBC Breakfast it was ""agonising"" seeing the faces of the dead hostages, but said the timing was ""driven by the fact that this was a legal process"" and the need to report to Parliament. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday the UK would be suspending 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Mr Healey said these were chosen because they supplement equipment used in Gaza for “offensive purposes”, while the “vast majority of other parts our country exports to Israel are either not related to the conflict or maybe used for Israel’s defence"". UK arms sales to Israel are small in comparison to other allies, contributing just 1% of the country’s defence imports. The UK exports arms to multiple countries including Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The US is by far the largest supplier of arms to Israel, accounting for 69% of its imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In a statement, Mr Zomlot said that the Palestinian Mission to the UK would ""continue working"" with the UK government towards a ""full arms embargo"". Amnesty International UK accused the government of ""gesture politics"", given less than 10% of arms export licences were suspended.  The charity's chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh, said the restrictions were ""too limited and riddled with loopholes"". “[The] decision means that while ministers apparently accept that Israel may be committing war crimes in Gaza, [the government] is nevertheless continuing to risk complicity in war crimes, apartheid - and possible genocide - by Israeli forces in Gaza,"" he said. The non-profit organisation has continuously called for a ceasefire and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. On social media, Mr Netanyahu said: ""With or without British arms, Israel will win this war and secure our common future. ""Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain’s misguided decision will only embolden Hamas."" Asked about comments made by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who accused the government of ""abandoning Israel"", Mr Healey insisted the UK would support Israel in defending itself if it came under direct attack. Criticism has also come from within the Labour Party. Former shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the timing was “unfortunate”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World Tonight programme on Monday, she said: “I suspect that what was wanted was once they got the legal advice, they wanted to come in and tell Parliament about it straight away, but I think that it was unfortunate given all the funerals."" Ms Thornberry also said she expected a “detailed summary"" of the legal advice the government had received over arms, amid questions over the continued supply of parts for F35 jets. Mr Healey said components for F35s were “deliberately” not included in the suspension as they are used by 20 countries and it would be  ""hard to distinguish"" which components would go into Israeli jets. Zarah Sultana, who is currently sitting as an independent MP after being suspended from the Labour Party, has called for an end to all arms sales to Israel.  Writing on X, formerly Twitter, the MP for Coventry South described the F35 jets as “the most lethal in the world”. Former national arms advisor Lord Peter Ricketts told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the government’s decision was ""long overdue"". Lord Ricketts told the BBC in April following an Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers that the UK should stop selling arms to Israel, claiming there was “abundant evidence” that obligations on civilian safety were not being fulfilled. In his latest interview with the BBC, he said: “There comes a point when the legal advice is so clear the government has an obligation to follow it."" The Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the move was ""welcome but inadequate"", and said it would continue to push for the government to ""apply the principles of international law"" to all export licenses.  Israel has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October during which about 1,200 were killed and 251 were taken hostage.  More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

The Greek-owned and flagged MV Sounion, carrying about a million barrels of crude, was abandoned by its crew after being hit by missiles on 21 August. Houthi fighters later detonated explosives on board, sparking several fires. A photo released on Monday night showed three vessels belonging to what the EU mission described as “private stakeholders” carrying out the salvage operation, protected by a warship. The Sounion’s destination was not given, but Saudi Arabia has reportedly offered to help the salvagers offload its oil. “The completion of this phase of the salvage operation is the result of a comprehensive approach and close co-operation between all stakeholders committed to prevent an environmental disaster affecting the whole region,” the EU’s Operation Aspides said on X. A potential spill from the Sounion could be almost four times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which saw 2,100km (1,300 miles) of coastline contaminated after a tanker ran aground off Alaska, according to the US. The Iran-backed Houthis said at the end of August that they had agreed to allow the Sounion to be towed away from Yemen after being contacted by “several international parties”. They also stressed that the attack on the tanker showed their “seriousness in targeting any ship that violates the Yemeni embargo”. The Houthis have repeatedly targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November, sinking two vessels, seizing another and causing the deaths of at least four crew members. They say they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. They have not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels, nor by US and British air strikes on territory they control in north-western Yemen. Israel also bombed Yemen in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv, and it has vowed to make the Houthis pay a “heavy price” for a missile attack on Sunday. In a separate development on Monday, the Houthis said they had shot down a US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen’s Dhamar province and released videos which they said showed the charred wreckage on the ground. The US military said it was aware of the claim."

Aged between three and six, the children were found inside the unused deep freezer in the densely populated area of the town of Katima Mulilo on Monday afternoon. The police believe the children were accidentally trapped while playing and suffocated inside but investigations are under way. Of the four children, two suffocated to death in the fridge while two others died in the hospital while receiving treatment, the public broadcaster reported.   “When I came in, I saw paramedics attending to my daughter and another girl. They rushed them to the hospital, while the other two were loaded in police mortuary vehicles,” Aranges Shoro, one of the fathers, told privately owned The Namibian newspaper.  ""There was a hook on the freezer that could only be opened from the outside,"" Zambezi regional police commander Andreas Shilelo is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying. ""They were stuck for about an hour and a half and suffocated."" The two who were rushed to the nearby Katima Mulilo State Hospital were declared dead upon arrival, the public broadcaster NBC's news website reported.  It is not clear why the non-functional freezer was left outside a house of one of the affected families.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jlv28n2kvo,Government sets out more Israel-sceptic posture,A series of recent decisions suggest Labour wants to shift the UK's position on the conflict in Gaza.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.430771,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"It felt like quite a moment. The new-ish government spelling out a different approach to Israel and the conflict in the Middle East from that of its predecessor – the third such time it has done so in two months. When David Lammy became foreign secretary in early July, he requested an assessment of whether the evidence suggested Israel’s approach to the war could be in breach of international law. The assessment, I understand, was similar to those requested by the previous government and conducted by the same group of officials. But officials advise and ministers decide – and ministers now have come to a different conclusion than their predecessors. Here is how the process works. Laws passed when Labour was last in government set out the controls that must be in place when goods are exported for military use or potential military use. They are the Export Control Act 2002 and the Export Control Order 2008. As Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds set out: “Following a rigorous process in line with the UK’s legal obligations, the UK Government has concluded that there is a clear risk that military exports to Israel, where used for military operations in Gaza, might be used in serious violations of international humanitarian law.” You can read Mr Reynolds’ full written statement here. And here is the government’s summary of its own arguments.  It is worth keeping a sense of proportion on all this. Of roughly 350 arms exports to Israel, about 30 are being suspended – so less than 10%. And the UK is not a particularly significant arms exporter to Israel anyway. But messages and signals matter in politics – internationally and domestically. The Israeli government, which was told privately in advance before the public announcement, has expressed its disappointment. Shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell – himself the deputy foreign secretary in the last Conservative government until earlier this summer – wasn’t initially critical, but later was, saying the move had “all the appearance of something designed to satisfy Labour’s backbenches, while at the same time not offending Israel, an ally in the Middle East. I fear it will fail on both counts”. Senior government figures insist they are legally obliged to suspend these export licences given the conclusion they have come to. But they are trying to ameliorate their actions with their words, insisting too that the decision is a matter of “deep regret.” And they say this decision was taken on its own merits, as were the other two relating to the conflict that I mentioned a moment ago. They were the resumption of funding for UNRWA, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees. And the dropping of plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There is subtlety and nuance in each of these decisions, but they do collectively add up to a more Israel-sceptic posture than the last Conservative government adopted. For much of the last year, since the Hamas atrocities in Israel, Labour has felt political pressure from those who claim it has been too unthinkingly supportive of Israel. And in seats with a substantial Muslim population, the conflict and Labour’s approach to it often proved to be a big issue for voters at the general election, many of whom point to the death toll in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Yes, that sense of proportion and scale is worth bearing in mind. But so too the message and the signal being sent – about the different choices a new government is taking."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c207j6wy332o,Extremist settlers rapidly seizing West Bank land,"There has been a sharp rise in extremist Israeli settlers taking land from Palestinians, analysis shows.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.527646,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Last October, Palestinian grandmother Ayesha Shtayyeh says a man pointed a gun at her head and told her to leave the place she had called home for 50 years. She told the BBC the armed threat was the culmination of an increasingly violent campaign of harassment and intimidation that began in 2021, after an illegal settler outpost was established close to her home in the occupied West Bank. The number of these outposts has risen rapidly in recent years, new BBC analysis shows. There are currently at least 196 across the West Bank, and 29 were set up last year - more than in any previous year. The outposts - which can be farms, clusters of houses, or even groups of caravans - often lack defined boundaries and are illegal under both Israeli and international law. But the BBC World Service has seen documents showing that organisations with close ties to the Israeli government have provided money and land used to establish new illegal outposts. The BBC has also analysed open source intelligence to examine their proliferation, and has investigated the settler who Ayesha Shtayyeh says threatened her.  Experts say outposts are able to seize large swathes of land more rapidly than settlements, and are increasingly linked to violence and harassment towards Palestinian communities. Official figures for the number of outposts do not exist. But BBC Eye reviewed lists of them and their locations gathered by Israeli anti-settlement watchdogs Peace Now and Kerem Navot - as well as the Palestinian Authority, which runs part of the occupied West Bank. We analysed hundreds of satellite images to verify that outposts had been constructed at these locations and to confirm the year they were set up. The BBC also checked social media posts, Israeli government publications and news sources to corroborate this and to show that outposts were still in use. Our analysis suggests almost half (89) of the 196 outposts we verified have been built since 2019. Some of these are linked to growing violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank. Earlier this year, the British government sanctioned eight extremist settlers for inciting or perpetrating violence against Palestinians. At least six had established, or are living on, illegal outposts. Responding to our findings in this article, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement: “We strongly condemn the unprecedented levels of settler violence against the Palestinian community, as shown in the report, and have urged the Israeli authorities to end the culture of impunity and clamp down on those responsible.” A former commander of the Israeli army in the West Bank, Avi Mizrahi, says most settlers are law-abiding Israeli citizens, but he does admit the existence of outposts makes violence more likely. “Whenever you put outposts illegally in the area, it brings tensions with the Palestinians… living in the same area,” he says. One of the extremist settlers sanctioned by the UK was Moshe Sharvit - the man Ayesha says threatened her at gunpoint. Both he and the outpost he set up less than 800m (0.5miles) from Ayesha's home, were also sanctioned by the US government in March. His outpost was described as a “base from which he perpetrates violence against Palestinians”. “He’s made our life hell,” Ayesha says, who must now live with her son in a town close to Nablus. Outposts lack any official Israeli planning approval - unlike settlements, which are larger, typically urban, Jewish enclaves built throughout the West Bank, legal under Israeli law. Both are considered illegal under international law, which forbids moving a civilian population into an occupied territory. But many settlers living in the West Bank claim that, as Jews, they have a religious and historical connection to the land. In July, the UN’s top court, in a landmark opinion, said Israel should stop all new settlement activity and evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Israel rejected the opinion as “fundamentally wrong” and one-sided. Despite outposts having no legal status, there is little evidence that the Israeli government has been trying to prevent their rapid growth in numbers. The BBC has seen new evidence showing how two organisations with close ties to the Israeli state have provided money and land used to set up new outposts in the West Bank. One is the World Zionist Organization (WZO), an international body founded more than a century ago and instrumental in the establishment of the state of Israel. It has a Settlement Division - responsible for managing large areas of the land occupied by Israel since 1967. The division is funded entirely by Israeli public funds and describes itself as an “arm of the Israeli state”. Contracts obtained by Peace Now, and analysed by the BBC, show the Settlement Division has repeatedly allocated land on which outposts have been built. In the contracts, the WZO forbids the building of any structures and says the land should only be used for grazing or farming - but satellite imagery reveals that, in at least four cases, illegal outposts were built on it. One of these contracts was signed by Zvi Bar Yosef in 2018. He - like Moshe Sharvit - was sanctioned by the UK and US earlier this year for violence and intimidation against Palestinians. We contacted the WZO to ask if it was aware that multiple tracts of land it had allocated for grazing and farming were being used for the construction of illegal outposts. It did not respond. We also put questions to Zvi Bar Yosef, but received no reply. The BBC has also uncovered two documents revealing that another key settler organisation - Amana - loaned hundreds of thousands of shekels to help establish outposts. In one case, the organisation loaned NIS 1,000,000 ($270,000/£205,000) to a settler to build greenhouses on an outpost considered illegal under Israeli law. Amana was founded in 1978 and has worked closely with the Israeli government to build settlements throughout the West Bank ever since. But in recent years, there has been growing evidence that Amana also supports outposts. In a recording from a meeting of executives in 2021, leaked by an activist, Amana’s CEO Ze’ev Hever can be heard stating that: “In the last three years… one operation we have expanded is the herding farm [outposts].” “Today, the area [they control] is almost twice the size of built settlements.” This year, the Canadian government included Amana in a round of sanctions against individuals and organisations responsible for “violent and destabilising actions against Palestinian civilians and their property in the West Bank”. The sanctions did not mention outposts. The BBC contacted Amana to ask why it was providing loans used to establish outposts. It did not respond. There is also a trend of the Israeli government retroactively legalising outposts - effectively transforming them into settlements. Last year, for example, the government began the process of legalising at least 10 outposts, and granted at least six others full legal status. In February, Moshe Sharvit - the settler Ayesha Shtayyeh says evicted her from her home - hosted an open day at his outpost, filmed by a local camera crew. Speaking candidly, he laid out just how effective outposts can be for capturing land. “The biggest regret when we [settlers] built settlements was that we got stuck within the fences and couldn’t expand,” he told the crowd. “The farm is very important, but the most important thing for us is the surrounding area.” He claimed he now controls about 7,000 dunams (7 sq km) of land - an area greater than many large, urban settlements in the West Bank with populations in the thousands. Gaining control over large areas, often at the expense of Palestinian communities, is a key goal for some settlers who set up and live on outposts, says Hagit Ofran of Peace Now. “Settlers who live on the hilltop [outposts] see themselves as ‘protecting lands’ and their daily job is to kick out Palestinians from the area,” she says. Ayesha says that Moshe Sharvit began a campaign of harassment and intimidation almost as soon as he set up his outpost in late 2021. When her husband, Nabil, grazed his goats in pastures he had used for decades, Sharvit would quickly arrive in an all-terrain vehicle and he and young settlers would chase the animals away, he says. “I responded that we’d leave if the government, or police, or judge tells us to,” Nabil says. “He told me: ‘I’m the government, and I’m the judge, and I’m the police.’” Settlements Above The Law Extremist settlers are receiving money and land from powerful groups with ties to the Israeli government and are using it to build illegal settlement outposts, BBC Eye reveals. Watch on iPlayer or, if you are outside the UK, watch on YouTube West Bank: settlers, guns and sanctions  For more than six months, a BBC Eye team has been investigating extremist settlers establishing a new type of illegal settlement known as a “herding outpost”.  Listen now on BBC Sounds  Through limiting access to grazing land, outpost settlers like Moshe Sharvit are able to put Palestinian farmers in increasingly precarious positions, says Moayad Shaaban, the head of the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission. “It reaches a point where Palestinians don’t have anything anymore. They can’t eat, they can’t graze, can’t get water,” he says. Following the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel and Israel’s war in Gaza, Moshe Sharvit’s harassment became even more aggressive, says Ariel Moran, who supports Palestinian communities facing settler aggression. Sharvit had always carried a pistol with him in the fields, but now he began approaching activists and Palestinians with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder and his threats became more menacing, Ariel says. “I think he saw the chance of taking a shortcut and not waiting for another year or two years of gradually wearing them [Palestinian families] out.  “Just do it overnight. And it worked.” Many of the families, like Ayesha’s, who say they left their homes following threats from Moshe Sharvit, did so in the weeks immediately following 7 October. Throughout the West Bank, OCHA - the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - says settler violence has reached “unprecedented levels”.  In the past 10 months, it has recorded more than 1,100 settler attacks against Palestinians. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed and more than 230 injured by settlers since 7 October, it says. At least five settlers have been killed and at least 17 injured by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same time frame, OCHA says. In December 2023, two months after they say they were forced from their home, we filmed Ayesha and Nabil as they returned to collect some of their belongings. When they arrived at the house, they found it had been ransacked. In the kitchen, the cupboards hung from their hinges. In the living room, someone had taken a knife to the sofas, slashing through the upholstery. “I didn’t hurt him. I didn’t do anything to him. What have I done to deserve this?” Ayesha said. As they began to sort through the damage, Moshe Sharvit arrived in a buggy. Before long, the Israeli police and army arrived. They told the couple, and the Israeli peace activists accompanying them, that they had to leave the area. “He hasn’t left anything for us,” Ayesha told the BBC. We contacted Moshe Sharvit on multiple occasions to ask for his response to the allegations made against him, but he did not respond.  In July 2024, the BBC approached him in person at his outpost to seek his response to allegations and also to ask if he would allow Palestinians - like Ayesha - to return to the area. He said he didn’t know what we were talking about and denied that he was Moshe Sharvit.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd05pk95j2xo,UK suspends some arms exports to Israel,The foreign secretary says there is a risk some parts might be used to breach international law.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.624886,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UK has suspended some arms sales to Israel, saying there is a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would be suspending 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones.  An Israeli minister told the BBC that the decision sent the ""wrong message"" and was ""disappointing"", but human rights group Amnesty International UK called the suspension ""too limited"". Mr Lammy said the UK continued to support Israel's right to defend itself, and this did not amount to an arms embargo. Speaking to Radio 4, Israel's minister for diaspora affairs, Amichai Chikli, said the decision had come ""at a very sensitive moment"" when Israelis were burying six people ""murdered in Hamas tunnels"". ""I think we need to combat terrorism together,"" he told the World Tonight programme. ""The fight against Isis [the Islamic State group], and al-Qaeda and Hamas, it's the same war between the Western civilisation and radical Islam.  ""The threat that is coming from Hamas is also an inner threat that you are facing in the streets of the UK."" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in response to the decision that Israel operated according to international law. Writing on social media, the chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, said the move “beggars belief” and “feeds the falsehood that Israel is in breach of International Humanitarian Law”. “Sadly, this announcement will serve to encourage our shared enemies,” he added. Chief executive of Amnesty International UK, Sacha Deshmukh, criticised the restrictions as ""too limited and riddled with loopholes"". The non-profit organisation has continuously called for a ceasefire and to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.  “Today’s decision means that while ministers apparently accept that Israel may be committing war crimes in Gaza, [the government] is nevertheless continuing to risk complicity in war crimes, apartheid - and possible genocide - by Israeli forces in Gaza,"" he said. Western governments have been coming under growing pressure to halt arms sales to Israel over how it is waging the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The foreign secretary said many MPs, lawyers and international organisations had raised concerns about British arms export licensing to Israel. He immediately sought a review of British arms exports to Israel after the Labour government took office in July, Mr Lammy added. He said the review did not and “could not arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law” - and this was ""not a determination of innocence or guilt"". But he said the government had its own legal duty to review all exports licences. Mr Lammy said: ""The assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation on international humanitarian law.” He said the partial ban covered items ""which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza"". In a written summary of its decision, the government cited Israel's approach to Gaza aid and treatment of detainees as key factors in its decision. It did not explain how the suspended licences would affect these concerns.  But parts made in the UK for the F35 fighters that Israel is using to strike targets in Gaza will not be included in the UK's ban because the planes are manufactured as part of a global programme. The decision is more significant politically than militarily - UK arms sales to Israel are small, just 1% of the country’s defence imports. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, accounting for 69% of its imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But it is still striking that one of Israel’s closest allies has judged there is a clear risk the country may use some of its arms exports to violate international humanitarian law. The announcement may come as no surprise to the government of Israel – it has long been flagged - but it will still hurt. The discussion about suspending arms sales began under the last Conservative government but it came to a head under the new Labour administration. Labour said it had not changed its position on supporting Israel's security, which it describes as ""solid"" and ""unyielding"". But this marks the third time since Labour took power in July that they have deviated from the previous Tory government's approach. Two weeks into government, Labour announced it would resume funding UNRWA, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees following a review of alleged links between its staff and terror groups. Days later Labour announced it was dropping plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Labour government has called for an immediate ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages and an increase in the amount of aid to civilians in Gaza. Some backbench Labour MPs have been urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to go further and ban British arms sales to Israel completely. Labour lost a number of former strongholds to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Palestinian platforms in the general election. Already the government’s critics are saying the suspension has not gone far enough. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said her party would ""carefully scrutinise"" the details of the announcement, ""including those export licences which the government has not suspended"". ""We are concerned that the decision is made solely on risk of use in Gaza and not the West Bank,"" she added. Green MP Ellie Chowns asked why so many licences were exempt from the suspension. ""I am very concerned that the government is not consistently applying the principle that there is a clear risk of UK licensed weapons being used in breach of international humanitarian law,"" she said. But Conservative MPs - including the shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell - have criticised the decision. Mr Mitchell said the move had ""all the appearance of something designed to satisfy Labour’s backbenches, while at the same time not offending Israel, an ally in the Middle East"". ""I fear it will fail on both counts,"" he added. The Campaign Against Arms Trade says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel worth £574m ($727m) in total. Research by Parliament shows the value of licences granted has declined from £42m in 2022 to £18.2m in 2023."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdl3veg1l4o,Girl 'killed inside home' as Israeli West Bank operation continues,"The father of Lujain Musleh, 16, says she was shot by Israeli forces as she looked through a window.",4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.728004,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A funeral has been held for a 16-year-old Palestinian girl reportedly killed by Israeli forces in the north of the occupied West Bank on the seventh day of a wide-scale Israeli operation. Lujain Musleh’s father said she was shot in the head as she looked out of a window of her home in Kafr Dan, just outside Jenin, after soldiers surrounded a neighbouring house on Tuesday. The Israeli military said armed fighters fired at the soldiers and that they “fired back at a suspect who observed” them. The Palestinian health ministry says 30 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched what it called an operation to dismantle ""terrorist cells"". Most of the dead have been claimed by armed groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as members, but several children are also among them, according to the ministry. The Israeli military has said that one Israeli soldier has been killed. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Defence for Children Palestine (DCIP), a rights group, said Israeli soldiers entered Kafr Dan around 11:30 (09:30 BST) on Tuesday, prompting clashes with armed Palestinians. “Israeli soldiers surrounded and besieged the home of a wanted Palestinian man, firing live ammunition and shells at the house,” it said.  “Around 14:10, 16-year-old Loujain was inside her family’s home ... when an Israeli sniper shot her in the head through a window.” During a funeral procession for Loujain on Wednesday, her father, Osama, told reporters: ""She didn't go to the roof, she didn't hurl a stone, and she wasn't carrying a weapon.""  ""The only thing she did is look from the window and the soldier saw her and shot her."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said soldiers surrounded two civilian structures in Kafr Dan where they believed armed fighters were sheltering, and that they “called for civilians to evacuate from both structures prior to the exchange of fire that took place”. “During the encircling of the structures, the terrorists opened fire at IDF soldiers in the area, and in response the soldiers fired back at a suspect who observed the forces in the area, in order to remove a threat,” it added. “The IDF is aware of the report regarding a 16-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed during the exchange of fire. The details of the incident are under review.” Pictures from the funeral showed mourners carrying a body wrapped in a Hamas flag. The bodies of those killed by Israel are often wrapped in the flags of movements supported by friends or family members - even when the deceased are not supporters themselves.  DCIP also cited documentation it had collected which said a 14-year-old boy, Mohammed Kanaan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper on Tuesday morning at an entrance to the Tulkarm refugee camp, in Tulkarm city. The IDF said it was looking into that report. When asked by the BBC on Tuesday to comment on the reports of civilian deaths, the IDF said its forces operated in strict accordance with international law. “The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target civilians,” it added. “Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. The IDF will continue to counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians.” The IDF said its soldiers had killed two armed fighters during an exchange of fire in Tulkarm on Tuesday, and also located an explosive device in a baby stroller. On Monday evening, it announced that 14 “terrorists” had been killed in Jenin since the start of the operation and that 25 suspects had been detained. ""Every terrorist must be eliminated, and if they surrender, they must be arrested. There is no other option, use all the forces, everyone who is needed, with full strength,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told IDF officers on Wednesday. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa said on Tuesday that the losses caused by the raids, especially of infrastructure, might be the most extensive in two decades. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees expressed particular concern about Jenin, saying it had been “ravaged by violence and destruction”. Jenin’s streets have been so damaged that cars cannot pass some roads. Israeli bulldozers have destroyed many shops in the city centre, although those on the periphery were still open. The local municipality said the IDF had bulldozed more than 70% of streets, cut off water to 80% of the city, and damaged 20km (12 miles) of water, sewage, communications and electricity networks. The IDF said: “The terrorists in [the West Bank] exploit the civilian population and use them as human shields for murderous purposes, establishing terrorist infrastructures and planting explosives underneath traffic routes to harm the IDF troops in their attempts to thwart threats to the lives of Israeli citizens.” It also said it would work quickly to enable local authorities to repair damaged infrastructure and ensure the functionality of essential services. Israeli forces have also surrounded Jenin’s government hospital throughout the operation. Hospital director Dr Wisam Baker told the BBC on Monday that no-one could come in and out, including doctors like him travelling home, except in ambulances. Troops searched the vehicles and checked the IDs of those inside, he added. Ambulance drivers are “afraid” to bring wounded to the hospital or are delayed from entering because of searches, he said, adding the delay could put lives at risk. The hospital has been running on a generator, and 10 tanks of water are brought in each day, Dr Baker said. Ambulances have also been delivering food. Asked about the presence of troops outside the hospital, the IDF alleged that armed groups were exploiting medical and other facilities that were protected under international law. “The hospitals continue to operate as usual. In appropriate cases, inspections are conducted on those arriving at the hospital, provided that this does not prevent their treatment or endanger their health,” it said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its teams were “tirelessly providing humanitarian and emergency services to the besieged citizens in the Jenin camp, despite continuous obstructions by Israeli occupation forces, who are hindering [their] work.” On Monday, it said many Jenin residents were in urgent need of medicine, baby formula or food supplies, and that two paramedics and a volunteer doctor had been injured while on duty."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2np7p1yr7o,"Netanyahu not doing enough to free Gaza hostages, says Biden","The US is continuing to push for an agreement, as Israel is gripped by protests over hostage deaths.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.828019,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden has said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire with Hamas, amid reports that a new ""final"" proposal would be sent to the Israeli leader.  Mr Biden and Kamala Harris, his vice-president, met US negotiators to hammer out a proposal, as protests engulfed Israel on Monday after the discovery of six more hostage bodies in Gaza. Asked whether Mr Netanyahu was doing enough, Mr Biden replied ""no"". He added that the US would not give up, and would ""push as hard as we can"" for a deal.  US officials have characterised this latest proposal as a ""take it or leave it deal"", the Washington Post has reported. Among the bodies recovered from Gaza on Saturday was that of 23-year-old Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin.  He became one of the most recognisable hostages in the crisis after being seized by Hamas gunmen at a music festival in southern Israel on 7 October last year. The discovery of the bodies has caused widespread protests in Israel from those critical of Mr Netanyahu's handling of the war and hostage crisis.  On Monday, thousands of people joined a strike called by the country's biggest trade union, in an effort to put pressure on Mr Netanyahu to close out a deal.  Goldberg-Polin's funeral was held in Jerusalem on the same day, attended by thousands.  His mother Rachel - who also spoke at last month's Democratic convention in the US - described her torment. President Isaac Herzog offered an apology that his country had ""failed"" to protect Goldberg-Polin or bring him home. In comments of his own on the same day, Mr Netanyahu appealed to Israelis for ""forgiveness"" over the group's deaths.  Mr Biden said the US was ""devastated and outraged"" by the death of Mr Goldberg-Polin and the five others. ""Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,"" he said. Mr Biden spoke after Monday's meeting with negotiators in the White House Situation Room. US officials said he and Ms Harris discussed next steps in the effort to release of the hostages, including continuing talks with co-mediators Qatar and Egypt. Mr Biden is expected to present a ""final"" hostage release and ceasefire proposal later this week, according to the Axios website, which cited US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in conversation with the US families of remaining hostages. The US family of Edan Alexander, a member of the Israeli military who is still a hostage in Gaza, have pushed for Israel to accept the deal, saying it is ""now or never"". His father Adi Alexander praised the US for its ""dedication and commitment"" to secure a deal, saying that his meeting on Sunday was his 15th with Mr Sullivan since 7 October last year. But in an interview with BBC’s US partner CBS News on Monday, Mr Alexander appealed to US officials to ""do something different, because the outcome is the same after 11 months"". Mr Alexander accused Mr Netanyahu of ""prolonging the war for short-term political gain"". He added: ""Time is passing by and we're getting more bodies out of Gaza. This is unacceptable."" In its report, the Washington Post reported that the killing of the six hostages had increased the urgency among Mr Biden's aides to push for a deal. ""You can't keep negotiating this. This process has to be called at some point,"" one senior official told the newspaper. ""Does it derail the deal? No. If anything, it should add additional urgency in this closing phase, which we were already in,"" they added. The US, Qatar and Egypt have for months tried to secure a deal that includes a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The Biden administration has criticised Hamas for failing to agree to a deal, though US foreign officials have also accused Mr Netanyahu of making demands that have also derailed efforts. The war in the Gaza Strip began after the Hamas breached the Gaza boundary, killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted 251 in their attack last year. Israel has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians in retaliatory attacks, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The US response to the war has had implications for the Biden administration and Ms Harris, the Democratic nominee in November's US presidential election. Pro-Palestinian factions in the party have urged for a ceasefire.  Ms Harris's opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, has blamed Ms Harris and Mr Biden's failure to secure a deal for the hostage deaths last weekend."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l22jnj6go,Hostage killings leave Israeli protesters at 'breaking point',The discovery of six hostages killed in Gaza has increased the pressure on Israel's prime minister.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:51.930036,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Through the street outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house passed a slow procession of empty coffins - carried by protesters in a sea of Israeli flags. Since six Israeli hostages were found dead in a Gaza tunnel last weekend, the weight of the war there has hung heavier on Israel’s leader. Israel said Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino were shot and killed by Hamas shortly before Israeli troops made the discovery. “I think the fact that they were alive and murdered right before they could have been saved – that broke it,” said Anna Rubin, who joined a protest in Tel Aviv. “That’s a breaking point for a lot of people – [they] are on the edge of their seat, and they realise that sitting at home is not going to do anything.” Tens of thousands of people took to the streets again on Monday, after mass demonstrations flooded Tel Aviv last night. Many want to see this moment as a turning point, but Prime Minister Netanyahu has been here before. He’s lived through months of these street protests – and years of similar ones.  Protected by a parliamentary majority, his strategy has largely been to ignore their demands. But then, if Mr Netanyahu isn’t listening, many people in Israel are not protesting. A one-day general strike, called by the country’s labour union, was very patchily observed – even in Tel Aviv, the country’s beach-side liberal heartland. Shops and restaurants in the city centre were mostly open, after briefly closing in solidarity with the protest on Sunday night. “I don’t agree with the decision,” one of the staff at local cafe told me. “We should have closed.” Tamara was picking up a street scooter, in large shades and perfect lipstick. “I don’t agree with the strike,” she said. “We want the hostages back – but we can’t stop everything; we need to live.” Twenty-three-year-old Niva said she was surprised to see so many places open.  “The country is in a very confrontational mood now,” she said. But the most striking confrontation isn’t happening in the streets. In a live press conference on Monday night, Mr Netanyahu defied anyone to demand more concessions from Israel in its negotiations over a hostage and ceasefire deal, brokered by the US. ""These murderers executed six of our hostages; they shot them in the back of the head,” he said. “And now, after this, we’re asked to show seriousness? We’re asked to make concessions?” The message that would send to Hamas, he said, would be: “kill more hostages [and] you’ll get more concessions.” He said no-one who was serious about achieving peace and freeing the hostages – including US President Joe Biden – would ask him to make more concessions. A short while earlier, Mr Biden, when asked by reporters, said he didn’t think Israel’s prime minister was doing enough to secure a ceasefire deal. A key demand of Hamas is that Israel withdraws all its forces from a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. Israel’s security chiefs, including the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, have been widely reported in local media as supporting alternatives to keeping troops on the ground. Mr Gallant has publicly pressed the cabinet to back a proposed compromise. The most dangerous moment of Israel’s previous mass protests, sparked by Mr Netanyahu’s judicial reform plans, was when he tried to sack Mr Gallant – and was then forced to reinstate him. If he tried that again, says political analyst Tamar Hermann of Israel’s Democracy Institute, that could be the real turning point for protests here. The threat to him from demonstrators now, she says, is “zero”. Most are left-leaning critics whose opposition to the prime minister runs far deeper than the hostage crisis in Gaza. “Netanyahu knows better than I do,” she said, “the best thing is to let it play as a safety valve – let people say, ‘we hate you, you are a murderer’.” Prime Minister Netanyahu, protected by his parliamentary majority, seems to believe he can ride out the demands for a deal being made from the street, at least for now. But the demands from his own defence minister, from the US president, could prove harder to ignore."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20rgvqr37ro,Namibia blocks ship over Israel war-crime concerns,A vessel is suspected to be carrying military cargo intended for Israeli use in the ongoing war in Gaza.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:58.298206,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A vessel suspected by the Namibian authorities to be carrying military cargo intended for Israeli use in the ongoing war in Gaza has been blocked from docking in the southern African country. Namibian Justice Minister Yvonne Dausab told state media the ship was stopped because it had “explosive material destined for Israel"". The MV Kathrin, which set off from Vietnam, had requested permission to dock in the port of Walvis Bay – before sailing north, on a suspected route towards the Mediterranean via the Strait of Gibraltar. Rights groups had warned that Namibia could have been implicated in potential human rights violations had it allowed the vessel to dock. It is not known why the ship wanted to dock, but vessels on long journeys tend to stop for supplies, respite or to offload or take on cargo. Last December, Namibia’s neighbour and ally South Africa launched an ongoing case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel rejects the allegation of genocide as ""baseless"". The conflict began after Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The Israeli military then launched a campaign to destroy Hamas and more than 40,430 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Walvis Bay is Namibia’s largest commercial port, receiving nearly 900 vessels and handling about eight million tonnes of cargo per year, according to the Namibian Ports Authority (Namport). The MV Kathrin, which was set to dock at Walvis Bay on Monday from Vietnam, was stopped in accordance with Namibia's support for the Palestinian people and the country’s call for an end to the violence in Gaza, Ms Dausab told the state-run New Era news website.  Citing a police investigation, Ms Dausab said the vessel was ""indeed carrying explosive material destined for Israel, and was therefore prohibited from entering Namibian waters"". “Namibia complies with our obligation not to support or be complicit in Israeli war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, as well as its unlawful occupation of Palestine,” she said. Namibian human rights organisation the Economic and Social Justice Trust (ESJT) welcomed the move. ""We are pleased that our government has decided to respect international law and decided not to be complicit to genocide,"" ESJT's Herbert Jauch told the BBC. Namport has not responded to the BBC for comment about the MV Kathrin. Before Ms Dausab’s statement it said it had not received pre-clearance documentation for the ship. The agency however pledged to ensure ""effective safety and security of our territorial waters and ports"". It also said it supported Namibia's ""standing and position on international relations and protocols"". Namport said it had recently allowed another vessel carrying ""dangerous cargo"" to pass through Namibian waters, but not to dock. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze5x793569o,Tens of thousands rally in Israel calling for hostage release deal,The protests come after six hostages taken by Hamas on the 7 October attacks were found dead in Gaza.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:58.397094,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Tens of thousands of people have rallied across Israel after the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip were recovered by soldiers, causing national outrage. Protesters - many clad in Israeli flags - descended on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities, accusing PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his government of not doing enough to reach a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks.  Sunday's protests were largely peaceful - but crowds broke through police lines, blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv. This comes as a major Israeli labour union, Histadrut, called for a nationwide general strike on Monday, pressing for a hostage deal. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier that the six bodies were found on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. The hostages were identified as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino. The IDF said they had been killed shortly before its troops reached them on Saturday. This triggered Sunday's protests, with crowds accusing the government and Mr Netanyahu personally of failing to save the remaining hostages.   In Tel Aviv, protesters broke through police lines on to Ayalon Highway late on Sunday. Some people scaled buses and bins to gain a vantage point over the march, while others surrounded someone wearing a mask of Mr Netanyahu, chanting: “Alive, alive, we want them alive.”  One demonstrator held a sign which read: ""You are the head. You are to blame"".  Crowds also chanted slogans including ""policemen, policemen who are you protecting"" and ""shame, shame"".  Some set fires on the road and draped yellow ribbons - a symbol of solidarity with the hostages. Naama Lazimi, a Labor Party lawmaker, told the BBC she was lightly injured after police  let off stun grenades and she fell down.  She described the protests as “significant and important”. but said the “question is what happens tomorrow”. Among the protesters was Eli Shtivi, whose son Idan is being held hostage in Gaza. “We hope that those who make the decisions will wake up,” he told the BBC. “We don’t have time any more.” He said people from all strands of Israeli society took part in Sunday's rallies, united in wanting the hostages returned. “I miss my child so much. All the families are kind of hostages too,” Mr Shtivi said. Noga Burkman, another demonstrator in Tel Aviv, told the BBC she ""couldn't stay at home any more"".  ""People understand that now we need to break the rules and do something,"" she said, adding that ""tonight is just the beginning"".  Elsewhere, in the city itself, the gathering saw a diverse mix of protesters, with one group of young scouts leading chants.  In Jerusalem, a massive crowd of demonstrators gathered outside the prime minister's office.  One 50-year-old man told the BBC that the demonstrations were far bigger than any previous ones. ""It’s a totally different game today,"" he said. ""A different scale to anything before.""  Among those present at the protests in Tel Aviv was 24-year-old Yotam Peer, whose 21-year-old brother was killed on 7 October in the Hamas attacks. He told the BBC: ""After we heard about the six hostages, we couldn’t be silent any more. It’s really important. We don’t have a choice any more."" Local media reported that opposition leader Yair Lapid was present. The former prime minister, who leads the Yesh Atid party, earlier backed calls for a mass strike to force Mr Netanyahu into a deal over the release of the hostages.  Calling the general strike, union leader Arnon Bar-David said: ""We must reach a deal. A deal is more important than anything else."" He added: ""We are getting body bags instead of a deal."" Families of the hostages have been pushing for a nationwide strike as part of efforts to get a ceasefire agreement between Mr Netanyahu's government and Hamas for weeks. The Hostages Families Forum said that the six captives, whose bodies were recovered by Israeli military, were ""murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture and starvation in Hamas captivity"". ""The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,"" it said. The prime minister said he was committed to securing a deal that releases the remaining captives and protects the country's security. But he said: ""Whoever murders hostages does not want a deal."" The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was quick to condemn the general strike, claiming that it represented ""the interests of Hamas"".  But others have come forward in support. Tel Aviv's Mayor Ron Huldai announced that the city's municipal workers were free to join Monday's strike ""as a sign of solidarity with the abductees and their families"".   It is not clear how many hostages remain in Gaza. Hamas kidnapped 251 people and killed 1,200 others during an attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel launched a retaliatory military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. More than 40,530 people have been killed there since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y8zp8zdpzo,Family of aid worker killed in Gaza call for inquiry,"The family of James Kirby, who died in an Israeli strike, say they want accountability for his death.",4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:58.500836,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The family of a British aid worker killed in Gaza in April has urged the government to launch an independent legal inquiry into his death. James Kirby was one of three Britons killed in Israeli drone strikes on an aid convoy run by the World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity. Ahead of a memorial service for Mr Kirby at Bristol Cathedral on Wednesday, the family also criticised the government for not being in touch since his death and expressed their “surprise” at not receiving any contact or condolence from Israel’s ambassador to the UK or any Israeli official since the attack. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Israel's embassy in London called the incident ""a tragic mistake"" and expressed their ""deepest sorrow"" to James's family, adding that the IDF dismissed two people following an investigation into the incident. Speaking on behalf of the family, James’s cousin, Louise Kirby, said: “There must be a proper, independent inquiry into this attack on innocent aid workers, and for the evidence to be assessed, if appropriate, in a relevant court of law. “However, unfortunately, families have had no contact from the UK Government since James and his colleagues’ deaths, nor have we received any information as to whether a credible, independent investigation is taking place; or of the results of any investigation if it has taken place.” She added: “I very much hope the prime minister will take our concerns seriously and instigate an appropriate, independent or legal inquiry – not only so we can have transparency and accountability, but so that other British citizens and their families know that their government will act for them, if a foreign state unlawfully kills their loved ones.” James Kirby, 47, a former serviceman, was one of seven killed in the air strikes on an aid convoy run by WCK on 1 April.  Two other Britons – John Chapman, 57, and James Henderson, 33 – were also killed. They were providing security for the convoy moving food to a warehouse in Gaza. The IDF has said a drone operator mistakenly targeted the convoy after thinking it had been taken over by Hamas gunmen.  Three missiles were fired in three locations over five minutes. The first missile hit a car and some passengers escaped to another vehicle. That was then hit by a second missile. Some survivors tried to flee in a third car which was also struck. Everyone in the convoy was killed. After an internal investigation, the IDF sacked two officers and formally reprimanded two senior commanders.  The evidence from the investigation was passed to the military advocate general - the Israeli army's top legal authority - to determine if there had been any criminal conduct. A spokesperson for Israel’s embassy in London said: ""This incident was a tragic mistake and we express our deepest sorrow to James Kirby’s family, the other bereaved families, including those of John Chapman and James Henderson, and the entire World Central Kitchen team, who were doing such vital work in extremely challenging circumstances. ""As outlined by the IDF’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism (FFAM) in the in-depth independent investigation, conducted following the incident, a serious failure was made due to a mistaken identification as well as errors in decision-making. ""In light of this, a brigade fire support commander and brigade chief of staff were dismissed. Once again, we express our deepest condolences and sorrow to the families of the bereaved and the WCK team.” In the wake of the attack, the then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, called for a “thorough and transparent independent investigation” into what had happened. In the statement, Louise Kirby thanked friends and supporters – including WCK – for their support. She said the family had been touched to receive personal letters of condolence from the King and Queen and the former Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron. But she said “the murder” of James and his fellow aid workers was “a diabolical tragedy” and the family were “still struggling to find answers and accountability for what happened”. She said that, given Israel had said the strikes were an accident, the family had been surprised not to have had any contact or message of condolence from Israel’s ambassador to the UK, nor from any Israeli official.  ""Any family of a loved one who has been killed needs closure. We need to understand how this disaster could have happened,"" she said.  ""But this is not just about us. This is about how Britain looks after its own citizens and their families, when a British citizen has been unlawfully killed by another state.” Ms Kirby added: “We appreciate the compassion and respect we have been shown, but we must also have transparency and accountability. How did this happen? Who is responsible? What accountability did they face?  ""Just saying ‘sorry it was an accident’ is not enough. We need to know, and we need to know there has been accountability at all levels, so it never happens again.” A government spokesman said the bereaved families were being supported by police liaison support officers who were “regular contact” with the Foreign Office. “The death of James and his fellow aid workers was horrific and our thoughts remain with their families,” the spokesperson said.  “Attacks on aid workers are never justified and we remain fully committed to their protection as they support some of the most vulnerable people in the world.” “There must be an immediate ceasefire to protect civilians and aid workers, secure the release of all hostages and ensure much more aid gets into Gaza. Israel must guarantee the protection of aid workers and ensure a tragedy like this cannot happen again.” The spokesperson did not address the families’ demand for an independent inquiry. Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza  in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October during which about 1,200 were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgez7ez10lo,Israel disruption as strike and protests push for Gaza hostage deal,Tensions are running high over the government's failure to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:58.603156,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's biggest trade union has said hundreds of thousands of people joined the general strike it called to put pressure on the government to agree a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. Businesses, schools and transport were disrupted before a court ordered everyone to return to work, ruling that Histadrut’s strike was largely political. Thousands also took part in fresh protests called by hostages' families to express their anger at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to bring home their loved ones after almost 11 months. Tensions have been running high since the bodies of six hostages were found on Saturday. Israel said they were shot and killed by Hamas. Many accuse Mr Netanyahu of blocking a deal to prioritise his own political survival - a claim he rejects. His far-right allies have threatened to pull out of the coalition government, undermining his chances of staying in power, if he were to accept a deal tied to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas was destroyed. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,780 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 97 hostages still being held, including 33 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. When asked by reporters in Washington if he thought Mr Netanyahu was doing enough to secure an agreement, US President Joe Biden replied: “No.” He spoke after meeting American mediators who he said “very close” to presenting what US media described as a final proposal to Israel and Hamas. Histadrut spokesman Peter Lerner told the BBC on Monday morning that there was disruption across the private and public sectors of the Israeli economy after the general strike began at 06:00 local time (03:00 GMT). Suitcases were “piling up at Ben Gurion International Airport”, that ports were “slowing their activity”, and that some municipalities were participating, he said. A Ben Gurion airport spokeswoman said it was operating “as usual”, although Israeli media reported that departures were stopped for two hours in the morning. There was also scattered evidence of the strike in the nearby city of Tel Aviv. Most shops and restaurants appeared to be open, some buses were running, and there were many people out in the streets and cafes. One cafe worker told the BBC that almost all the bars and restaurants in the area had shut on Sunday night in solidarity with the protests, but that they had now reopened. “I don’t agree with the decision,” she said. “We should have closed.” Another woman, who was picking up a street scooter, said: “I don’t agree with the strike. We want the hostages back - but we can’t stop everything; we need to live.” Later, the Labour Court in Tel Aviv ruled that the strike had to end at 14:30 (11:30 GMT), following a request for an injunction from the government. The court said the strike had no economic basis and was largely political. Histadrut’s chairman, Arnon Bar-David, said he respected the ruling but also defended the strike. “Despite attempts to paint this solidarity in political colours, hundreds of thousands of citizens voted with their feet,” he said. “We have proven that the fate of the hostages is neither right-wing nor left-wing; it is a matter of life or death, and we will not allow lives to be abandoned. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Israelis had gone to work “in droves” and proven that they were no longer slaves to “political needs”. “We won’t allow harm to the Israeli economy and thereby serve the interests of [Yahya] Sinwar and Hamas,” he said, referring to the Palestinian armed group's leader. Members of the Gevurah Forum, which represents some families of soldiers killed during the war and opposes the proposed hostage deal, protested against the strike outside the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem. “Shutting down the economy is a prize for Hamas,” they chanted, according to the Times of Israel. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right leader, told the crowd: “Today, we have power in the government, and I'm not ashamed to say that we're using this power to prevent a reckless deal and to stop any negotiations altogether.” The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents some hostages’ families, meanwhile called for fresh demonstrations to demand an immediate deal. Israeli media reported that thousands of people protesters took to the streets in several cities. Large crowds blocked a highway in central Tel Aviv, while six yellow wreaths bearing the word “sorry” were also laid in what has become known as Hostages’ Square. The Hostages Families Forum said it was a message to the hostages whose bodies were found by Israeli forces in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza on Saturday - Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said all six were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them”. The Israeli health ministry said post mortem examinations showed that they had died between 48 and 72 hours before they were found, which would be between Thursday and Friday morning, and that they had been shot and killed with “several close-range gunshots"". Hamas has rejected that charge, saying the hostages were killed by Israeli forces. Following the discovery of the bodies, some families said Mr Netanyahu had their loved ones’ blood on his hands. At Sunday night’s protests - the biggest in Israel since the start of the war, with hundreds of thousands demonstrating across the country - there were chants of “murderer”. Others chanted: “Alive, alive, we want them alive.” The protests were largely peaceful, but crowds broke through police lines and blocked a major highway in Tel Aviv. The police force said 29 people were arrested. Sharone Lifschitz - whose 84-year-old father Oded is among the remaining hostages - told the BBC: “We have asked the citizens of Israel for months to join us on the streets. They have now joined us on the streets. This is an incredible development.” “I want the government of Israel to look beyond the narrow interests of their own political parties and their own survival, and do the decent thing and find a way to bring these people home, to finish and reach a ceasefire. We know that we have no time,” she said. Mr Netanyahu reiterated in a video statement on Sunday that Israeli negotiators had agreed to a hostage release deal at the end of May which Hamas had rejected. “In recent days, as Israel has been holding intensive negotiations with the mediator in a supreme effort to reach a deal, Hamas is continuing to steadfastly refuse all proposals,” he said. “Even worse, at the exact same time, it murdered six of our hostages. Whoever murders hostages - does not want a deal.” Hamas blamed the hostages’ deaths on Israel and the United States, accusing them of issuing new demands for a deal, including for lasting Israeli control over the strategic Philadelphi corridor, a narrow buffer zone which runs along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. “The six hostages and others could have been released to their families as part of a real exchange deal while they were alive, but the insistence of the occupation army, Netanyahu and his extremist government is the reason why these people lost their lives,” Hamas political bureau member Khalil al-Hayya said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0rer2k01no,Met admits making mistakes on Palestine protests,"The Met Police says about 52,000 officers' shifts were needed for protests between October and June.",9 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:58.699439,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Metropolitan Police ""didn't get everything right"" and could have made arrests sooner when policing recent large-scale protests, the force's assistant commissioner has said. Speaking to the authors of a report by the Policy Exchange think tank in May, Matt Twist said this was true ""particularly in the early stages in October"".  Asked to comment on the report by the BBC, he said that ""months of protests have had a cumulative impact on London and its communities"".  Palestine-related protests in London between October 2023 and June have cost the Metropolitan Police almost £43m and needed almost 52,000 officers, according to its own estimates as revealed by the London Assembly. The right-wing think tank said its report revealed the impact of ""a new era of increasingly disruptive protests"" on public service finances, public tourism and retail. Mr Twist said a ""significant demand"" had been placed on the Met, adding: ""Each event presents a policing challenge and requires a substantial amount of planning and resource. ""Our priority has always been to keep people safe, balancing the lawful right to protest with the impact on the wider community."" The Policy Exchange report said that current legislation required protest organisers only to provide six days' notice to the police of their intention to stage a march. As a result, final plans for the event were often only provided to the public the day before, or on the day of a march, which was ""simply unreasonable for the public to be required to continually adapt"", the report said. It also found that in nearly a third of cases, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) chose not to prosecute suspects in public order cases based on ""public interest"" grounds. Speaking to the think tank in May, Mr Twist told it that the protests represented a ""very real policing challenge"". He added: ""On occasion we did not move quickly to make arrests, for example the man chanting for 'jihad' which was a decision made following fast-time advice from lawyers and the CPS."" He told the Policy Exchange that the force was now ""much more focused on identifying reasonable grounds for arrest"". There have been frequent protests across the UK since October. These include marches organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) that called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, as well as environmental campaigns by Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. After three young girls were killed in an attack in Southport on 29 July, many protests also descended into rioting and disorder. For its report, the Policy Exchange conducted a nationwide poll of more than 1,500 adults. It found that more than two thirds of respondents would drop plans to travel with small children or an elderly or mobility-impaired friend or relative on the day of a major protest in a nearby city or town. More than 60% said they would abandon plans to visit a tourist attraction and more than half would cancel plans to go shopping. The Policy Exchange's report made 26 recommendations, among them a call on the government to change the criteria to prohibit a protest march under section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986 to include assessing the potential for ""serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". It also called for a Protest Commission for London to be established and appointed by the home secretary. The Met should impose ""more stringent"" conditions on protest marches, the report also recommended. Former Met Commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe, who endorsed the report, said: ""In recent years the policing of protest has become increasingly challenging for police commanders and officers on the ground. ""We regularly see police officers demonstrating conspicuous courage and for that they deserve our gratitude and respect."" He called on the government to ""rebalance the legal regime in favour of ordinary members of the public going about their daily lives"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02pz4wnyro,Netanyahu asks 'forgiveness' over hostage deaths as protests continue,"It comes as Hamas said more hostages could be ""returned to their families in shrouds"" if a ceasefire isn't reached.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:58.803249,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Benjamin Netanyahu has asked for ""forgiveness"" from Israelis for failing to return six hostages found dead in Gaza on Saturday, as Hamas warned more could be ""returned to their families in shrouds"" if a ceasefire isn't reached. His comments came as intense street protests over his handling of negotiations entered a second night in Israel. Pressure also mounted internationally as the UK suspended some arms sales to Israel, citing a risk of equipment being used to violate international law. But Israel's prime minister struck a defiant tone, insisting its troops must control Gaza's Philadelphi Corridor - a strategically important strip of land which is a sticking point in negotiations with Hamas. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday in fresh protests called by hostages' families to express their anger at Mr Netanyahu's failure to bring home their loved ones after almost 11 months.  The Times of Israel reported that police were using considerable aggression at one protest outside the prime minister’s home in Jerusalem, including violently pushing protesters, throwing some to the ground, and dragging many away. One member of the police squeezed the throat of a Times of Israel reporter, according to the newspaper. The latest demonstrations come after hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in protests across the country on Sunday, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv. Many wore Israeli flags and hung yellow ribbons - a symbol of solidarity with the hostages - from a bridge overlooking the Ayalon Highway.  A total of 97 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October last year. Hamas said on Monday that hostages would be returned ""inside coffins"" if military pressure from Israel continues and added that ""new instructions"" have been given to militants guarding captives if they are approached by Israeli troops.  ""Netanyahu's insistence to free prisoners through military pressure, instead of sealing a deal means they will be returned to their families in shrouds. Their families must choose whether they want them dead or alive,"" a spokesperson for the group said, without elaborating on what new orders had been issued.  Earlier on Monday, Israel's biggest trade union said hundreds of thousands of people had joined a general strike called to put pressure on the government to agree a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. Despite this, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport reported limited disruption and many restaurants and hospitality services operated as normal. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich boasted that Israelis had gone to work “in droves” and proved that they were no longer slaves to “political needs”. Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden said Mr Netanyahu was not doing enough to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire with Hamas, amid reports suggesting a new proposal would be sent to the Israeli prime minister as ""final"". Many accuse Mr Netanyahu of blocking a deal to prioritise his own political survival - a claim he rejects. Mr Netanyahu's far-right allies have threatened to pull out of the coalition government, undermining his chances of staying in power, if he were to accept a deal tied to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas was destroyed. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 97 hostages still being held, including 33 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday that the UK had suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, citing a ""clear risk"" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. The affected equipment includes parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Mr Lammy said the UK continued to support Israel's right to defend itself, and this did not amount to an arms embargo. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant posted on X, to say he was ""deeply disheartened"" by the move, while Foreign Minister Israel Katz said it sent a ""very problematic message"" to Hamas and Iran. Meanwhile, funeral services for some of the hostages killed on Saturday have been held.  The mother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin - one of the hostages whose body was recovered by Israel on Saturday - spoke at his funeral and said she had been in ""such torment and worry"" about him for months. Rachel Goldberg-Polin said it had been a ""stunning honour"" to be her son’s mother. Around the time of his kidnap, Hersh sent two texts to his family, writing: ""I love you guys,” and ""I’m sorry"". Mourners lined the streets in Jerusalem and Israel's President Isaac Herzog spoke to relatives at the funeral.  The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Julian Gao, Ruby Hamill, Daniel Jones and Sayed Shah were arrested after staging a protest at the Teledyne factory in Shipley, which specialises in supplying electronics to the aerospace and defence sectors. Following the incident all four were charged with causing criminal damage and having articles with intent to destroy or damage property. However, after a trial at Bradford Crown Court the jury failed to reach verdicts on any of the charges. All four defendants will face a re-trial at the same court in February 2026. At the start of the trial the jury was shown CCTV footage of the group using an angle-grinder to cut through a security fence in the early hours of 2 April. The group was filmed carrying items including sledgehammers, crowbars, ladders and flags and staging a protest on the roof of the premises. The three men and a woman, who were wearing red boiler suits, were then captured on drone footage smashing roof tiles and windows. When police officers arrived they challenged the group on the roof and were told they were protesting at the site due to the war in Gaza, the court heard. Prosecutor Gerald Hendron told the court the total damage caused externally and internally to the premises had been £571,383. Teledyne Space and Defence Ltd supplies the defence and aerospace industry. Mr Hendron said components were used in the manufacture of weapons used by the British Army and NATO, as well as weapons purchased by other countries such as Ukraine and Israel. On Friday, after about seven hours of deliberation over two days, Judge Sophie McKone asked the jury if they would be able to reach verdicts if they were given more time. When the forewoman indicated they would not, the judge thanked them for their attention during the trial and formally discharged them. Mr Gao, 20, of Dalton Ellis Hall, Manchester, Mr Shah, 51, of Reedley Road, Burnley, Mr Jones, 30, of Rossett Road, Crosby, and 20-year-old Ms Hamill, of Emu Road, London, have all been bailed ahead of their next appearance.

The Guardian says the UK has broken with the US by changing its policy on weapon exports. The i says the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, has ""sent a stark message"" to the Israeli government.  In an editorial, the Times calls the measure a ""PR exercise"", which is ""designed to insulate Labour from any domestic fallout"". But the Daily Mirror says that continuing to supply the arms ""would have risked contributing to war crimes"".  The website of the Jewish Chronicle says Jewish and pro-Israel groups have reacted with disappointment. It quotes the Jewish Leadership Council as saying that ""when the bodies of the six murdered hostages are still being buried, it is more important than ever for the UK to stand by its ally"". The Daily Mail says the Conservatives have accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of ""running scared"" from giving MPs a say on plans to axe winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. The paper says government sources have indicated ministers would reject calls for a Commons debate and vote. Sir Keir has defended the cut, which he says is needed to fill a £22bn ""black hole"" in the public finances. The Daily Express leads with Kemi Badenoch's pitch to lead the Conservatives. Its editorial says the shadow communities secretary has ""got off to a strong start"". The paper says that among some ""very strong candidates"" for the leadership, she has ""some of most the visionary plans"" to heal what it describes as a ""wounded party"". The Financial Times describes her campaign launch speech as ""policy-light"". One of Britain's biggest car dealerships, Vertu Motors, has told the Daily Telegraph that manufacturers are delaying deliveries of petrol vehicles to avoid fines. The company suggests that carmakers are ""rationing"" them so they don't exceed yearly quotas set by the government, which are designed to increase the proportion of electric vehicle sales. It tells the paper that customers ordering a petrol or hybrid vehicle today at some dealerships will have to wait until February for their cars to be delivered. Several papers cover the continuing complaints about inflated ticket prices for the Oasis comeback tour. Under the headline ""Pulling the plug on Oasis wonder-haul"", the Mirror says the prime minister has hinted the law could change to stop event companies from charging more when demand surges.  The Times' headline says ""some might say it's too late"". The article quotes consumer group Which? as saying the high level of demand for Oasis tickets was ""clear from the outset"". Finally, the Sun says football pundit and former player Alan Shearer had to ""hide"" for four hours on a train to avoid hundreds of fans of Sunderland - arch rivals of his old club, Newcastle. Shearer told The Rest is Football podcast he'd got on a busy carriage on his way home from a wedding on Saturday, only to realise it was also full of Sunderland supporters coming back from an away game against Portsmouth.  The paper says he hid his face under a cap and was ""petrified"" when jubilant fans started singing about him and his former club.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wj9qejrpwo,What the world thought of US debate,"How the Harris-Trump debate was seen from Putin's Kremlin, Ukraine's frontlines and Taliban-run Afghanistan.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:59.113485,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The first showdown between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was closely watched not only in the US but around the world. The debate in Philadelphia featured some tense exchanges on foreign policy between the two presidential candidates. From Beijing to Budapest, here's how the debate went down, according to BBC foreign correspondents. By Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor, Moscow Kamala Harris told Donald Trump that President Putin is “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.” The expression ""to eat someone for lunch"" (or breakfast, or any other meal) doesn’t exist in Russian. But one thing you will find in Moscow is the appetite for a US election result that benefits Russia. The Kremlin will have noted (with pleasure) that in the debate Trump sidestepped the question about whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. “I want the war to stop,” replied Trump. By contrast, Harris spoke of Ukraine’s “righteous defence” and accused Vladimir Putin of having “his eyes on the rest of Europe”. Later the Kremlin claimed to have been irked by all mentions of Putin in the debate. “Putin’s name is used as one of the instruments for the internal battle in the US,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told me. ""We don’t like this and hope they will keep our president’s name out of this.” Last week Putin claimed he was backing Harris in the election and praised her “infectious laugh.” Later a Russian state TV anchor clarified that Putin had been “slightly ironic” in his comments. The presenter was dismissive of Harris’ political skills and suggested she would be better off hosting a TV cooking show. I wonder: would it feature “dictators” eating US presidential candidates “for lunch""…? By Nick Beake, Europe correspondent, Kyiv Donald Trump’s failure, when asked on the debate stage to say if he wanted Ukraine to win the war, may not have surprised people here but it adds to their worry about what a second Trump term would bring. Trump has long boasted he could end in the conflict in 24 hours, a prospect many Ukrainians assume would mean an incredibly bad deal with Kyiv forced to give up huge swathes of the land Russia has seized over the past two and a half years. In contrast, Ukrainians will have been reassured by Kamala Harris’s responses, with no sign she would deviate from the current position of staunch American support. She took credit for the role she’s already played, arguing she shared important intelligence with President Zelensky in the days before the full-scale invasion. She then claimed Trump’s position would have been fatal for Ukraine had he still been in the White House. “If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.” Publicly, there has been a deafening silence from Ukraine’s current ministers and senior military in reaction to the debate. The figurative US electoral battle is one they need not weigh in to while they’re consumed by real fighting at home. It’s President Zelensky himself who so far has gone furthest in articulating, albeit somewhat euphemistically, what a Trump victory would mean for Ukrainians. Speaking to the BBC in July, he said it would mean “hard work, but we are hard workers”. By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent America’s longest war ended in August 2021 when it scrambled to pull out the last of its troops, and evacuate thousands of civilians, as the Taliban swept into Kabul with surprising speed. That debacle made it into the debate and, not surprisingly, the issues were dodged, dismissed, distorted. Harris veered away from the question “do you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?”. As a correspondent who followed the chaotic pullout closely, I never heard that the vice-president was in the room when decisions were taken in those final fateful weeks. But she made it clear she agreed with President Biden’s decision to leave. Trump boasted that he talked tough with “Abdul”, the “head of the Taliban” who is “still the head of the Taliban.” He seemed to be referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the withdrawal deal with the US. But he never headed the Taliban, and has been sidelined since the Taliban takeover. The mention immediately prompted a wave of internet memes featuring “Abdul” with people named Abdul weighing in, and others asking “who is Abdul?” Both contenders focused on the flawed deal with the Taliban. The truth is that the Trump team negotiated this exit plan; the Biden team hastily enacted it. Trump said the deal was good because “we were getting out”. There were no good ways to go. But the departure turned into a disaster and all sides are to blame. By Laura Bicker, China correspondent, Beijing Kamala Harris was an unknown quantity to leaders here and she still is, even after the debate. She has no track record on China and on the debate stage she simply repeated her line that the US, not China, would win the competition for the 21st Century. The vice-president represents something China does not like - uncertainty. That is why President Xi recently used a visit by US officials to call for “stability” between the two superpowers, perhaps a message to the current vice-president. The prevailing view among Chinese academics is that she will not stray too far from President Biden’s slow and steady diplomatic approach. But on the debate stage she went on the attack and accused Donald Trump of “selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernise their military”. Donald Trump has made it clear he plans has to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This will add to the tariffs he imposed as president which started a trade war in 2018. China retaliated, and numerous studies suggest this caused economic pain for both sides. This is the last thing China wants right now as it is trying to manufacture and export goods to rescue its economy. For Chinese leaders, this debate will have done little to assuage beliefs that Trump represents something else they don’t like - unpredictability. But in truth, there is little hope here that US policy on China will change significantly, no matter who sits in the White House. By Paul Adams, international correspondent, Jerusalem The two candidates did not stray much from their previously stated positions last night, even if Trump did add, with characteristic hyperbole, that Israel wouldn’t exist in two years if his opponent becomes president. Here in the Middle East, the race for the White House is being keenly watched. With the war in Gaza raging and a ceasefire deal still elusive, some of Benjamin Netanyahu’s critics suspect that Israel’s prime minister is deliberately stalling until after the election, in the hope that Trump will be more sympathetic to Israel than Harris. There’s a whiff of history perhaps being about to repeat itself. In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s campaign team was suspected of urging Iran not to release American hostages held in Tehran until after he had beaten President Jimmy Carter, saying Reagan would give Iran a better deal. Could something similar be afoot now? Certainly Netanyahu’s opponents believe he is now the chief obstacle to a ceasefire deal. Harris has indicated that she might be tougher on Israel than Joe Biden, something Trump has seized on, saying last night that the vice-president “hates Israel”. Palestinians, deeply sceptical about Donald Trump but dismayed by the Biden administration’s inability to stop the war in Gaza, are possibly inclined to see Harris as the lesser of two evils. They’ve long since abandoned any notion of the US as an honest broker in the Middle East, but will have noticed that Harris, unlike Trump, says she’s committed to Palestinian statehood. By Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent, Budapest Donald Trump showered praise on the Hungarian prime minister. ""Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men, they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart..."" Hungarian pro-government media picked up on the compliment. ""Huge recognition!"" ran the headline in Magyar Nemzet. But government-critical news portal 444 quoted Tim Walz, running mate of Harris. ""He [Trump] was asked to name one world leader who was with him, and he said Orban. Dear God. That's all we need to know.’ Viktor Orban backed Trump for president in 2016 and is strongly backing him again in November.  The two men met for the second time this year at Trump’s home in Florida on 12 July, after Orban visited Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in quick succession. The Orban government is banking both on Trump’s victory and his ability to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. ""Things are changing. If Trump comes back, there will be peace. It will be established by him without the Europeans,"" Balazs Orban, Viktor Orban’s political director, told the BBC in July."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce31ddege9vo,Israel recovers bodies of six Gaza hostages,The Israeli military says the captives were killed by Hamas shortly before troops discovered them in the Rafah area.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.415278,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel says its forces have recovered the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies were located on Saturday in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. The IDF named the hostages as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino. Spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said an initial assessment was they were ""brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them"". A senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq, insisted Israel was responsible for their deaths, as it has refused to sign a ceasefire deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not rest until those responsible for their killing are brought to justice. In a statement, he also said his government was committed to achieving a deal to release those remaining in captivity and protects the country's security.  ""Whoever murders hostages - does not want a deal,"" he added. A group representing the families of those held hostage in Gaza has demanded that  Mr Netanyahu ""address the nation and take responsibility for abandoning the hostages"". The Hostages Families Forum said that all six held captive were ""murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity"". ""The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,"" they added in a statement. The group has also announced plans to ""bring the nation to a halt"" on Sunday, asking the Israeli public to join protests in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel to call for a hostage exchange deal. One of Israel's most prominent opposition politicians, Yair Lapid, joined the calls for a general strike to put renewed pressure on the government to agree a deal. He accused Mr Netanyahu's ""cabinet of death"" of deciding against saving the hostages to avoid conflict with his far-right allies in government.  ""He prefers saving the coalition with [Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich] and [National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir], rather than saving our children's lives. This blood is on their heads"", Mr Lapid added. A Bedouin Arab man rescued in Gaza last week by Israeli troops urged Israel to reach a deal with Hamas to free all the remaining hostages. After returning to his village in southern Israel on Wednesday, Kaid Farhan Elkadi said his ""happiness is not complete so long as there are detainees here and there”. “Every one of them, whether Arab or Jewish, has a family waiting for them and everyone wants to be happy,” he added. In its statement on Sunday morning announcing the deaths of the hostages, the IDF said the bodies had been ""returned to Israeli territory"". ""They were all taken hostage on 7 October [2023] and were murdered by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip."" The statement added that their families had already been notified. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the ""heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces with the news"" of their killing.  ""On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,"" he added. Sharone Lifschitz, whose father Oded is being held in Gaza, said the hostages were killed because of delays in getting a deal  She also accused the Israeli government and Hamas of placing ""more and more obstacles"" in the way of reaching an agreement. Ms Lifschitz's mother Yocheved was released in the November 2023 hostage exchange, in which more than 100 people were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Meanwhile, after the death of Mr Goldberg-Polin - an American citizen - was confirmed, US President Joe Biden said he was ""devastated and outraged"" by the news. He said in a statement that ""Hersh was among the innocents brutally attacked while attending a music festival for peace in Israel on 7 October"".  ""He lost his arm helping friends and strangers during Hamas’ savage massacre.  He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world.  ""I have gotten to know his parents, Jon and Rachel. They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,"" Mr Biden said. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed shock at the ""horrific and senseless killing of six hostages in Gaza by Hamas"". ""Hamas must release all the hostages now, and a ceasefire deal must be agreed by all sides immediately to end the suffering,"" he added in a post on X. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,738 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 97 hostages still being held - including at least 33 who are presumed dead - in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. It comes as a UN-led multi-day polio vaccination campaign gets under way in Gaza, following the discovery of the potentially deadly virus in wastewater samples earlier this summer. Three ""humanitarian pauses"" in the fighting - beginning on Sunday - have been agreed between Israel and Hamas so that officials can vaccinate around 640,000 children under the age of 10 The move comes after the first infection in more than 25 years was detected in a 10-month-old Palestinian child last month."

The defendants are charged with damaging property and having articles with intent to destroy or damage property, including but not limited to crowbars and sledgehammers. The prosecution told Bradford Crown Court that at 05:30 BST on the morning of the protest, the four defendants used angle grinders which caused ""sparks"" as they cut through the gate to Teledyne's Shipley site. They were then said to have gained access to the roof of the building using a ladder.  The jury was shown video footage of four people at the site, who the prosecution said were the defendants. Mr Hendron said: ""The footage shows the defendants cutting their way through the fence and climbing onto the roof."" The four defendants were seen to be laughing to each other in court as the footage was played to the jury. According to the prosecution, more footage seen by the jury showed Mr Jones, of Rossett Road, Crosby, Sefton, and Miss Hamill, of Emu Road in London, Wandsworth, smashing a window to the building. Meanwhile, further footage was shown, which the prosecution said depicted Mr Jones holding a sledgehammer tied to a rope down a hole in the roof and swinging it from side to side. Another video was shown to the jury of Mr Gao, of Dalton Ellis Hall, Manchester, speaking in front of a Palestinian flag following the incident.   In the video, he said: ""Britain has the ability to stop this genocide. If they won't do it, we will."" He explained the protesters' goal was to have ""no more British weapons in the hands of Israeli soldiers"". Mr Gao warned ""imperialists and oppressors"" that ""you are not safe"" and ""your days are numbered"". The jury also saw footage of another man, who the prosecution said was Mr Shah, of Reedley Road, Reedley, Burnley, saying: ""You look so upset about some tiles, man. The whole of Gaza is being carpet-bombed."" Mr Hendron told the court that Teledyne ""provided components for the defence and aerospace industries"". He added that ""through British arms export licences"", those components were used ""by countries including Ukraine and Israel"". The prosecution said the defendants were on the roof of the Teledyne factory in Shipley for about 14 hours and caused £571,383 worth of damage. Mr Hendron told the jury: ""The defendants gave 'no comment' answers when questioned by police."" The trial continues.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3dnn7zlyo,Columbia University term starts with protests and security,"A statue was doused with red paint and there were at least two arrests, but police described the day as ""peaceful"".",4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.587096,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Columbia University students began the school year with fresh protests and increased security just outside their famous New York City campus.  Last term, the Ivy League college saw some of the largest and tensest campus demonstrations in the US as students protested against Israel's military operation in Gaza. On Tuesday, the first day of term, all eyes were on the demonstrators who gathered at the school gates to see whether they would reflect the scale of the earlier protests.  Police said there were at least two arrests on Tuesday, but characterised the gatherings as ""peaceful"".  Pro-Palestinian protesters - many of their faces covered in traditional keffiyeh scarves - could be heard several blocks from the site of the demonstration on Tuesday morning. They chanted ""Free Palestine"" as they banged on drums and marched in circles outside Columbia University's famous iron gates.  On the other side of metal barricades, students and staff watched the demonstration as they queued up to have their identification thoroughly checked before they could enter campus. Inside, the biggest disruption occurred around noon on Tuesday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The Alma Mater statue outside Low Memorial Library was doused with red paint - allegedly by protesters. The area was reportedly blocked off, as a crew worked to clean the statue.  Columbia’s previous academic year concluded with the New York Police Department raiding a pro-Palestinian encampment that had taken over the campus quad. Student protesters then briefly occupied an academic building that police ultimately cleared, leading to more than 100 arrests.  The school cancelled its main graduation and the student body left for the summer under a cloud of deep unease.  Last month Minouche Shafik  - who served as Columbia's president during the encampment and permitted the police raid - resigned. On Tuesday, the pro-Palestinian protesters asked the returning students to remember why they had demonstrated during the last academic year.  “We ask that you put aside your excitement for a new school year and remember the Palestinians who died by our very dollars,” read a flier that the protesters distributed. Multiple protesters declined the BBC’s interview requests on Tuesday, and participants were generally unwilling to speak to the press. By mid-afternoon, the pro-Palestinian demonstration concluded - though protesters chanted: ""We'll be back."" Most students on Tuesday appeared unfazed by the demonstrators. Several excitedly greeted each other, hugging after a summer apart. Two students manoeuvred a flatscreen television through protesters and metal security barriers. Stephanie Lee, a 28-year-old graduate student studying business, said she expected there to be protests, but she felt ""OK"" on her first day on campus. “Security is pretty good,"" she added.  Rachel Black, a freshman from North Carolina, said that she saw the protests as a welcome part of her overall experience at Columbia University. “I’m interested in becoming more educated,” she said. “I’m hoping to learn what the conflict [is] about.” Columbia University spokesperson Samantha Slater did not acknowledge the protests in a statement provided to BBC News.  ""As we begin the new semester, we are focused on our mission of teaching, creating, and advancing knowledge and ensuring a safe, respectful campus environment for our community.""  Multiple protests and counter-protests have been staged at Columbia University since Hamas’s attack in Israel on 7 October, 2023. The attack left about 1,200 people dead, while 251 people were taken hostage. About 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began a retaliatory military campaign that has drawn international criticism. On Sunday, Israel announced it had recovered the bodies of six of the hostages who were taken to Gaza. Among them was 23-year-old Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose parents waged a public campaign calling for his release. David Lederer, a 22-year-old junior at Columbia University, held a small-counter protest along with a fellow Jewish student outside the university gates on Tuesday. His friend held a photo of Goldberg-Polin, and the two unfurled a large banner that read “Get Support for Terrorism Off Our Campus”. Mr Lederer - who was sworn at by one passerby - is one of several pro-Israel Jewish students who have expressed concern about antisemitism on campus. They said the pro-Palestinian groups had not sufficiently condemned the 7 October attack or its perpetrators. “To be anti-war is one thing, but to be pro a terrorist organisation is another, and that has no place at Columbia,” Mr Lederer said."

It says some patients were left with life-changing injuries such as amputations and deformities.  The Times has seen a leaked report by the Royal College of Surgeons, which criticises the department where the surgeon worked as ""dysfunctional"".  The consultant, who now works in Dubai, has declined to comment. Great Ormond Street has apologised and promised to address the findings of the review. The Sunday Express says Sir Keir Starmer faces a ""revolt"" by Labour MPs, angry about his decision to cut winter fuel payments.  The paper quotes the Labour MP Rosie Duffield who told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the decision was ""brutal"" and ""shameful"".  The Express says Sir Keir is working to keep a lid on party in-fighting.  The report carries a comment from the former Conservative work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, who warns the move could hurt Sir Keir's reputation in the same way Liz Truss was damaged by her mini-budget. The Mail on Sunday has a different warning for the prime minister, saying planned tax rises are putting Britain on the path to destitution.  Its report focuses on statistics put together by a firm which helps wealthy people move overseas.  The data from Henley and Partners suggests a record number of the UK's highest earners, who contribute the biggest tax share to the Treasury, are planning to leave the country in the wake of rumoured levies such as a mansion tax in next month's Budget. The Sunday Telegraph's main story suggests the BBC has breached its own editorial guidelines 1,500 times in coverage of the Gaza war.  It says a report - which used artificial intelligence to analyse BBC News output - revealed a pattern of bias against Israel.  The research was led by a British lawyer based in Jerusalem, Trevor Asserson.  A BBC statement questioned the use of AI in the study and insisted that the corporation was achieving due impartiality. ""Half the world away: Oasis tour to go global"" says the Sunday Mirror.  Its front page says the brit-pop band are in talks to take their 2025 reunion tour overseas, with gigs planned for the US, Mexico and Argentina.  The paper says adding the international dates could take the band's profits to more than £500m. The Sun on Sunday says the former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Amanda Abbington is ""in a rage with the BBC"" ahead of the corporation's report into the dancer, Giovanni Pernice, who has been accused of bullying.  The paper says she has told friends that she expects the BBC to side with Mr Pernice.  The Italian - who is not taking part in the upcoming season of Strictly - has always denied any wrongdoing. And the Sunday Telegraph sports section says England's footballers ""hit the right notes"" in their 2-0 win against the Republic of Ireland - a nod to the new Three Lions boss, Lee Carsley, not singing the national anthem before kick-off.  Saturday's edition of the paper took a dim view of Carsley's decision.  Its chief football correspondent, Jason Burt, accused him of being naive and said he should not be managing the national side if he did not sing God Save the King.  ""Car starts with a bang"" says the Sunday Express headline. Its back page features a picture of a smiling Carsley, as well as England's goal scorers Declan Rice and Jack Grealish.

Their discovery has led to what the Guardian calls ""an eruption of public outrage"" against the Israeli government for the failure to reach a deal to bring the remaining hostages back.  Frustration among relatives has, according to the Financial Times, become more intense because of the realisation that time is running out for the 101 hostages still being held. The Times says protests and the prospect of a general strike are increasing the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The decision to scrap one-word Ofsted judgements for the state sector in England is described by Metro as a ""Grade big U-turn on schools"". The Daily Telegraph reports that the change has been introduced so swiftly the exact form of the new report cards has not been decided. The paper understands they could be ""at a glance"" sheets no bigger than A4. ""Another week, another win for the unions,"" says The Sun - adding, in its editorial, ""teachers have got their way""  ""Germany's far right has first big win since Nazis"", is the Times' lead on the electoral success for the AfD party in regional elections in Thuringia and Saxony. The Guardian says the results have ""sent shockwaves through the political landscape"". But according to the FT, what has happened is a reflection of mounting frustration among many east Germans against a government that they associate with high inflation, economic stagnation, surging energy costs and constant internecine squabbling. The Telegraph reckons Olaf Scholz's days as chancellor are numbered. The Daily Mirror reports that almost 60 children a day were suspended from school for racism last year. In all 11,619 pupils were sent home in 2023 - an increase of 25% on the previous 12 months. Campaigners claim impressionable children are repeating what they hear from their parents and right-wing figures in the media. The Department for Education says racism and discrimination has no place in schools. ""How Ludicrous!"", is the Daily Express' take on a claim by the Commons leader that the government cut universal winter fuel payments for pensioners to prevent a run on the pound. Shadow Treasury Minister Laura Trott has described Lucy Powell's remarks as ""ridiculous fantasies"".  The Sun's political editor, Harry Cole, calls the remarks ""gibberish"". Ms Powell, leader of the House of Commons, said she was ""really sorry"" that the government had been forced to make the decision - but said ministers had been left with no choice.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgj36n8e6ro,Israeli West Bank raid leaves destruction and determination in its wake,Palestinians in Nur Shams camp speak to the BBC's Lucy Williamson after Israeli forces withdraw.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.915104,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Majdi was in his house at the entrance of Nur Shams refugee camp when the Israeli armoured bulldozers came. He told his three children not to be scared as the bulldozer pushed up against their front wall, smashing through the staircase and balcony. ""The bulldozer kept coming closer to the house,"" he said. ""It lifted the rubble near those two windows above. It was trying to hit them."" Residents living near the entrances to Nur Shams often leave when they hear the Israeli army is coming. I asked Majdi why he stayed. ""Why would I leave?"" he said.  ""We won't leave. We are staying here. We either go back to our lands [in what is now Israel] or stay here and die. There are no other options."" At least four men were killed in the Tulkarm area, which includes Nur Shams, during Israel’s two-day military operation here, including at least two who were fighting Israeli forces. ""Every time one of us is killed, 10 more are born. We are crushing them, and hopefully, our children will also crush them,"" Majdi said. Israel's army pulled out of Nur Shams camp on Friday morning, but its wider operation across the north of the occupied West Bank continues - with the aim, Israel says, of dismantling the armed groups there. One of the men killed during the operation was 69-year-old Ayed Abu Hajja, who was disabled and a long-term resident of Nur Shams. He was shot by a sniper, neighbours said, when he opened a window in his house. On Friday, his body was carried through the narrow streets to his mother's home, before burial. A large crowd of young men gathered to escort his body to the cemetery - but others were there to honour someone else. Groups of young men filed silently past the crowd with their weapons - to a separate, symbolic burial for their leader, Mohammed Jaber - also killed during the Israeli operation in this city The fighter and the civilian, living for years side by side in Nur Shams, remembered side by side in death. One with prayers; the other with bursts of automatic gunfire - a show of force from Tulkarm’s armed fighters, less than a day after Israel’s army withdrew. Inside Nur Shams, Israel’s operation has left war-like destruction in parts of the camp: houses burned out, walls sheared off.  Whole buildings collapsed into rubble have opened up new, sloping and precarious routes between the camp's main streets. A child of six or seven, dwarfed by a mountain of concrete boulders, reaches gently in to pick out a bright yellow toy walkie-talkie from the remains of his grandmother’s house. Standing nearby is his grandmother’s next-door neighbour, Fadwa Abu Ayad, her path to the street cut off by the rubble mountain. The army also came to her house, she said. ""They told us that we have tunnels like in Gaza, and smuggle the armed groups to this house,"" Fadwa said. I asked her if that was true. ""It's impossible,"" she replied. ""He brought a drill and dug into the floor. All he found was a sewer hole."" Fadwa takes us through another entrance to her house, and shows us the broken floor - beneath it is a small pipe and what appears to be a sewer drain. It's too small for a person to fit through. ""What is happening in the [West Bank] camps now is like a small version of Gaza,"" Fadwa said. ""Ever since 7 October,"" she added, referring to the day of Hamas's deadly attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. Down another shattered street, paved with broken glass and burned pieces of rubble, I hear a voice at the window above me. It turns out to be Umm Yazan. She says the army laid wires from her home to blow up two of the houses opposite – families she has known for decades. ""I have 10-year-old triplets, and they trapped us in a room,” she told me. ""Then they started the explosions - five explosions in total. Imagine the walls shaking and your young children clinging to you. It feels like we’re in Gaza."" Israel says this is a counter-terrorist operation, to dismantle Palestinian armed groups it says are funded and armed by Iran.  But Umm Yazan replies that it is the army's responsibility to target fighters, and not involve families like hers. ""Are there fighters in my house? I have young children, my husband has an Israeli work permit. My house is a safe house."" You hear comparisons with Gaza a lot here now. The grinding conflict between Israel and armed Palestinian groups in the West Bank is still very different to the Gaza war, but that war has changed attitudes and tactics here - on both sides. It has changed how Israel views the threat from armed groups here - and, some say, it is also changing its response on the ground."

There was fierce fighting inside the camp on Saturday, with battles reportedly taking place in the central Damaj neighbourhood, where armed groups have a strong presence, as well as near the camp entrances. Out of the gunfire, under the constant buzzing of military drones, the figures of several women and children threaded past Israeli army vehicles. Alone on the deserted road, among the military trucks, they looked small and out of place. Oruba Shalabi, scared, distressed, and carrying her two-month-old daughter, told us what they had experienced inside the camp. “They were firing at us and throwing hand-grenades at homes,” she said. “Half our home was blown up. We were hiding in the kitchen and shouting to tell them that we have a baby.” Oruba says she went to the doorstep to tell them that the children in the house were afraid and struggling to breathe from the smoke. “They told us we had two minutes to go out,” she said. “They checked our phones and IDs, made us stand in the sun for half an hour, then told us to walk straight ahead.” Oruba left on foot, just as she was, with her mother, aunt, sister and niece. It’s the first time they have been able to leave their home since Tuesday night. “There was no electricity or water [in the camp],” she said. “They were shooting at anyone coming close to the windows.  All our neighbours were forced out and we were all put in one room. They got the young men to sit on the floor and tied them up.” The fighting in Jenin intensified on Saturday. The Palestinian Red Crescent has said there are at least two bodies inside the camp they have been unable to retrieve.   The Palestinian health ministry has said one of them is an elderly man. There are also unconfirmed reports of Israeli army casualties. A statement from one of the armed groups – al-Aqsa Martyr’s Brigade – claimed its fighters had engaged soldiers in an ambush in Damaj. Israel’s operation this week began with incursions into several cities and refugee camps in the north of the occupied West Bank.  Over the past three days, the focus of that operation has narrowed to Jenin, as troops have pulled out of Tulkarem and Tubas. Early on Friday morning, the Israeli army confronted and killed the man it says headed Hamas in Jenin, Wissam Khazem, along with two other men it said were wanted for shooting attacks. But this operation is still ongoing, with reports that Israeli forces are moving deep inside the camp to search house-to-house for other wanted men. Israel says it has killed 20 armed fighters in the operation and recovered weapons including M16 rifles and explosive devices. The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah says that 20 people have been killed across the West Bank. The head of the UN agency dealing with Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, says children are among them. One of those killed is an 82-year-old man whose body was found with nine bullet wounds on Friday, a paramedic told the BBC. Israel says this is a counter-terrorism operation to dismantle armed Palestinian groups, which it believes are backed by Iran. An attempted bomb attack in Tel Aviv earlier this month has also sparked alarm in Israel that the threat of suicide attacks in Israeli cities will resurface. Overnight, Israel’s army said there were two attempted attacks on settlements in the southern part of the West Bank. Its chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, said the ongoing operation in Jenin was aimed at preventing exactly these kinds of attacks. Tensions over the Gaza War – and repeated military incursions into the West Bank – are changing attitudes and tactics here on both sides. The risk is that they will push the conflict here into a new and more dangerous phase."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvdyd4nnzro,No new pledge on Ukraine missiles after Starmer-Biden talks,Ukraine has repeatedly urged the UK and US to let it fire long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.408775,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has held ""productive"" talks with US President Joe Biden about Ukraine – but he did not signal any decision on allowing Kyiv to fire long-range missiles into Russia. Sir Keir said the talks in Washington concentrated on ""strategy"", rather than a ""particular step or tactic"". The White House said the pair had also expressed ""deep concern about Iran and North Korea's provision of lethal weapons to Russia"". Early on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had launched over 70 Iranian-made drones across Ukraine overnight, and that his country needed more air defence and long-range capabilities ""to protect life and our people"". ""We are working on this with all Ukrainian partners,"" he said. Ahead of the talks at the White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Western nations not to let Ukraine fire long-range missiles at Russia. Putin said such a move would represent Nato's ""direct participation"" in the Ukraine war.  But former UK defence secretary Sir Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Nato should let Ukraine fire long-range missiles in Russia in spite of Putin's threats, adding that wrangling was just benefiting the Russian president. ""I'm just disappointed that it's yet again another tug of war around another capability,"" the former Conservative MP said. Kurt Volker, former US special representative for Ukraine negotiations said Putin's comments were made to prevent further Western action. ""The reason Putin says those things is to achieve the result of deterring us from doing things - not that it has any bearing on what he's really going to do or really thinks,"" he told the Today programme. Commenting on the debate over long-range missiles, he said the US ""overplays the sense that this is a new red line that this would be so provocative to Russia that it would create some kind of new escalation"". Addressing reporters ahead of his meeting with Sir Keir at the White House, Biden said: ""I don't think much about Vladimir Putin.""  To date, the US and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia, for fear of escalation. However, Zelensky has repeatedly called on Kyiv's Western allies to authorise such use, saying it is the only way to bring about an end to the war. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under daily bombardment from Russia.  Many of the missiles and glide bombs that hit Ukraine's military positions, blocks of flats, energy facilities and hospitals are launched by Russian aircraft deep inside Russia. Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself. The UK previously said Ukraine had a ""clear right"" to use British-provided weapons for ""self-defence"" which ""does not preclude operations inside Russia"", following Kyiv's surprise cross-border incursion last month. However, this excludes the use of long-range Storm Shadow missiles in territory outside Ukraine's internationally recognised borders. The US provided long-range missiles to Ukraine earlier this year, but like Kyiv's other Western allies these have not been authorised for use on targets deep inside Russia. Asked if he was intimidated by Putin's threats of a potential war with Nato, Sir Keir said ""the quickest way to resolve"" the war in Ukraine ""lies through what Putin actually does"". Sir Keir said the White House meeting with Biden was an opportunity to discuss the strategy in relation to Ukraine, ""not just a particular step or tactic"".  The pair also discussed the situation in the Middle East, where the Israel-Gaza war has been raging for nearly a year, and ""other areas across the world"", Sir Keir added. He told reporters they would get another opportunity to discuss these issues at the United Nations General Assembly next week.  In a separate briefing on Friday, ahead of the two leaders' meeting, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington was not planning any change in the limits it has placed on Ukraine's use of US-made weapons to hit Russian territory. Earlier on Friday, Moscow expelled six British diplomats, revoking their accreditation and accusing them of spying.  The country's security service, the FSB, said in a statement it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia. The accusations were dismissed by the UK Foreign Office as ""completely baseless"". In an interview with the BBC, UK defence analyst Justin Crump said Putin was testing the new Labour government and the outgoing Biden administration.  ""Ultimately Russia already supplies weapons to the UK's adversaries, and is already engaged in 'active measures' such as subversion, espionage, sabotage, and information/cyber operations against Nato members' interests. ""This may all accelerate, but picking a fight against all of Nato is not something Russia can afford given how hard they're struggling against just Ukraine,"" Mr Crump added.  Also on Friday, the US announced new sanctions against the Russian media channel RT, accusing it of being a ""de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus"". The top US diplomat, Antony Blinken, told reporters RT is part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets, which have sought to covertly ""undermine democracy in the United States"". In response to US allegations that RT had sought to influence elections, the broadcaster's editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan - who was sanctioned by the US last week - said they were excellent teachers, adding that many RT staff had studied in the US, and with US funding. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said there should be a ""new profession"" in the US, of specialist in sanctions imposed on Russia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykjx57kz8o,Israel says Hamas leader killed on third day of West Bank operation,Israeli forces say they killed the head of Hamas in Jenin and two others in an overnight operation.,31 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.504444,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Israeli military says it has killed the head of the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Jenin and two other fighters, as a major operation continues for a third day in the north of the occupied West Bank. Israeli security forces shot dead Wissam Khazem and then carried out air strikes on the other two as they attempted to flee, a statement said. The Palestinian health ministry said the three men were killed overnight near the town of Zababdeh, south-east of Jenin. Hamas also confirmed their deaths. The ministry said an elderly man was later killed by Israeli gunfire in Jenin itself, while Israeli forces pulled out of Tulkarm and its refugee camps. At least 20 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Israeli operation, which is one of the biggest in the West Bank in two decades, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Armed groups have identified most of them as fighters.  The Israeli military has said 20 ""terrorists"" have been killed in exchanges of fire and air strikes and 17 suspects detained during what it has described as ""a precise, targeted regional operation across three terror hubs"". There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. On Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Shin Bet domestic security agency and Israel Border Police put out a joint statement announcing that Wissam Khazem had been killed during an operation in the Jenin area. It said Border Police forces had “encountered and eliminated” Khazem in a car, and accused him of carrying out and directing shooting and bombing attacks. Shortly afterwards, it added, an IDF aircraft had “eliminated two additional terrorists while they attempted to flee from the vehicle”. It named them as Maysara Masharqa and Arafat Amer, and alleged that they had taken part in shooting attacks. The Palestinian health ministry said the three men had been killed in Zababdeh and that their bodies had been taken away by Israeli forces. Residents of the town found the burned-out wreck of a car riddled with bullet holes and reported that there had been two drone strikes. Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed that Khazem was a leader in Jenin camp and that Masharqa and Amer were members. Israeli forces also continued their operation in Jenin itself for a third consecutive day. Palestinian news agency Wafa cited the Palestinian Red Crescent as saying that a man from an eastern neighbourhood of the city had been shot and killed by Israeli forces on Friday night, and that the ambulance transporting his body to a local hospital had later came under fire.  Wafa identified the dead man as Tawfiq Qandil, 82. Meanwhile, residents of Tulkarm and its refugee camps inspected the damage to homes and infrastructure following the withdrawal of Israeli forces.  A woman in Nur Shams camp, Umm Yazan, told the BBC that soldiers had laid wires from her home to blow up two of the houses opposite. ""I have 10-year-old triplets, and they trapped us in a room,” she said. ""Then they started the explosions - five explosions in total. Imagine the walls shaking and your young children clinging to you. It feels like we’re in Gaza."" The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had killed “five terrorists who were hiding in a mosque”, including Mohammed Jaber, the leader of the local Tulkarm Brigade, which is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Wafa said four Palestinians had been killed during the 48-hour operation. Jaber was buried in Nur Shams on Friday along with 69-year-old Ayed Abu Hajja, a disabled man who neighbours said was shot by a sniper when he opened a window of his house in the camp. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military announced that forces had pulled out of the al-Faraa refugee camp near Tubas after completing what it called “the objective of foiling terror, exposing terrorist infrastructure and eliminating armed terrorists”. The head of the Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, said tens of thousands of people in four refugee camps had been affected by the raids, and that the agency had been forced to suspend services in several camps. With the war in Gaza still raging, the Israeli operation is causing international alarm. The UK said on Friday that while it recognised Israel’s need to defend itself against security threats, it was “deeply worried by the methods Israel has employed and by reports of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure"". ""The risk of instability is serious and the need for de-escalation urgent,"" a Foreign Office spokesperson said. The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday that the raids were “fuelling an already explosive situation”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gegkkg14ko,Germany to welcome Kenyans in labour deal,Germany agrees to ease some of its immigration laws to enable Kenyans find employment in the European's biggest economy.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.614569,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Berlin has agreed to allow skilled and semi-skilled Kenyan workers into Germany in a controlled and targeted labour migration deal.  Kenya is struggling with increasing difficulties in providing work and sufficient income for its young professionals, while Germany is facing a shortage of skilled labour.  The German government has said the deal does not specify the number of workers who will be allowed in.  Migration agreements are a central pillar in the German government's efforts to curb immigration.  The agreement will also simplify the repatriation of Kenyans who are in Germany without legal permission. Five Kenyan bus drivers have already been welcomed to Flensburg, in the north of Germany, in a pilot project.  Immigration is a huge issue in Germany at the moment, following the rise in popularity of the far-right anti-immigration party, Alternative for Germany (AfD).  Successive governments in Berlin have allowed relatively large numbers of asylum seekers to settle in the country in recent years. Germany took in more than one million people, mostly fleeing war in countries such as Syria, during the 2015-2016 migrant crisis, and has received 1.2 million Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. The labour deal was signed in Berlin by Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Kenya's President William Ruto.  Germany agreed to ease some of its immigration laws to enable Kenyans to find employment in Europe's biggest economy.  Authorities in Berlin will also consider extending temporary residence permits for Kenyan workers who have secured an approved job. Kenyans will also be issued with long-term visas to study or do vocational training in Germany. ""On the expiry of the long-stay visa, Kenyans may receive a temporary residence permit for study purposes in Germany for up to two years,"" the agreement states.  The temporary residence permit may be extended if the purpose of residence has not yet been achieved but is achievable within a ""reasonable"" period, it adds.  According to the deal, IT specialists from Kenya will be allowed to enter and work in Germany, even if they do not have formal qualifications. Both governments will support the immigration of skilled workers who have finished vocational training or earned a university degree, as long as their qualifications are recognised by the relevant authorities of the other party.  The deal also includes provisions for the readmission and return of citizens between the two nations. It spells out guidelines to prevent and fight against labour exploitation, forced labour and human trafficking.  While welcoming five Kenyan drivers in Flensburg on Thursday, Schleswig-Holstein's Transport Minister Claus Ruhe Madsen said Germany was in need of  hard-working hands and clever minds.  ""We simply have to position ourselves in Germany in such a way that it is attractive to come here,"" Mr Madsen added.  The drivers are the first batch of Kenyan workers, who will be trained by the Aktiv bus company in a pilot project, hoping to get a job in Germany. Doctors, nurses and teachers are among those expected to take part in the programme. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) said the deal was expected to significantly increase access to decent foreign jobs for Kenyan workers in Germany and address labour shortages in Germany. ""It includes mechanisms to protect the rights and welfare of Kenyan migrant workers in Germany, ensuring safe, orderly, and productive migration,"" ILO added in a statement.  But there are concerns about a brain-drain in Kenya with professionals like doctors and nurses going abroad for jobs, leaving local hospitals with a huge shortage of medical workers.  ""It is sad that we are going to service other countries at the expense of our own country,"" Ekuru Aukot, a Kenyan lawyer and politician, told the BBC's Newsday programme.  But Roseline Njogu, a senior foreign affairs official, said Kenya was simply responding to the global labour market demands.   ""We have a youth bulge in Kenya and  every year we have a million people joining the local labour market. It takes time and resources to create job opportunities at home,"" she added.  Correction 14 September 2024:  An earlier version of this article put a figure on how many Kenyan workers would be allowed into Germany under the deal. The German interior ministry corrected this to state that the deal did not specify a figure.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmw8rrrdw4o,Aid group says Israeli strike on Gaza convoy kills four Palestinians,"Israel's military says it hit ""armed assailants"" who took control of an Anera convoy's lead vehicle.",31 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.712068,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Four Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on an aid convoy in southern Gaza on Thursday, the US-based aid group Anera says. A statement said the ""community members"" were in the lead vehicle of a convoy which was carrying food and fuel to the Emirates Red Crescent hospital in Rafah from the Kerem Shalom border crossing and whose movements were co-ordinated with the Israeli military. The military said it targeted ""a number of armed assailants"" who seized control of the lead vehicle. Anera said none of its staff were harmed in the strike and that the remainder of the convoy successfully delivered the aid. In a statement published on Friday, Anera said the transport plan for the aid convoy to Rafah had been co-ordinated and cleared with Israeli authorities and that its agreement with transit company Move One had called for unarmed security guards. ""Shortly after departing Kerem Shalom, initial reports indicate that four community members with experience in previous missions and engagement in community security with Move One came forward in a car and requested to take the place of the leading vehicle, citing concern that the route was unsafe and at risk of being looted,"" it said. ""The four community members were neither vetted nor co-ordinated in advance, and Israeli authorities allege that the lead car was carrying numerous weapons,"" it added. ""However, the four individuals were not perceived by the convoy as a hostile threat."" One of Anera's employees ""witnessed the incident at close range"" from the second vehicle in the convoy but was not harmed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement, which did not give a death toll, that “during the convoy’s movement, a number of armed assailants seized control of the vehicle in the front of the convoy... and began to lead it”. “After the takeover and further verification that a precise strike on the armed assailants’ vehicle could be carried out, a strike was conducted,"" it added. ""No damage was caused to the other vehicles in the convoy and it reached its destination.""  Anera said the Israeli strike was carried out without prior warning or communication. “According to all the information we have, this is a case of partners on the ground endeavouring to deliver aid successfully,” says Anera President and CEO Sean Carroll. “This should not come at the cost of people’s lives.” The aid group is conducting a review of the incident. It came a day after the UN World Food Programme said it had paused the movement of its staff in the Gaza Strip ""until further notice"", after its team came under fire near an Israeli checkpoint in northern Gaza on Tuesday. A US diplomat said on Thursday that Israel had told Washington that the incident was ""a result of a communication error between IDF units"". ""We have urged them to immediately rectify the issues within their system that allowed this to happen,"" Robert Wood, the deputy US envoy to the UN, told a UN Security Council meeting. The IDF promised to improve deconfliction for aid convoys after admitting that ""grave mistakes"" had led to an air strike in April that killed seven World Central Kitchen workers.. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Nabil Arif, 36, from Birmingham, sent correspondence to the Birmingham Yardley Labour MP between 13 October and 20 February. Ms Phillips said the abuse changed her life immeasurably as she feared physical harm from him. Arif was convicted of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. His last email to the MP on 20 February described her as ""pathetic"" and threatened that she would ""burn until her skin is no more"" which prompted her to report the offence to the police the next day, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. They added Arif, from Warwick Road, was sentenced to 12 weeks in custody on Monday following a trial at the same court on 29 July. He was also made the subject of a restraining order barring him from contacting the MP until further notice. In her victim impact statement, Ms Phillips expressed fear that Arif’s aggression towards her might escalate and potentially lead to her coming to physical harm at his hands, the CPS said. The abuse “limited my freedom and my ability to do my job closely with the public as I used to do"", she said. Richard Purchase of the CPS said: “Members of Parliament have a right to perform their duties and represent their constituents without being subjected to derogatory messages that cause alarm and distress.  ""It is clear that Nabil Arif’s behaviour escalated from the initial emails, leading Ms Phillips to fear for her safety."" Ms Phillips has previously spoken about a rise in the amount of personal abuse she has been subjected to as an MP. In November she quit the Labour party front bench over a ceasefire vote on Gaza.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4xl4pvn0yo,UN calls for de-escalation as Israeli West Bank raids continue,"The IDF confirms 16 people have been killed as it carries out ""counter-terrorism"" operations.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.891477,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israeli forces have carried out raids in the occupied West Bank for a second day running, leading to calls for de-escalation from the United Nations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday it was beginning a ""counter-terrorism operation"". On Thursday, it said 12 people had been killed in the cities of Jenin and Tulkarm and four in Far'a.  The Palestinian health ministry also reported 16 people had been killed since Wednesday morning.   UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called on Israel to immediately halt its operation, saying it was ""fuelling an already explosive situation"". He urged Israeli forces to ""exercise maximum restraint and use lethal force only when it is strictly unavoidable"". The IDF said five were killed after ""exchanges of fire"" in Tulkarm with militants who had ""hidden inside a mosque"". It said seven people had died in Jenin. Mohammed Jaber, who is also known as Abu Shujaa, was among those killed, according to the Israeli military. He was reportedly the local leader of the Tulkarem Brigade, which is backed by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group. The IDF said Jaber was linked to a number of attacks on Israelis, and was planning more. The Tulkarm Brigade said in a statement on Telegram that its fighters ambushed an Israeli infantry unit ""in response to the assassination of our commander"", without naming him.  The IDF said it had apprehended 10 wanted suspects, and recovered explosives and weapons during raids in Tulkarm and Jenin. In Far'a, the IDF said it killed four armed militants inside a vehicle.  The Palestinian Mission to the UN condemned the raids in a letter on Thursday, saying the Israeli military had ""invaded homes, deliberately targeted civilians, destroyed vital infrastructure and even besieged the four main hospitals in the area"".  In response to the criticism, the IDF referred the BBC to its earlier statements that said it targeted armed militants, with some linked to previous attacks.  In Jenin, ambulances were being stopped and checked by military jeeps parked around the government hospital as security forces continued their operation in the city's refugee camp. The camp is a base for armed groups, as well as a home to unarmed civilians, and has been the scene of many fierce gun battles in the past. Israeli forces have blocked access to the camp and Palestinian phone networks have been disrupted.  It is the second day of what Israeli media say could be a days-long operation in the West Bank. It is one of the largest such actions in the West Bank since the days of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, two decades ago. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said the operation has a ""clear goal: preventing Iranian terror-by-proxy that would harm Israeli civilians"". In recent days, Israeli politicians have accused Iran - which backs both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - of trying to smuggle in explosive devices with the aim of attacking Israel. Israel ""cannot sit idly by and wait for the spectacle of buses and cafes exploding in city centres"", Mr Danon said in a post on X. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, and the subsequent war in Gaza. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Israel's operation in the West Bank ""must not constitute the premises of a war extension from Gaza"". He said he was starting the process of asking EU members if they want to impose sanctions on ""some Israeli ministers"". He accused the ministers - who he has not named - of ""launching unacceptable hate messages against the Palestinians, and proposing things that clearly go against international law""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl62rvvp8o,"Gaza polio vaccine rollout starts well, UN says",The drive comes after the first confirmed case of the disease in 25 years was discovered in Gaza.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.975835,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The first full day of a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children against polio in Gaza has been successful, the UN says. The rollout relies on a series of localised pauses in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters, and the first three-day window began on Sunday. ""So far, it's going well and the turnaround is really good,” Salim Oweis, a spokesman for the UN children’s fund Unicef, told the BBC. To be effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) says at least 90% of children under 10 must be immunised in a short time frame. The drive follows the first confirmed case of polio in 25 years in Gaza. On Thursday, the WHO announced an agreement with Israel for limited pauses in the fighting to allow the polio vaccination programme to take place. Around 1.3 million doses of the vaccine were recently brought in through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint by Unicef. The agency has had to keep them in cold storage in its warehouse at the correct temperature to maintain their potency. Another shipment of 400,000 doses is set to be delivered to Gaza soon. On Sunday, Palestinians were able to take their children to three health centres in central Gaza in the first phase of the campaign, which will later extend to the north and the south. Nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated at the Deir el-Balah clinic alone, said UN spokeswoman Louise Wateridge. Among the parents who rushed their children to receive doses was Ghadir Hajji, a mother of five. ""They absolutely have to be vaccinated,"" she told AFP news agency as the family waited in line.  ""We received text messages from the ministry of health and we showed up right away."" Each “humanitarian pause” is set to last from 06:00 until 15:00 local time over three days, with the possibility of adding an extra day if needed. Unicef's Jonathan Crickx says it is crucial that these temporary truces hold. “You cannot lead and implement a polio vaccination campaign in an active combat zone. It’s simply impossible,” he says.  “Families need to be feeling safe in bringing their children to get the vaccines. But also, the healthcare workers need to be able to safely reach the communities.” “This is a huge endeavour,” Mr Crickx adds. “Especially in a place like the Gaza Strip where we know that, for example, roads have been damaged, that access is problematic, that security incidents take place on a daily basis.” One doctor involved in the operation, Dr Mohammed Salha, told the BBC that one of the main challenges facing the drive was the lack of fuel needed to keep hospitals running and for the cold chain storage of the vaccines.  He said he also worried people would be “scared to move from shelters to hospitals or healthcare centres” even with the agreement of a humanitarian pause in place. About 90% of all Gazans have been displaced and with health services under huge strain, most children have seen their regular immunisations disrupted leaving them vulnerable to infection, like baby Abdulrahman Abu Judyan. A video shot a few months ago shows that he was crawling early.  But now as he turns one, his mother Niveen - who lives in a crowded tent camp in central Gaza - worries that he will never be able to walk. “It was very shocking,” Niveen tells the BBC, recalling her son’s recent diagnosis with polio, which has left him partly paralysed in one leg.  “I wasn’t expecting this.  Now he may not be able to crawl or walk and the child was left without proper medical care.” On 7 October - the day of a shocking Hamas-led attack on southern Israel which killed 1,200 people - newborn Abdulrahman was supposed to receive routine vaccinations but never did. During the war that followed, the Abu Judyan family from the very north of Gaza, have moved five times - first to Gaza City, then to different locations in the centre, to Rafah in the far south and back to Deir al-Balah. “I feel a lot of guilt that he didn’t get the vaccination. But I couldn’t give it to him because of our circumstances,” Niveen says as she rocks her baby in a car seat.  She desperately hopes that her son can be taken outside Gaza for treatment.  “He wants to live and walk like other children,” she says. The mother struggles to find clean drinking water for her nine children.  Close to the makeshift tent where they live, raw sewage flows through the street. Conditions are ideal for the spread of diseases - especially polio which is highly infectious. Since discovering the virus in wastewater samples taken in June, UN agencies have been racing to set up an emergency mass vaccination programme. More than 2,000 workers - mostly locals - are involved in the immunisation effort.  Palestinian health officials say there will be more than 400 fixed vaccination sites - which include healthcare centres, hospitals, clinics, and field hospitals – and about 230 so-called outreach sites, community gathering places, where vaccines will be distributed. Each child must receive two drops of oral polio vaccine in two rounds, the second to be administered four weeks after the first.  It is essential that the programme is carried out quickly to prevent mutation of the virus and break transmission. The polio variant that triggered this latest outbreak is itself a mutated virus from an oral polio vaccine. This is because the vaccine contains a weakened live virus which in very rare cases is shed by those who receive it and can then evolve into a new form that can start new epidemics. With doctors in Gaza on high alert for potential polio infections in children, tests are being carried out at a WHO-approved laboratory in Jordan. “There could be more cases of paralytic polio until this outbreak is stopped and this virus will paralyse more children,” Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO director of polio eradication for the eastern Mediterranean, tells me from Amman. He says the stakes are high for the whole region.  “The risk of course, is not only just for Gaza, given the high force of transmission in Gaza, there is a risk of this spilling over into Israel, into the West Bank and surrounding countries.” For now, though the focus remains on Gaza - where children make up nearly half of the 2.3 million population. The past year has deprived many of their loved ones, their homes and health. With no end in sight to the war, the hope is that at least one new source of suffering can be eliminated."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly35g91712o,Dozens arrested after clashes at Melbourne anti-war protest,"Police said officers were targeted by demonstrators throwing rocks, manure and bottles containing acid.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.292208,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Dozens of people have been arrested after clashing with police at an anti-war demonstration in Melbourne.  Police said they were ""appalled"" by the actions of some demonstrators targeting a military hardware sales show in Australia's most populous city, accusing them of pelting officers with rocks, manure and bottles filled with acid. By contrast, protestors said officers were heavy-handed and responded with flashbang grenades and irritant sprays to control the hostile crowd.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the violence, saying Australians had a right to protest - but had to do so in a peaceful manner.  ""You don't say you're opposed to defence equipment by throwing things at police,"" Mr Albanese told local media. ""They've got a job to do and our police officers should be respected at all times.""  Authorities said about 1,200 people had taken part in the demonstration targeting the Land Forces International Land Defence Exposition, many of whom sported Palestinian flags and sang pro-Palestinian chants.  Police had anticipated unrest ahead of the event, which is expected to draw over 1,000 corporations from 31 countries in the coming days. The expo, which is not open to the public, brings together military, defence, government, scientific and industry delegations from around the world.  Local media reported military artillery, trucks and semi-automatic weapons have been on display during the convention. Activists had said they were protesting as they claim many of the weapons on-show have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza.  Footage showed dumpsters being pushed towards police lines during the clashes, with multiple fires being lit across the city and demonstrators blocking roads. One activist climbed on top of a stationary truck at a set of traffic lights.  About two dozen police officers were treated for injuries sustained during the unrest, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said. He told reporters 39 people had been arrested in Wednesday's clashes.  Commissioner Patton accused those behind the violence of being ""hypocrites"", adding demonstrators said they wanted to ""protest against war, so presumably [were] anti-violence"".  But his officers have been criticised by demonstrators for being overly heavy-handed. Organisers said they were ""appalled at the level of violence directed against community members protesting for peace"". ""The police have been extremely violent towards protestors today, actually in an unprecedented way,"" Jasmine Duff, an activist from Students for Palestine, said.  ""They used flashbang grenades, they’ve been pepper spraying people very viciously."" Some journalists reported seeing police fire rubber bullets, but Commissioner Patton said the projectiles were actually hard foam baton rounds.  Officials say around A$10m (£7.6m) was spent on deploying extra police to protect the event, with officers reportedly drafted in from New South Wales.  ""It's absolutely outrageous that reportedly $10 million has been spent on this police presence,"" one of the protest group organisers, Anneke Demanuele from Students for Palestine, told ABC News.  Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan defended the state's handling of the event, saying delegates had the right to gather in Melbourne.  ""Any industry deserves the right to have these sort of events in a peaceful and respectful way,"" she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02z5kjn40o,Israel agrees to pauses in fighting for polio vaccine drive,"It will be rolled out in three separate stages across the central, southern and northern parts of the strip.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.386970,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has agreed to a series of “humanitarian pauses” in Gaza to allow for the vaccination of children against polio, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. The campaign will aim to vaccinate around 640,000 children across the Gaza strip and will begin on Sunday, senior WHO official Rik Peeperkorn said. It will be rolled out in three separate stages, across the central, southern and northern parts of the strip. During each stage, fighting will pause for three consecutive days between 06:00 and 15:00 local time. The agreement comes days after UN officials said a 10-month-old baby had been partially paralysed after contracting Gaza’s first case of polio for 25 years. Around 1.26m doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) are already in Gaza, with 400,000 additional doses set to arrive soon. The vaccinations will be carried out by UN staff and other local health workers. Over 2,000 health and community outreach personnel have been trained to administer the vaccine. Louise Wateridge, a UN spokeswoman in Gaza, has called for a ceasefire to allow the vaccination programme to run safely. ""We cannot vaccinate children under a sky full of bombs and strikes, we cannot vaccinate children who are fleeing for their lives,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. ""Any military operations during the time we are trying to roll out a vaccination campaign will affect our ability to deliver these vaccinations to children,"" she explained. Ms Wateridge said children will receive two oral doses this week, and will need a repeat vaccination four weeks later. The WHO is aiming to achieve 90% vaccine coverage across the strip, which is needed to stop transmission of the virus within Gaza.  An agreement is in place for an additional fourth day of vaccination and humanitarian pause if needed to achieve that level of vaccination.  Poliovirus is highly infectious and is most often spread through sewage and contaminated water.  It can cause disfigurement and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. Polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% in 2022, although it had declined to 89% last year, according to the latest data. The Israeli military said in July it had begun vaccinating its soldiers against the disease. Hamas official Basem Naim told the Reuters news agency: ""We are ready to cooperate with international organisations to secure this campaign, serving and protecting more than 650,000 Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the series of three-day pauses were ""not a ceasefire"".  James Kariuki, UK deputy permanent representative to the UN, said he ""strongly"" welcomed the vaccination plan.  ""We now need to see this in action and these pauses need to be long enough to deliver the 90% coverage required. When the campaign starts and thousands of vulnerable and unaccompanied children gather at vaccination sites, they must all be protected,"" he added.  Prof Hagai Levine, a spokesman for the Hostages Families Forum - a group which is calling for more action to secure the release of Israeli hostages - urged health workers to ensure those still being held are included in the vaccination campaign.  Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,530 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw398njqj4o,Israel and Hezbollah say they don't want war - but they are both ready for it,"This appears to be Hezbollah’s first significant retaliation for the assassination of a senior commander, Jon Donnison writes.",25 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.486198,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"This morning's exchange of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be a significant escalation. The Israeli military says around 100 fighter jets carried out what it described as pre-emptive strikes on Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon on Sunday morning. Hezbollah later fired rockets and missiles into northern Israel. If that 100 figure is correct, it would be the largest Israeli attack on Lebanon since the full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Israel's strikes happened at around 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT), and it said that Hezbollah was planning a large-scale attack half an hour later, at 05:00 local time. According to reporting by the New York Times, quoting an anonymous Israeli intelligence official, this included rocket strikes on Tel Aviv, the country’s biggest city, deep inside central Israel. In the end Hezbollah said it had fired more than 300 rockets and missiles targeting military facilities in northern Israel, where air raid sirens have been sounding. Across the region, the fear is this latest escalation could once again lead to all-out war. In a statement, Hezbollah said this was the first phase of its response to the Israeli assassination of a senior commander Fouad Shukr in a strike in Beirut on 30 July. It is widely believed Israel was behind the assassination of the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in a strike in the Iranian capital Tehran the following day. Ever since, the region has been waiting for a response from both Hezbollah and Iran. From Iran, it is yet to come. But this appears to be Hezbollah’s first significant retaliation. For weeks now diplomats have been working to try to avoid the crisis in Gaza escalating into a wider regional conflict. The United States has warned the ongoing failure to agree a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas could see those diplomatic efforts fail. But despite intense US pressure, talks to establish a ceasefire deal for Gaza after more than 10 months of war have led to nothing. Israel’s military says it is ready to fight a war on two fronts: in Gaza and on its northern border with Lebanon. But Hezbollah is a far more formidable force than Hamas. It’s estimated it has around 150,000 rockets, some capable of reaching targets across Israel. Its fighters, some of whom have fought in the war in Syria, are well trained and better equipped than those of Hamas. Almost a year into the conflict in Gaza, some question whether there is appetite in Israel for another war. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli army reservists have been called up to fight in Gaza, often serving several tours. But many Israelis, especially those from the north, say Hezbollah needs to be dealt with. Tens of thousands of people living there have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the war in Gaza. Many have lost their businesses. In southern Lebanon too, tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes because of fears of Israeli strikes. Hezbollah, for now, has said it has concluded the first phase of its retaliation for the killing of Fouad Shukr.  Its strikes on Israel this morning appear to have caused relatively little damage and there have been few casualties on either side. Israel believes it successfully thwarted a major Hezbollah attack.  The question becomes: will we now see a return to the more routine cross-border ""tit for tat"" that has been going on since the start of the war in Gaza last October? Or could today's violence escalate into something far more dangerous? Israeli and Hezbollah leaders say they do not want another full-scale war. But both sides say they are ready for it."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w7zlj0n2xo,Rescued Israeli pleads for hostage deal with Hamas,"Kaid Farhan Elkadi was freed in a ""complex operation"" in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military says.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.585906,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A Bedouin Arab man rescued in Gaza has urged Israel to reach a deal with Hamas to free all the remaining hostages, as details of his suffering in captivity have emerged. Kaid Farhan Elkadi, 52, was rescued on Tuesday in a ""complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip"", the Israeli military said. After returning to his village in southern Israel on Wednesday, Mr Elkadi said his ""happiness is not complete as long as there are detainees"".  Meanwhile, a former Israeli mayor said Mr Elkadi had been hardly exposed to sunlight for eight months. In a separate development on Wednesday, Israel announced that it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier killed in last October's attack by Hamas on Israel. The soldier's name was not publicly released at the request of his family. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said ""a bold operation"" by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the country's security service reflected ""our commitment to bringing all the hostages home"".  US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 103 hostages still being held, including at least 33 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.  Mr Elkadi was kidnapped by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel, and is the eighth hostage rescued by Israeli forces since the start of the war in Gaza. On Wednesday, he returned to his home village of Karkur in the Negev desert after being discharged from hospital.  Surrounded by reporters and members of his Bedouin community, Mr Elkadi pleaded for all the hostages to be released.  “It does not matter if they are Arab or Jewish, all have a family waiting for them. They also want to feel the joy. ""I hope, I pray for an end to this,"" he said, revealing that he had the same message during Tuesday's phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""I told Bibi Netanyahu yesterday, ‘Work to bring an end to this.'” Mr Elkadi was allowed to go home after undergoing hospital examinations.  The  father of 11 earlier told his relatives ""about difficult days, a very cruel captivity"", Ata Abu Medigam, ex-mayor of the southern Israeli town of Rahat, told Israel's Haaretz newspaper. ""He spoke about one of the hostages who was held captive with him for two months and died next to him,"" Mr Medigam said. Mr Elkadi had also started worrying about losing his eyesight, Mr Medigam added. ""He would check his eyes to see if they were still working and functioning - he would put his fingers on his eyes to check his reflexes."" Mr Elkadi also told his relatives that one of his fellow detainees had died next to him during his time in captivity, Mr Medigam said. The Israeli military said forces had found Mr Elkadi in an underground tunnel ""when he was alone"". In a statement, the military said no further details about the rescue could be published ""due to considerations of the safety of our hostages, the security of our forces, and national security"". But some details have been emerging about Mr Elkadi's time in captivity.  His cousin, Fadi Abu Sahiban, said Mr Elkadi did not get preferential treatment due to being a Muslim.  ""They didn't give him concessions because he's a Muslim. He says they let him pray, that's the only thing they allowed him to do,"" he told Haaretz. Mr Elkadi had no way of communicating with the outside world and was in constant fear of bombs overhead, his cousin said. He ""would hear the shelling of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] endlessly, he said his body was shaking"", said Mr Abu Sahiban. ""Every day he was sure was his last day, and not only because of his captors, but also because of the shelling of the army. He said that every day is a life-threatening situation."" Mr Elkadi, a grandfather of one, worked for many years as a security guard at Kibbutz Magen, close to the Israel-Gaza border, where he was abducted. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,530 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Indirect talks to broker a ceasefire and the release of hostages have continued in Cairo in recent days, but so far there has been no sign of a breakthrough over key sticking points. They include Mr Netanyahu’s demand that Israel keep troops along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected. Two other Bedouin Arabs - Yousef Zyadna and his son, Hamza - are among the remaining hostages who are still alive, while the body of a third, Mhamad el-Atrash, is still being held by Hamas. Another Bedouin, Hisham al-Sayed, has been held captive in Gaza since 2015."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ejky0dy47o,How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?,Experts suggest that the number of people with ADHD is actually going to remain steady.,15 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.685554,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The number of people taking ADHD medication is at a record high – and the NHS is feeling the strain as it tries to diagnose and treat the condition. Since 2015, the number of patients in England prescribed drugs to treat ADHD has nearly trebled, and BBC research suggests that it would take eight years to assess all the adults on waiting lists. Last year, ADHD was the second-most viewed condition on the NHS website. Concern about this rising demand has prompted the NHS in England to set up a taskforce. So what’s going on and where will it end? Is ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) becoming more common? Are we just getting better at recognising it? Or is it being over-diagnosed? It turns out it’s not just you and I who have been taken by surprise – so have the experts. Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, the ADHD champion for the UK’s Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: “Nobody predicted that the demand would go up so massively over the last 15 years, and especially the last three years.” He’s been running adult ADHD clinics since 2007. At the time, he says, there were just a few of them. ADHD is a fairly novel condition – it’s only 16 years since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) officially recognised it in adults. When considering whether it might keep increasing, Dr Müller-Sedgwick argues that there are two different concepts to consider: prevalence and incidence. Prevalence is the percentage of people who have ADHD – Dr Müller-Sedgwick predicts that will stay pretty steady at 3 to 4% of adults in the UK. Incidence is the number of new cases – people getting a diagnosis. That’s where we’re seeing an increase. He explains: “What has changed is the number of patients we are diagnosing. It’s almost like the more we diagnose, the more word spreads.” Prof Emily Simonoff echoes this. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the King’s Maudsley Partnership for Children and Young People. She thinks about 5 to 7% of children have ADHD in the UK – and says: “It's pretty similar across the world, that’s been consistent and it hasn’t actually risen.” Prof Simonoff agrees that there’s been a “steep incline” in people coming forward for assessment since the pandemic – but says this comes after years of “long-term under-recognition"". She points to statistics on ADHD drugs. She would expect about 3 to 4% of children in the UK to need ADHD medication, but in reality, only 1 to 2% are actually using it. She thinks this shows that we are still underestimating the scale of the issue. Prof Simonoff explains: “I think that's an important starting point for when we say, ‘My goodness, why are we seeing all these children now – are we over-identifying ADHD?’ We have under-diagnosed or under-recognised ADHD in the UK for many, many years.” In other words, we can expect more people to be diagnosed with ADHD now because services are playing catch-up. Thea Stein is chief executive of health think tank the Nuffield Trust. She’s got her own description for the recent increase in demand: “the Hump”. She says: “Diagnosis or desire to be diagnosed has risen because of knowledge and visibility – [it’s as] simple as that.” According to Stein, the most immediate task is getting through the Hump, assessing the huge backlog of people on ADHD waiting lists. Then, in the longer-term, she thinks society will get better at spotting ADHD sooner in children. She hopes this will mean that they get better support from an early age, and take some of the pressure off adult services. She says: “I have real optimism that we will come through this period of time to a much better place as a society. What I don't have optimism about is that this is a quick fix.” ADHD might be a new concept, but people struggling to concentrate is an old problem. In 1798, Scottish doctor Sir Alexander Crichton wrote about a “disease of attention” with “an unnatural degree of mental restlessness.” He explained: “When people are affected in this manner… they say they have the fidgets.” ADHD goes beyond problems concentrating or being hyperactive, though. People with it can struggle regulating their emotions and impulses. It’s been linked to substance abuse and financial difficulties as well as higher rates of crime and even car crashes. All the experts I speak to firmly agree on one point: it is much better for someone with ADHD to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Dr Müller-Sedgwick says there’s a “risk of really bad outcomes”. But he lights up when he describes how diagnosis and treatment can transform lives. He says: “I have seen so many patients getting better, getting back into work or back into education. I have seen parents who were going through family court proceedings who were able to be better parents. “That's why we work in this field, it's a really rewarding part of mental health to work in.” Currently, ADHD treatment revolves around medication and therapy, but there are other options on the horizon. A patch worn by children with ADHD on their foreheads during sleep – connected to a device that sends stimulating pulses into the brain – is on sale in the United States. It’s not prescribed in the UK, but academics here and in the US are working on clinical trials looking into it. Prof Katya Rubia is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King’s College London – as she puts it, “My work over the last 30 years or so is basically imaging ADHD, understanding what is different in the brains [of people with ADHD].” She explains that certain parts of ADHD brains, including the frontal lobe, are slightly smaller and also less active. Prof Rubia is trying to kickstart those areas of the brain, and is working on a study looking at the trigeminal nerve – it goes directly to the brain stem and can increase activity in the frontal lobe. She says: “This is all very new. If we find an effect, we have a new treatment.” While that is yet to be proven, she does add: “If everything goes well, it could be on the market in two years.” So, the hope is that, in the not-too-distant future, there will be more ways to treat ADHD without medication. In the meantime, though, the challenge is getting through that “hump” of people waiting to be assessed – with the belief that, over time, the increase in diagnoses should lessen.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nyy8y48qo,Blogger who documented life in Gaza killed in alleged Israeli strike,"The 20-year-old blogger was killed after being hit by shrapnel from a blast on Monday, the BBC has been told.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.785574,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A blogger who attracted a following on Instagram and TikTok by documenting daily life in Gaza has been killed in a strike. Mohammad 'Medo' Halimy, 20, was hit by shrapnel from a nearby blast caused by an Israeli missile in Khan Younis on Monday, according to two youth organisations he had previously worked with. The Tamer Institute for Community Education told the BBC that Halimy was in an area near the beach where displaced people have sheltered when he was fatally struck. The IDF told the BBC it could not confirm a strike took place in Khan Younis on Monday, but said it was continuing to ""counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians"" in Gaza. Halimy built up a social media audience after his family were forced to flee their home when Israel began its military operation in Gaza in the wake of the 7 October attacks. More than 250,000 people followed him on Instagram and TikTok after he began posting videos detailing his life as one of Gaza's displaced citizens in Rafah and Khan Younis. Halimy's videos ranged from simple cooking recipes he had created with limited supplies and appliances, to walkthrough videos of how he made his content. In an interview last year, he said every clip he posted to social media cost him about $3 - a large sum in Gaza. He posted his final video on Monday, hours before he was killed, in which he showed the tent he was living in and detailed what he had done that day. Both Palestinian organisations which confirmed his death to the BBC said the fatal strike happened in a nearby street and Halimy was injured by flying debris. He died the following day. Spark, a Gaza-based charity with which Halimy had worked in the summer of 2023, confirmed his death to the BBC and praised his ""ability to add beauty and splendour to a place wherever it is” in a post online. ""Muhammad, your kind spirit will remain with us, and we believe you deserve a better world,"" it added. ""May God have mercy on you, my beloved,"" his sister Rahaf wrote in a post on Instagram announcing his death. ""May God accept you as a martyr."" Earlier this year, Halimy told NBC News he hoped his content would help ""to show the world what our life really looks like"". “I’m showing that us Palestinians are very resilient,” he told the US broadcaster.  ""We're going to survive and live no matter what happens, in whatever circumstances. We can't be defeated. We're very strong people, and we're going to live no matter what.” Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,530 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish civilian and combatant deaths. The UN human rights office says most of those killed were women and children. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 104 hostages still being held, including 34 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Indirect talks have continued in Cairo in recent days, but so far there has been no sign of a breakthrough over key sticking points. They include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s demand that Israel keep troops along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas and Egypt have rejected. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywnxj4dd8o,World Food Programme halts Gaza staff movements,The move comes after a convoy of the UN food agency's vehicles was shot at near an Israeli checkpoint.,29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:25.971338,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UN food agency has said it is pausing the movement of its staff in the Gaza Strip ""until further notice"" after its team came under fire near an Israeli checkpoint. In a statement, the World Food Programme (WFP) said the incident happened at the Wadi Gaza bridge on Tuesday evening as two of its armoured vehicles were escorting a convoy of lorries with humanitarian aid. The WFP said that while nobody was injured, one vehicle was directly hit, despite the convoy being clearly marked and ""receiving multiple clearances by Israel"". The BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the issue.  In Wednesday's statement, the WFP said: ""The team was returning from a mission to Kerem Shalom/Karam Abu Salem with two WFP armoured vehicles after escorting a convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian cargo routed to Gaza’s central area. It said one of the WFP vehicles was then ""directly struck by gunfire as it was moving towards"" an IDF checkpoint.   ""It sustained at least 10 bullets: five on the driver’s side, two on the passenger side and three on other parts of the vehicle. None of the employees on board were physically harmed."" The WFP added that although this was not the first security incident during the war, it was the first time its vehicle had been directly shot at near a checkpoint, despite securing the necessary clearances. ""The incident is a stark reminder of the rapidly and ever shrinking humanitarian space in the Gaza Strip, where increasing violence compromises our ability to deliver life-saving assistance,"" the agency said. Executive director Cindy McCain described the incident as ""totally unacceptable"".  ""I call on the Israeli authorities and all parties to the conflict to act immediately to ensure the safety and security of all aid workers in Gaza,"" she added. Earlier, the UN said its humanitarian aid operation in the Gaza Strip was continuing, after a senior official said it had ground to a halt on Monday due to Israeli military evacuation orders. Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Tuesday evening that conditions “made it extremely, extremely difficult for us to do our work”, but that “we are doing what we can with what we have”. On Sunday, UN staff had to relocate quickly after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order covering a part of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone around the central town of Deir al-Balah, where the UN had its main operations centre. The military said it had acted to protect civilians while operating against Hamas “terror operatives” in the area. It also said that it was working with the UN and other international organisations to find alternative locations for them to continue their activities. Up to 88.5% of Gaza has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the UN, which is the primary provider and distributor of humanitarian aid in the territory. That has forced an estimated 1.8 million people to shelter inside the humanitarian zone, which currently spans only about 41 sq km (15.8 sq miles) and lacks critical infrastructure and basic services. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Tuesday evening, Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security Gilles Michaud said the IDF had given more than 200 UN personnel a few hours’ notice on Sunday to move out of their offices and living places in a southern area of Deir al-Balah. The UN’s humanitarian office said the order affected 15 UN and NGO premises, as well as four UN warehouses, a water desalination plant and al-Aqsa hospital, the town’s main medical facility. “The timing could hardly be worse, with the start of a massive polio vaccination campaign scheduled for next week, for which large numbers of staff will need to enter the strip,” Mr Michaud said. The UN is planning to vaccinate 640,000 children after a 10-month-old baby who contracted the water-borne disease was left partially paralysed - the first registered case in Gaza in 25 years. It has appealed to the warring parties to implement two seven-day humanitarian pauses in order to allow the vaccinations to be carried out successfully. The IDF said in a statement on Wednesday that it had been forced to issue evacuation orders in and around Deir al-Balah to carry out “essential operations” against Hamas “terror operatives” and their infrastructure. It also stressed that it was operating “in full co-ordination with the international community to preserve the activity of the international community’s vital centres, including shelters, aid depots and residences”. “However, in light of the cynical exploitation carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organisations, there is sometimes a need to evacuate these centres.” The IDF said it would take action to help find alternative locations for UN agencies and NGOs to continue their activities and to provide alternative aid routes. Also in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday, local medics said at least eight Palestinians had been killed in an air strike near a school housing displaced people in the town. Another 11 people were reportedly killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli tanks were said to have advanced into the city centre."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ny546m7go,At least 10 Palestinians killed in Israeli raids in West Bank,At least 10 Palestinians are killed in separate incidents in the north of the territory.,29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:26.049531,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 10 Palestinians have been killed in a major operation by Israeli forces in the north of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says. Israeli security forces said they had begun ""a counterterrorism operation” in Jenin and Tulkarm overnight and that they had so far killed “five armed terrorists from the air and ground”. It also said another four were killed in an air strike during a simultaneous operation in al-Faraa refugee camp near Tubas. A further death was reported west of Jenin. Local journalists said they had not seen anything of this scope and scale in the West Bank since the days of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, two decades ago. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. Israeli media reported that hundreds of Israeli forces were active in four different cities at least in the north of the West Bank – Jenin, Tulkarm, Tubas and Nablus. The Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank said on Wednesday morning the bodies of seven people had been brought to Tubas governmental hospital and that two others had arrived at Jenin governmental hospital. The Palestinian Red Crescent also reported that at least nine people had been killed across the West Bank, revising down its death toll to 10.  It said they included three who were killed in a drone strike in Misilya, a village near Jenin, and four others who were killed in a drone strike in al-Faraa refugee camp, near Tubas. However, the true figure could be higher, with the governor of Jenin earlier saying that at least 11 people had been killed. In Jenin - a regular flashpoint - troops blocked all but one of the entrances to the city and set up checkpoints. The health ministry said Israeli forces had also surrounded Jenin government hospital and the nearby Ibn Sina hospital, as well as the headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent and the Friends of the Patients society. It warned that they were threatening to storm the hospitals and that doing so would threaten the lives of dozens of patients inside as well as medical staff. ""At this moment, there are patients that are leaving the hospital but after the IDF check their IDs,"" a local journalist inside the government hospital told the BBC. ""It's a scary situation."" The health ministry also accused them of obstructing the work of ambulances, which it said was a violation of international law. The troops have also been searching Jenin refugee camp, which is a base for armed groups and has been the scene of many fierce gun battles in the past. A resident of the camp told the BBC that he could hear explosions nearby and the buzzing of drones overhead, but that there was currently no sign of armed fighters taking on Israeli forces. He said Israeli armoured bulldozers had destroyed the main street through the camp and piled rubble at the entrance to block access. “In the area of Jenin, three armed terrorists who posed a threat to the security forces were eliminated in an aerial strike,” said a joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Shin Bet domestic security agency and Israel Border Police. “Furthermore, in the areas of Jenin and Tulkarm, the forces eliminated two additional armed terrorists, apprehended wanted suspects, and located and confiscated weapons including M-16s, ammunition, and additional military equipment.” They also said forces had exposed and dismantled explosives that had been planted under local roads to attack them. Hamas later put out a statement mourning six men who it said were fighters killed by Israeli forces in Jenin on Wednesday. During a simultaneous operation in al-Faraa refugee camp, near Tubas, “an aircraft struck and eliminated four armed terrorists that posed a threat to the forces”, while forces on the ground confiscated weapons, they added. Masoud Naaja said two of his adult sons were killed in the strike, which he said took place as he gave water to some men who had asked for a drink near his home. ""In seconds, very fast, we felt like something came down on us from the sky and there was an explosion,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""When I put my hand on my chest, it was full of shrapnel and blood."" “I entered the house to find it all damaged from inside,” he added. “My wife asked me what happened and I told her and asked her to go check on our children on the rooftop. She found three of our children - two, may they rest in peace, and one was injured.” A woman in Tubas told the BBC that Israeli forces were “bringing more and more military vehicles and bulldozers” into al-Faraa refugee camp. “We are all on edge and waiting to see if there will be any escalation,"" she said. IDF spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani said the forces were targeting ""a mixture of terror groups and terror cells"", and declined to say how long the operation would last or how many troops were involved. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz put out a strongly worded statement saying the military was acting with “full force” in Jenin and Tulkarm, aiming to “dismantle Iranian-Islamic terror infrastructures established there”. He accused Iran, which backs Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, of trying to “establish an eastern terror front” by funding and smuggling advanced weapons from Jordan. Mr Katz said the threat must be addressed with the same determination of the threat from Gaza. including “temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents” - something we have not heard in an official capacity before. A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas warned that the escalating Israeli raids in the West Bank, alongside the Gaza war, would “lead to dire and dangerous results for which everyone will pay the price”. Nabil Abu Rudeineh called for urgent international action to “curb this extremist [Israeli] government that poses a threat to the stability of the region and the entire world”. Hamas - which is a bitter rival of Mr Abbas’s Fatah movement - condemned the Israeli operation, calling it part of the “brutal genocidal war in Gaza”. A spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office also said such an operation ""risks seriously deepening the already catastrophic situation"", and that the use of air strikes and other military weapons and tactics by Israeli security forces ""violates human rights norms and standards applicable to law enforcement operations"". The UN said 622 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - had been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between 7 October and Monday. At least 602 were killed by Israeli forces, including 126 in air strikes, and 11 by Israeli settlers, it added. Fifteen Israelis, including nine members of Israeli forces and five settlers, were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during the same period, while 10 Israelis were killed in Israel in attacks by Palestinians from the West Bank. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this."

""I don’t dare go on the roof, in case I’m shot,"" one resident says, speaking anonymously. Information inside the camp is scarce, he says, and the streets are empty, as residents stay inside. ""It’s mostly old people and children here,"" he tells me. ""The young people left before the army arrived – it’s bad luck for those who can’t get out."" Jenin, the focus of news networks today, has been living through a news blackout. The Palestinian phone network was down for much of the day - lines cut by the Israeli military operation here, the telecoms company said. The resident I speak to says his family still has water and electricity, and that a small shop nearby was open and selling supplies, under the constant buzz of military drones. As we talk, a few scattered gunshots reverberate over the rooftops from the direction of the camp. ""Yes, I heard them too,"" he says. ""The sound of the drones has increased."" As he is speaking, an armoured bulldozer rumbles towards one of the camp’s main entrances, the road deserted and baking in the afternoon sun. For a few hours last night, explosions and gunfire erupted from the alleyways there, disrupting sleep. But since then, this man says it had been largely quiet - with no sign of house-to-house searches in his neighbourhood, nor of fighters from the camp. ""It’s abnormally quiet,"" he said. The camp has been sealed off by the army since it arrived before dawn on Wednesday - part of a wide, coordinated operation across several centres of the occupied West Bank. Jenin camp is a base for armed Palestinian fighters, but also unarmed civilians.  There have been fierce gun battles here in recent months, as Israeli forces have raided, again and again, looking for them. Army vehicles are also stationed around two of Jenin’s main hospitals. Ambulances are stopped as they approach - approaching and reversing in response to terse instructions broadcast in Arabic from loudspeakers on the army Jeeps. We watched paramedics get out to open the back doors of their ambulance, to show what - or who - was inside. Two female patients were also made to get out and present themselves to soldiers in the Jeeps. Behind them, one of Jenin’s main commercial districts is shuttered and deserted.  Cardboard boxes are scattered across the empty road; fruit sits abandoned on carts under thin cotton covers - the sickly-sweet smell of rotting mangoes fills the silent street. One small grocery shop has been opening in the afternoon – an urban oasis for those who can reach it. Thaeer Shana’at is stocking up on food to deliver to local families in the eastern neighbourhood, where Israeli forces were blocking access, he says. ""The whole of the eastern area - a population of about 20,000 - is sealed off,"" he said.  ""Only ambulances can deliver food. If we go there, we get fired at. There are many areas where we can’t deliver people any food or drink."" He says his wife and baby are still in Jenin camp, as he couldn’t get them out before the army arrived. ""They are scared to open the door,"" he says. ""A sniper is directly stationed in front of the house."" Munir Garwan, who used to work for the municipality, is also waiting to buy food. He says he was a member of the West Bank’s main political party, Fatah, and had spent six years in an Israeli jail for shooting at the army, and belonging to a ""hostile organisation"". ""The occupation [Israel] claims it is trying to stop terrorism. But when the young men get killed, new ones take their place. They are getting nowhere like that."" ""We are not fighting to make someone victorious over the other,"" he said. ""We are fighting for our rights."" As night fell, loud explosions and gunfire were heard again from the direction of the camp. Information has begun to flow again, as communication networks begin to return, circulating details of the ongoing incursion, and the identities of those injured and killed. The news blackout in Jenin is ending, but the news is the last thing people here want to hear."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624qr3mqrzo,Israeli settlers are seizing Palestinian land under cover of war - they hope permanently,"Israeli extremists are working to make settlements in the West Bank irreversible, analysts fear.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:32.634688,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"In the Palestinian village of Battir, where ancient terraces are irrigated by a natural spring, life carries on as it has for centuries. Part of a Unesco World Heritage site, Battir is known for its olive groves and vineyards. But now it is the latest flashpoint over settlements in the occupied West Bank. Israel has approved a new Jewish settlement here, taking away privately owned land for new settler houses and new outposts have been set up without even Israeli authorisation. “They are stealing our land to build their dreams on our catastrophe,” says Ghassan Olyan, whose property is among that seized. Unesco says it is concerned by the settlers’ plans around Battir, but the village is far from an isolated example. All settlements are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees.  “They are not caring about the international law, or local law, and even God’s law,” Mr Olyan says. Last week, Israel’s domestic intelligence chief Ronen Bar wrote to ministers warning that Jewish extremists in the West Bank were carrying out acts of “terror” against Palestinians and causing “indescribable damage” to the country. Since the start of the war in Gaza, there has been an acceleration in settlement growth in the occupied West Bank. Extremists in Israel’s government boast that these changes will prevent an independent Palestinian state from ever being created. There are fears, too, that they seek to prolong the war in Gaza to suit their goals. Yonatan Mizrahi from Peace Now, an Israeli organisation that monitors settlement growth, believes a “mix of rage and fear” in Israeli society after the 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed, is driving settlers to seize more land, with fewer people questioning them. A June survey by the Pew Research Center suggested that 40% of Israelis believed settlements made the country safer, up from 27% in 2013. Meanwhile, 35% of people polled said that the settlements hurt Israel’s security, down from 42%. Mr Mizrahi worries that Jewish extremists in the West Bank are exacerbating an already tense and volatile situation, making it harder than ever to end the Israel-Palestinian conflict. “I think it’s extremely dangerous,” he says. “It’s increasing the hate on both sides.” Since the outbreak of the war, settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank has surged. It had already been on the rise, but in the past 10 months the UN has documented around 1,270 attacks, compared with 856 in all of 2022.  According to the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, during the same period Israeli settler harassment has forced Palestinians out of at least 18 villages in the West Bank, the Palestinian territory between Israel and Jordan that was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and has been occupied ever since. Between 7 October and August 2024, 589 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank – at least 570 by Israeli forces and at least 11 by settlers, according to the UN. They include some said to have been planning attacks as well as unarmed civilians. In the same period, Palestinians killed five settlers and nine members of Israel’s security forces. This week, a Palestinian man aged 40 was reportedly shot dead after settlers and Israeli soldiers entered Wadi al-Rahhel, near Bethlehem. The Israeli military said stones had previously been thrown at an Israeli vehicle nearby. Last month, a 22-year-old Palestinian man was killed when dozens of settlers rampaged through the village of Jit, prompting international condemnation. Israeli security forces have made four arrests and have described the incident as a “severe terror event”. But the track record in such cases is one of virtual impunity. Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din found that, between 2005 and 2023, just 3% of official investigations into settler violence ended in a conviction. In the letter by Ronen Bar, which was leaked to Israeli media, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service said that radical settlers were emboldened by light-handed law enforcement. Settlers live in exclusively Jewish communities set up in parts of the West Bank. Many settlements have the legal support of the Israeli government; others, known as outposts, and often as simple as caravans and corrugated iron sheds, are illegal even under Israeli law. But extremists build them regardless in a bid to seize more land. In July, when the UN’s top court found for the first time that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was illegal, it said the country should halt all settlement activity and withdraw as soon as possible.  Israel’s Western allies have repeatedly described settlements as an obstacle to peace. Israel rejected the finding, saying: “The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land.” Now there are fears that extremists are working to make settlements in the West Bank irreversible. They have rapidly expanded their control over the territory, with the support of the most far-right government in Israel’s history. These extremists are advancing annexation plans in the West Bank and also openly call for settling Gaza once the war is over. Settlers now serve at the heart of Israel’s government, in key ministries. At the very time that world leaders opposed to settlements are voicing renewed enthusiasm for a two-state solution - a long-hoped for peace plan that would create a separate Palestinian state - Israeli religious nationalists, who believe all these lands rightfully belong to Israel, are vowing to make the dream of an independent Palestinian state impossible. Analysts think this is why some politicians are refusing to accept any ceasefire deal. “The reason they don’t want to end the conflict or go into a hostage deal is because they believe that Israel should keep on fighting until it can reach a point where it can stay inside Gaza,” says Tal Schneider, political correspondent for The Times of Israel. “They think for the long term their ideology is more righteous,” she adds. “This is their own logic.” Israeli authorities, meanwhile, have announced plans for five new settlements, including the one in Battir, and declared a record area of land, at least 23 sq km, for the state. This means Israel considers it Israeli land, regardless of whether it is in the occupied Palestinian territories, or privately owned by Palestinians, or both, and Palestinians are prevented from using it. By changing facts on the ground, as the settlers describe it, they hope to move enough Israelis on to the land and build enough on it to make their presence irreversible. Their long-term hope is that Israel formally annexes the land. Outside state-sanctioned land seizures, extremists have also rapidly established settlement outposts.  In one by al-Qanoub, north of Hebron, satellite images showed new caravans and roads had appeared in the months since the start of the war. Meanwhile, an entire Palestinian community has been forced off the land. We drove to al-Qanoub with Ibrahim Shalalda, 50, and his 80-year-old uncle Mohammed, who told us their homes had been destroyed by settlers last November. As we approached, an extremist settler blocked the road with his car. Armed Israelis soon arrived. The group – some Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers, with insignia on their uniforms and one identified as a settlement security officer – stopped us for checks. The settlement guard forced the two Palestinian farmers from the car and searched them. After two hours, the IDF soldiers dispersed the settlers and allowed the BBC car to leave. Israel began settling the West Bank soon after capturing it from Jordan and occupying it more than five decades ago. Successive governments since then have allowed creeping settlement expansion. Today, an estimated three million Palestinians live on the land - excluding Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem - alongside about half a million Jewish Israelis in more than 130 settlements. But a prominent far-right government figure who took office in 2022 is promising to double the number of settlers to a million. Bezalel Smotrich believes that Jews have a God-given right to these lands. He heads one of two far-right, pro-settler parties that veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought into his governing coalition after the 2022 elections returned him to power. Mr Smotrich serves as finance minister but also has a post in the defence ministry, which has allowed him to make sweeping changes to Israeli policies in the West Bank. He has massively invested state finances in settlements, including new roads and infrastructure. But he has also created a new bureaucracy, taking powers from the military, to fast-track settler construction.  In secretly recorded remarks to supporters, Mr Smotrich boasted that he was working towards “changing the DNA” of the system and for de facto annexation that would be “easier to swallow in the international and legal context”. Religious nationalists have sat on the fringes of Israeli politics for decades. But their ideology has slowly become more popular. In the 2022 election, these parties took 13 seats in the 120-seat Israeli parliament and became kingmakers in Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition. During the war, Bezalel Smotrich and fellow radical Itamar Ben-Gvir, now Israel’s national security minister, have repeatedly made comments stoking social division and provoking Israel’s Western allies. After Israel’s military arrested reservists accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee, Mr Ben Gvir said it was “shameful” for Israel to arrest “our best heroes”. This month, Mr Smotrich suggested it might be “justified and moral” to starve Gazans. But it is in the West Bank and Gaza that the far right seeks to make permanent changes. “This is a group of Israelis who have been against any type of compromise with the Palestinians or Israel's other Arab neighbours,” says Anshel Pfeffer, a veteran Israeli journalist and correspondent for The Economist.  And with the war in Gaza, the far right sees a fresh opportunity. Mr Smotrich has called for Palestinian residents to leave, making way for Israelis who could “make the desert bloom”. Although Mr Netanyahu has ruled out restoring Jewish settlements in Gaza, he remains beholden to far-right parties who threaten to collapse his coalition if he signs a “reckless” ceasefire deal to bring home Israeli hostages currently held by Hamas. The logic of the extremists may be one that only a minority of Israelis follow. But it is helping to prolong the war, and dramatically transforming the landscape of the West Bank - causing long-term damage to chances of peace.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w67w47eego,Israel rescues Bedouin hostage held by Hamas in Gaza,"Commandos free Kaid Farhan Elkadi in a ""complex operation"" in southern Gaza, the military says.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:32.885020,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Israeli military says commandos have rescued from an underground tunnel in Gaza a Bedouin Arab hostage who was kidnapped by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel. Kaid Farhan Elkadi, 52, was rescued in a ""complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip"" by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Shin Bet domestic security service, according to a statement. No further details could be published ""due to considerations of the safety of our hostages, the security of our forces, and national security"", it said. Mr Elkadi - the eighth hostage rescued by Israeli forces since the start of the war in Gaza - is in a stable condition in hospital, where he is undergoing examinations. Photographs released by the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba showed him speaking to members of his family while sitting in a hospital armchair. Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that he managed to escape his captors before being rescued, and that the soldiers attempted to understand whether he had been held with other hostages. Mr Elkadi's brother, Hatam, told Haaretz that he was ""a little thin"". ""We told him that everything is fine and that everyone is waiting for him outside,"" he said. ""We've been waiting for this moment for a long time. We hope that all hostages will get this moment, that they will all experience the same excitement and joy,"" he added. ""May all the hostages return, and may all the families feel this feeling."" Mr Elkadi, a father of 11 and grandfather of one, is from a Bedouin village in the Rahat area of the Negev desert. He worked for many years as a security guard at Kibbutz Magen, close to the Israel-Gaza border, where he was abducted 10 months ago. IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video announcement that he could not go into many details about the operation in which he was freed. But he added that he could ""share that Israeli commandos rescued [him] from an underground tunnel, following accurate intelligence"". Footage released by the IDF showed Mr Elkadi sitting down, smiling and speaking to soldiers, including the commander of the 162nd Division, moments after his rescue. A senior Israeli military official confirmed that troops were operating in ""a complex underground system where hostages were suspected to be held"". Mr Elkadi was alone in the tunnel when he was found by Israeli troops when he was rescued, the official added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had congratulated Mr Elkadi in a telephone call and told him that all Israelis were moved by the news. ""We are working relentlessly to return all of our hostages,"" the statement quoted Mr Netanyahu as saying. ""We are doing this in two main ways: negotiations and rescue operations. The two of these together require our military presence on the ground, and constant military pressure."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described the rescue as ""miraculous"". But it stressed that ""military operations alone cannot free the remaining hostages who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror"", and that ""a negotiated deal is the only way forward"". ""We urgently call on the international community to maintain pressure on Hamas to accept the proposed deal and release all hostages.” The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,430 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to broker a ceasefire deal that would see Hamas release the 104 hostages still being held, including 34 who are presumed dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Indirect talks have continued in Cairo in recent days, but so far there has been no sign of a breakthrough over key sticking points. They include Mr Netanyahu’s demand that Israel keep troops along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected. Two other Bedouin Arabs - Yousef Zyadna and his son, Hamza - are among the remaining hostages who are still alive, while the body of a third, Mhamad el-Atrash, is still being held by Hamas.  Another Bedouin, Hisham al-Sayed, has been held captive in Gaza since 2015."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kjzk75eplo,Diseases spread in Gaza as sewage contaminates camps and coast,Satellite images show the impact of the damage to Gaza's critical water and sanitation systems.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:32.975779,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The waters on parts of Gaza’s Mediterranean coastline have started turning brown as health experts warn of the spread of open sewage and diseases across the territory. Satellite images, analysed by BBC Arabic, show what appears to be a large discharge of sewage spill off the coast of Deir al-Balah. A local official told BBC Arabic displaced people in nearby camps are sending their sewage straight to sea. “It is because of the increase in the number of displaced people and many are connecting their own pipes to the rainwater drainage system,” said Abu Yazan Ismael Sarsour, head of the Deir al-Balah emergency committee. Wim Zwijnenburg, an environmental expert from the Pax for Peace organisation, confirmed that wastewater appeared to be heading into the sea from nearby crowded camps, after examining the satellite pictures. The sewage discharge in the images, captured on 2 August, covered an area of over 2 sq km (0.8 sq miles). Satellite images show the discharge first started appearing in June and that it grew steadily over the next two months. It is not clear if the coastal pollution is still growing as more recent satellite image are not available. Intensive Israeli bombardment has led to the collapse of Gaza’s waste water management infrastructure, a UN environmental report concluded in June. The Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, told BBC Arabic a dedicated humanitarian taskforce had taken action to improve the sewage system in Gaza. In recent months, Cogat co-ordinated the restoration of water wells and desalination facilities, as well as the extension of water pipes in Gaza, according to its statement. The BBC is not able to independently verify specific improvements to Gaza’s sewage infrastructure. Israel, alongside Egypt, does not allow independent journalists into Gaza except on controlled and brief visits with the Israeli military. Health experts, though, are sounding the alarm about the spread of waterborne diseases, after a 10-month-old baby was partially paralysed after contracting polio - the first registered case in Gaza for 25 years. UN and World Health Organization (WHO) officials also called for two one-week ceasefires so they can vaccinate 600,000 children in Gaza. But observers say the delivery of vaccines would probably hit the same barriers affecting the flow of other humanitarian aid, making distribution slow and extremely difficult.  The destruction of Gaza's health care system will also make any vaccination programme an enormous challenge. In a response to BBC Arabic, Cogat insisted there were no restrictions on medical aid. In a later social media statement, Cogat said “an additional 60,000 polio vaccines will be delivered to vaccinate over one million children” in the coming weeks. The charity Oxfam told BBC Arabic a quarter of Gaza's population had already become ill because of waterborne diseases. “We are seeing a catastrophic health crisis unfolding in front of our eyes,"" said Lama Abdul Samad, a water and sanitation expert at Oxfam. “Polio is a waterborne disease and it is directly linked to the sanitation situation.” “The sanitation infrastructure has been damaged severely to the point that it is flooding the streets and the neighbourhoods, and people are basically living adjacent to puddles of sewage,"" she added. New photos and satellite images analysed by BBC Arabic illustrate how the problem of untreated sewage in Gaza has been getting steadily worse. The Sheikh Radwan Lagoon in northern Gaza, which was once a source of clean rainwater, appears to be overflowing with dirty water. The lagoon has clearly been contaminated by raw sewage, Ms Abdul Samad said after assessing the pictures. Several Palestinians living nearby have complained to BBC Arabic’s Gaza Lifeline emergency radio service of the overflowing waste water, stench and rodents coming out of the lagoon. “Raw sewage is running into our property because of the overflowing Sheikh Radwan Lagoon,” Ibrahim Ramzi said. Meanwhile, Ghada al-Haddad, an aid worker in central Gaza, sent BBC Arabic a video from a makeshift camp where sewage had built up into a pond next to displaced people. She described the smell as ""overpowering"" and ""unendurable”. Polio is just one part the heath crisis facing Gaza. Earlier this month, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, reported 40,000 cases of Hepatitis A – which can also be transmitted through ingestion of contaminated water - in Gaza since the start of the war compared to only 85 in the same period beforehand. Public health experts are also warning of a potential cholera epidemic. Aid agencies say doctors in Gaza are also struggling to treat a huge caseload of dysentery, pneumonia, and severe skin diseases because of the collapse of the health sector. “The reason behind the spread of these bacterial diseases is the complete lack of a sanitation system,” paediatric consultant Dr Ahmed al-Farra explained. He said the problems included the “mixing of clean ground water and sewage, the severe overpopulation, the extreme heat, the lack of ventilation, the overpopulated tents, [and] the oversharing of toilets”. The UN estimates the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been internally displaced since last autumn. Many people are living in shelters with just one toilet for 600 people, a World Health Organization official told reporters in July. On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented assault on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Since the attack, the Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed more than 40,200 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89w851xw5ko,"Six killed in West Bank strike and settler attack, Palestinian ministry says",Medics say five were killed in a strike in Tulkarm and one was shot dead by settlers near Bethlehem.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:33.063452,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least five people, including two children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike on an urban refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed the strike, on Nur Shams camp near the city of Tulkarm, saying it had targeted what it called the command room of a ""terror cell"". Separately, the health ministry said one person had been shot dead and three injured during an attack by Israeli settlers near Bethlehem. The IDF said it was investigating the reports. There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October.  The UN said last Wednesday that 128 Palestinians, including 26 children, had been killed in Israeli air strikes in the West Bank since 7 October. Overall, 607 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, including 11 by Israeli settlers, over the same period, it added. Fifteen Israelis, including nine members of Israeli forces and five settlers, were also killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the UN. Another 10 Israelis were killed in attacks in Israel by Palestinians from the West Bank. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that an Israeli drone carried out the strike on a house in Nur Shams camp on Monday night and four loud explosions were heard. The Palestinian health ministry identified the five people killed as Mohannad Qarawi, 19, Jibril Jibril, 20, Adnan Jaber, 15, Mohammed Yusif, 49, and Mohammed Elayyan, 16. Jibril Jibril was a member of Hamas who had been released from an Israeli prison in November as part of an exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, according to the Palestinian reports. Nur Shams has been targeted by the IDF several times in recent months. In April, the Palestinian Red Crescent said 14 people had been killed in a two-day Israeli operation there. Later on Monday, the health ministry said a 40-year-old man named Khalil Salem Khalawi was shot dead during an attack by Israeli settlers in the Palestinian village of Wadi Rahhal, south of Bethlehem. Three other people were wounded, it added. Wafa cited the head of the village council, Hamdi Ziada, as saying that shots were fired as settlers attacked homes near the local boys’ school. He also claimed that Israeli forces had entered the village to provide protection for the settlers and fired tear-gas at residents. Israel’s Ynet news website reported that Mr Khalawi was an Israeli Arab and that he was shot dead by IDF soldiers who arrived in Wadi Rahhal following a claim by settlers that stones had been thrown at an Israeli vehicle. Settlers also clashed with residents of the village, it said. The IDF said it was looking into reports, which come two weeks after a Palestinian man was shot dead during a settler attack on the village of Jit. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this."

The allegations were made on The Ditch website. It claimed that a cargo flight bound for Israel flew through Irish airspace earlier in 2024. A spokesperson for the Department of Transport said carrying weapons of war on a civil aircraft in Irish airspace was prohibited unless an exemption was granted by the transport minister. They confirmed no applications had been received, or exemptions granted in 2023 or so far in 2024. The flight was by a civil air operator and the Department of Transport said it was engaging with it. On Monday, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris said he was seeking information on the reports. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv4zede8jo,Lebanese relief as Hezbollah and Israel seem to step back from brink,Both signalled they did not want an all-out war after the biggest cross-border strikes in 10 months.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:33.226388,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"For almost a month, many here in Lebanon have been on tenterhooks, waiting for Hezbollah to retaliate against Israel. The region was waiting also, wondering if this would be the spark for a wider war. Everyone knew the powerful Iranian-backed group would seek revenge for Israel’s assassination on 30 July of a top military commander, Fuad Shukr. The Israelis managed to hunt him down deep in Hezbollah’s heartland of South Beirut. That was both a strategic loss and a public humiliation. Just hours later, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, in what bore all the hallmarks of another Israeli operation. But Iran continues to signal that its retaliation could be a long-term project. At 05:15 on Sunday, Hezbollah made its move, launching more than 300 Katyusha rockets and “a large number of drones” across the border into Israel. This was revenge served cold. It was carefully calibrated, and it was less than some had expected. Hezbollah said it targeted 11 military bases and barracks, and claimed its attack was a success. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said most of the rockets missed their mark. Either way, Hezbollah did not train its sights on major cities in Israel, or on critical infrastructure. And it did not bring out its big guns. The group - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US - is believed to have more arms than many nations. Israel had got in first, at 04:30, flooding the sky with fighter jets targeting Hezbollah firing positions. The IDF said this “pre-emptive strike"" destroyed thousands of rocket launchers. It was the biggest flare-up here since the Gaza war began last October, after Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel in a single day. Since then, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel across their shared border, showing support for its ally Hamas, and proclaiming solidarity with the people of Gaza. So where are we now, one day on? Surprisingly, perhaps, the Middle East may be a little safer. Both sides have delivered a message, but stopped short of all-out war. And Hezbollah has signalled it’s ready to close the Fuad Shukr chapter - for the moment. “We reserve our right to continue the response at a later point, but for now, the people can be at ease and carry on with their lives,” said Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. After a tense month, that was a welcome message for many here. He was addressing his supporters on TV from an undisclosed location - he might be at the top of Israel’s assassination list. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday’s strikes against Hezbollah were “not the end of the story”. But diplomats told the Reuters news agency that both sides had exchanged messages saying they didn’t want a further escalation. Here in southern Lebanon, there is already a return to the usual low-level conflict. Israel has just attempted another assassination, leaving a burning car on the scorching streets of Sidon, a port city. Local sources say the target was a Hamas leader, who managed to jump out in time. Along the coast in the city of Tyre, Israeli jets are swooping low, breaking the sound barrier - but the beach below is more crowded. “Everything feels calm today,” said a young man in his 20s who did not want to be named. “Everything returned to normal. The streets have been quiet, but people have come back out. Today, people can breathe.” Hezbollah said it delayed its retaliation to give time for talks on a ceasefire in Gaza. But the latest round of talks in Egypt has ended with no apparent progress. And while the war in Gaza drags on, in all its horror, it is fuelling instability across the Middle East."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze5w2wd4x0o,Has Israel taken enough action to prevent alleged incitement to genocide?,"In January, the ICJ ordered Israel to prevent public statements inciting genocide - critics say it’s not doing enough.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:33.315496,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"“Burn Gaza now, nothing less!” When the deputy speaker of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, posted this comment on X in November, the platform blocked him and asked him to delete it. Nissim Vaturi did as they asked, and his account has since been reactivated, but he did not apologise. His comment is one of many controversial remarks that have been made by some high-profile Israelis as the country’s armed forces carry out air strikes and ground operations in Gaza, in response to Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. On the day of the attacks, he had posted: “Now we all have one common goal - erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth.” That post, which is still visible on X, was cited in South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the Gaza war. Israel has called the case ""wholly unfounded"" and based on ""biased and false claims"". As part of an interim judgement in January, the ICJ ruled that Israel must prevent public statements inciting genocide. Although the court does not have the power to enforce this, Israel agreed to submit a report detailing the action it had taken to investigate and prosecute possible instances of incitement. The court confirmed that the report was received in February, but has not made its contents public. Some legal experts believe Israel is not doing enough to investigate potential cases. “Israelis who incite genocide or use genocidal rhetoric are immune from prosecution,” says Israeli human rights lawyer, Michael Sfard. Proving incitement to genocide, which is a crime under international and Israeli law, is difficult. Genocide is defined as acts intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. But distinguishing between inciting genocide and inciting violence or racism - and what could be considered free speech - can be complex. The BBC has looked at several pronouncements made since the ICJ’s order to see if they could break the ruling and consulted legal experts for their assessment. And although this judgement was directed at Israel, we have also examined language used by some Hamas officials who have made speeches about repeating their attack of 7 October. A pro-Palestinian human rights organisation made up of a network of experts and researchers around the world who monitor the conflict, Law for Palestine, has looked at cases where it believes Israeli officials and other public figures have incited genocide. Its list includes some statements by Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Mr Ben-Gvir has been advocating a policy to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza, saying Israelis should settle there. He leads an ultranationalist party which is widely criticised for espousing racially discriminatory, anti-Arab policies. He has previous convictions from an Israeli court - which date from before he entered government - for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. Two days after the ICJ ruling in January, he advocated a policy to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza and replace them with Israeli settlers. He said that to avoid a repeat of Hamas’s attack on Israel “we need to return home and control the territory [Gaza]… encouraging migration and giving the death penalty to terrorists”, proposing that any emigration should be voluntary. “We consider the calling to displacement of the Gaza population as part of the ethnic cleansing that is ongoing in Gaza,” says Law for Palestine’s founder, Ihsan Adel. He believes those calls should be considered incitement to genocide, and that genocide is happening - an accusation Israel denies. Not everyone agrees with his assessment, though. “I'm definitely not going to defend such statements, but they do not rise to the level of genocide,” says Anne Herzberg, a legal adviser at NGO Monitor, which reports on international NGO activity from a pro-Israel perspective. Neither Mr Ben-Gvir nor Mr Vaturi responded to BBC requests for comment. The link between what politicians say and what Israeli soldiers say was a core part of South Africa’s case at the ICJ. In a YouTube video from late 2023, a group of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers can be heard chanting: “Occupy, expel and settle.” And soldiers have made other videos since the ICJ ruling in January mocking and celebrating the destruction of Gaza. The IDF told us that it examines reports of videos online and that if a criminal offence is suspected, the military police investigate and “in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the footage is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly”. The spotlight has also fallen on Israel’s religious leaders. Rabbi Eliyahu Mali attracted attention after he gave a talk in March at a conference for Israel’s Zionist yeshivas - Jewish religious schools with a strong belief in the State of Israel. Rabbi Mali is the head of a yeshiva that is part of a network that receives funding from Israel‘s Ministry of Defence. Its students mix Torah study with military service. He described the talk as being about the “treatment of the civilian population in Gaza during the war”. A clip of it was shared online. After citing a 12th Century Jewish scholar on holy wars, Rabbi Mali said: “[And if so] the basic rule that we have when we are fighting a mitzvah war, in this case Gaza, according to the scriptures, ‘You shall not let a soul remain alive,’ the explanation is very clear - if you don’t kill them, they will kill you.” In Judaism, a mitzvah war is one which includes defending Jewish life and sovereignty and is considered obligatory as opposed to one of choice. We contacted Rabbi Mali and a response, sent on his behalf, said that his words had been “grossly misrepresented by excerpts being taken out of context”. It said that he had set out what the position was in ancient times but that he had “made it very clear that anyone following the Biblical commandment today would be causing the army and the nation extreme harm” and that under national law “it is forbidden to harm the civilian population from a child to an old man”. We watched the full talk and on a few occasions he reminded the audience of those points, including in the conclusion, and also saying at the start: “You need to do exactly what the army orders say.” However, during the talk, he specifically mentioned the people of Gaza saying: “I think there is a difference between the civilian population in other places and the civilian population in Gaza,” adding an unsubstantiated claim that “95% to 98% are interested in our demise, that's a majority, that's stupefying.” When an audience member asked about babies he replied: ”The same… The Torah is saying: ‘You shall not let a soul remain alive’… Today he’s a baby, tomorrow he’s a boy, tomorrow he’s a warrior.” In the talk, the rabbi also recounted what he said to his son, who went to fight after the 7 October attacks. He said he should “kill everything that moves”. He explained his position by adding that his son’s commander had told him the same thing and that he instructed his son to ”listen to the commander’s orders”. Later, he reiterated that he did not expect soldiers to do what was laid out in the Torah. He said that if the laws of the state contradicted the laws of the Torah, it was the state law that should be followed and “the laws of the state only want to kill the terrorists and not the civilian population”. Eitay Mack, a lawyer from the Israeli group Tag Meir that campaigns against racism and discrimination, says he has asked police to investigate the rabbi on suspicion of incitement to commit genocide, violence and terrorism. He says he is still waiting to hear if the investigation he requested will be carried out. Another claim made by South Africa at the ICJ hearing was about “genocidal messages being routinely broadcast - without censure or sanction - in Israeli media”. In February, on the right-wing Channel 14,  journalist Yaki Adamker said: ""The Gazans, as far as I am concerned, can starve to death. What do I care about them?” In April, an Israeli journalist on the most-watched channel in the country, Channel 12, Yehuda Schlesinger, echoed similar sentiments, saying: “There are no innocents in the Gaza Strip, there aren’t. They voted for Hamas, they want Hamas.” For Anne Herzberg, from NGO Monitor, this may show “a disturbing lack of empathy for people in Gaza and what they’re going through,” but “it’s not calling for genocide”. The BBC contacted both broadcasters but received no response. Yehuda Schlesinger replied, highlighting the atrocities of 7 October. When it comes to whether the authorities should regulate what is broadcast more tightly, Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard warns that “regulators, which is the state, have to make sure that public broadcasting is not exploited” by people making provocative comments. While the ICJ ruling on preventing inciting genocide was directed at Israel, Hamas has also been accused of making statements with “genocidal intent”. “The annihilationist language of Hamas's charter is repeated regularly by its leaders,” says Tal Becker, legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry. In 2021, Yahya Sinwar, who has just become the overall leader of Hamas said: “We support the elimination of Israel through jihad and armed struggle, this is our doctrine.” And, more recently, some Hamas officials have claimed they want to repeat the 7 October attacks, during which about 1,200 people were killed - mostly civilians - and 251 were taken hostage. In November, a member of Hamas's political bureau, Ghazi Hamad, said: “We must teach Israel a lesson and we will do this again and again.” Around the same time, Hamas leader abroad, Khaled Mashaal, said that 7 October “opened a highway towards eliminating Israel"". Hamas did not respond to the BBC’s request for comment. Many want to see the group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, EU and other countries - held to account. “It’s quite clear that they do have genocidal intent, and we hear very little about investigating Hamas, and I think that's a real missing piece in this entire conflict,” says Anne Herzberg from NGO Monitor. The UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese - whose own criticisms of Israeli actions have been strongly contested, in particular in Israel and the United States - agrees Hamas leaders should be held accountable. But she says: “When assessing genocide, one is to look at the words spoken by leaders, but also the capacity to commit genocide, which Hamas per se doesn't seem to have.” Unlike Israel, Hamas cannot be taken to the ICJ because it is not a state. However a different body, the International Criminal Court (ICC), can hold individuals to account. In May its prosecutor applied for arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh (Haniyeh has since been killed in Iran and Israel says it killed Deif in Gaza) for crimes against humanity, and war crimes. He also sought warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Hamas and Israel reacted with outrage. As for what Israeli authorities are doing to prevent and prosecute people suspected of inciting violence, the country’s attorney general and state attorney have acknowledged that any statements calling for intentional harm to civilians “may amount to a criminal offence, including the offence of incitement”. Just before the ICJ hearing in January they said that several cases were being examined. Recently however, Haaretz reported that the state prosecutor recommended that no criminal investigations be opened against senior public figures, including ministers and members of Knesset, who have ""called to harm civilians in the Gaza Strip”. The final decision rests with the attorney general. The BBC contacted Israel’s state attorney, police commissioner and Ministry of Justice for comment. Only the Ministry of Justice replied, saying they have to balance “the constitutional right to freedom of speech… while safeguarding against harmful incitement”. They added: “Law enforcement authorities constantly act to curtail incitement offences, and these efforts have been prioritised by Israel's attorney general in recent months.” And as the ICJ continues to work toward a final ruling in its case, people continue to die - since October more than 40,000 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in Gaza, according to its Hamas-run health ministry.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr40dz5524qo,UN urges calm after Israel and Hezbollah trade strikes,The UN says Sunday's major cross-border attacks were a threat to regional security and stability.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:33.415793,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"UN Secretary General António Guterres has said he is “deeply concerned” after Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement mounted their biggest round of cross-border strikes since the war in Gaza began. On Sunday, Israeli jets hit dozens of sites across southern Lebanon in what it said were pre-emptive strikes to prevent a much wider attack, and Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel. Mr Guterres warned that their actions put civilians at risk, as well as threatening regional security and stability. The US said it was working to avoid a further escalation in hostilities, and both sides suggested they were not interested in one. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Since October, more than 560 people have been reported killed by Lebanon's health ministry, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, while 26 civilians and 24 soldiers have been killed in Israel, according to authorities. Almost 200,000 people have also been displaced on both sides of the border. The Israeli attack on Hezbollah began before dawn Sunday, when the military said about 100 jets bombed thousands rocket launchers at more than 40 sites in southern Lebanon. The strikes were launched after ""extensive preparation"" for a large-scale aerial attack by Hezbollah were detected, according to the military. Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed in the strikes along with another fighter from the allied Amal movement. Hezbollah said it had targeted and hit 11 military facilities in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights with 340 rockets and a “large number” of drones. It described the barrage as a response to the assassination of senior military commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on 30 July. The Israeli military said it intercepted “many of the threats” launched by Hezbollah and that the projectiles which landed did “very little damage”. However, it also said a navy soldier was killed in combat in northern Israel, with local media reporting that he had been on a patrol boat when an interceptor missile engaged a drone. On Sunday evening, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a televised speech to his supporters that appeared to seek to draw a line under the escalation. He declared the group’s “first response” for the retaliation for Shukr’s assassination had been completed “as planned”, although he noted that its impact was still being assessed. ""If the result is not sufficient, we will reserve the right to respond at another time,” he said. In the meantime, he added, the people of Lebanon “can be at ease and carry on with their lives, as the country has been in tension for a month now”. Earlier, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a cabinet meeting that “what happened today is not the end of the story”. “We are striking Hezbollah with surprising crushing blows,” he said. “Three weeks ago, we eliminated its chief-of-staff and today we thwarted its attack plan.” “Nasrallah in Beirut and [Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north, and returning our residents securely to their homes.” The UN secretary general called for “immediate de-escalation and on the parties to urgently and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities”, a spokesperson said. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan expressed hope that Sunday’s events would not lead to an all-our regional war. ""We have worked round the clock with partners and allies, moving military assets, engaging in intensive diplomacy both publicly and privately behind the scenes to avert that outcome,” he told reporters during a visit to Halifax, Canada. Diplomats told the Reuters news agency that the two sides had exchanged messages saying that neither wanted to take things any further. Mr Sullivan also said US officials had been “feverishly working” at talks in Cairo in recent days to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, which the White House believes is key to restoring calm on the Israel-Lebanon border. However, there has so far been no sign of a breakthrough. Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that its representatives had left the Egyptian capital to review the outcome of the talks, which they did not attend. Egyptian security sources told Reuters news agency that neither Hamas nor Israel had agreed to several compromises presented by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators."

Dr Matt Newport, who is from Ramsbottom and works at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, has been in the war-torn region three times this year with charity UK-Med.  He said that 40% of the ""dramatically injured patients"" UK-Med field hospitals received were children.   Dr Newport said the experience had made him hug his daughter ""that little bit tighter"".  The anaesthetist said he regularly encountered gunshot wounds and lost limbs. ""It’s the huge number of wounded children and women that has left a real impact on me - right down to babies just a day or two old and weighing just a couple of kilograms,"" he said. ""As a first-time father of a two-year-old, seeing displaced, frightened, parentless, and traumatically injured children has been quite challenging,"" he added. He and his colleagues often found themselves working to the sound of gunfire and explosions.  Dr Newport, 37, said the conflict ""needs to come to an end"", with ""civilians coming to harm through no fault of their own on both sides"". He spoke of ""huge issues"" getting medical supplies across the border and ""running the gauntlet"" of organised criminal gangs with assault rifles.  He said that working in Gaza had made him reflect on how grateful he was for the NHS. “Returning to the NHS, I have any bit of equipment and medication I need at the drop of a hat and it makes me really sad that the excellent Palestinian medics I worked with often don’t have the most basic resources through no fault of their own,"" said Dr Newport The medic said he planned to ""keep going back and doing what I can"", adding that he felt it important to show his daughter how important it was to do such humanitarian work. The UK-Med charity is part of the UK Government’s humanitarian response to the Israel/Gaza crisis.  A UK-Med spokesperson said the charity was now running two Foreign Office-funded field hospitals based in Al Mawasi and Deir El Balah, which have treated more than 100,000 patients in Gaza so far. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza estimates that more than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since conflict broke out following the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Israel has consistently questioned the credibility of the information. In May, the Foreign Minister Israel Katz described it as ""fake data from a terrorist organisation"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy343z53l1o,What are Harris and Trump's policies?,"Economy, immigration, abortion and other top issues - here is where the two candidates stand.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:41.190429,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on different issues. Harris has said her day-one priority would be trying to reduce food and housing costs for working families. She promises to ban price-gouging on groceries, help first-time home buyers and provide incentives to increase housing supply. Trump has promised to “end inflation and make America affordable again”.  He has promised to deliver lower interest rates, something the president does not control, and he says deporting undocumented immigrants will ease pressure on housing. Harris has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and she continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. Trump has struggled to find a consistent message in recent weeks.  The three judges he appointed to the Supreme Court while president were pivotal in overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, a 1973 ruling known as Roe v Wade. Harris was tasked with tackling the root causes of the southern border crisis and helped raise billions of dollars of private money to make regional investments aimed at stemming the flow north. Record numbers of people crossed from Mexico at the end of 2023 but the numbers have fallen since. In this campaign, she has toughened her stance and emphasised her experience as a prosecutor in California taking on human traffickers. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the construction of a wall and increasing enforcement. But he urged Republicans to ditch a hardline, cross-party border bill, backed by Harris. He has also promised the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history. Experts told the BBC this would face legal challenges. Harris wants to raise taxes on big businesses and Americans making $400,000 (£305,000) a year. But she has also unveiled a number of measures that would ease the tax burden on families, including an expansion of child tax credits. Trump proposes a number of tax cuts worth trillions, including an extension of his 2017 cuts which mostly helped the wealthy. He says he will pay for them through higher growth and tariffs on imports. Analysts say both tax plans will add to the ballooning deficit, but Trump’s by more. Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. She has pledged, if elected, to ensure the US and not China wins ""the competition for the 21st Century"". She has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza. Trump has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel but said little on how he would end the war in Gaza. Harris has criticised Trump’s sweeping plan to put tariffs on imports, calling it a national tax on working families which will cost each household $4,000 a year. She is expected to have a more targeted approach to taxing imports. Trump has made tariffs a central pledge in this campaign. He has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods, and much higher ones on those from China. Harris, as vice-president, helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy, and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programmes.  But she has dropped her opposition to fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil opposed by environmentalists. Trump, while in the White House, rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles.  In this campaign he has vowed to expand Arctic drilling and attacked electric cars. Harris has been part of a White House administration which has reduced prescription drug costs and capped insulin prices at $35. Trump has said he will not renew his attempts while president to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people.  He has called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but that could be opposed by Republicans in Congress. Harris has tried to contrast her experience as a prosecutor with the fact Trump has been convicted of a crime.  Trump has vowed to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. Harris has made preventing gun violence a key pledge, and she and Tim Walz - both gun owners - often advocate for tighter laws. But they will find that moves like expanding background checks or banning assault weapons will need the help of Congress. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, the constitutional right to bear arms. Addressing the National Rifle Association in May, he said he was their best friend."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8xwxjy4y7o,WHO exceeds target for Gaza polio vaccinations as campaign continues,"The UN agency says localised pauses in the fighting have allowed 161,030 children to be inoculated.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:41.291190,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The World Health Organization (WHO) says polio vaccinations of children in central Gaza have ""surpassed the target"" in the first two days of its immunisation campaign. Dr Rik Peeperkorn, the UN agency's representative in the Palestinian territories, said 161,030 children under the age of 10 were vaccinated on Sunday and Monday - above the projection of 156,500. The difference was probably the result of an underestimate of the population crowded into the area, he explained. Israel and Hamas agreed to a series of localised pauses in the fighting to allow health workers to administer vaccines after Gaza's first confirmed case of polio in 25 years left a 10-month-old partially paralysed last month. The pauses are taking effect between 06:00 and 15:00 local time in three separate stages across central, southern and northern parts of Gaza.  The first three-day stage began in Deir al-Balah governorate on Sunday. It will shift to the southern governorates of Rafah and Khan Younis on Thursday and then move to North Gaza and Gaza City. Dr Peeperkorn said the pauses had been ""going well"" until now. But there were still ""10 days to go at least"" for the first round of the vaccination campaign, he said, while a second round to repeat the immunisations will start in four weeks.  He said some children were believed to be living outside the agreed zone for the pauses in the south and that negotiations were continuing in order to allow health workers to reach them.  The aim is to vaccinate a total of 640,000 children. ""We need to cover a minimum of 90% of those children to stop the transmission within Gaza and to avoid polio spread, international spread of polio to surrounding countries,"" Dr Peeperkorn said.  Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause disfigurement and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five. Humanitarian groups have blamed the re-emergence of polio in Gaza on disruption to child vaccination programmes as well as massive damage to water and sanitation systems caused by the war. The mother of the partially paralysed baby, Abdulrahman Abu Judyan, told the BBC last week that her son was supposed to receive routine vaccinations on 7 October - the day Hamas attacked Israel and triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza. “I feel a lot of guilt that he didn’t get the vaccination. But I couldn’t give it to him because of our circumstances,” Niveen said.  She desperately hoped her son could be taken outside Gaza for treatment.  “He wants to live and walk like other children,” she said."

Safe Haven for Donkeys was set up in Haywards Heath in 2000 with the aim of helping working donkeys in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The charity is funding a mobile first aid team to treat donkeys and horses needing veterinary intervention amid the Israel-Gaza conflict. Chief executive Andy Foxcroft said donkeys had become the main mode of transport in Gaza for humans. With fuel scarce and many vehicles damaged, donkeys and horses are used to transport people and items like water and medicine. However, the animals suffer from malnourishment, dehydration and wounds, the charity said. Mr Foxcroft said the charity were working tirelessly to help the animals. “Our shipment of food and medicines are desperately needed in Gaza,” he said. “The donkeys will only be able to support their owners and the community if they are fed and cared for.” Since April, the team has treated approximately 800 donkeys and horses. The doctor leading the team, Dr Saif, said a donkey was used to help transport a pregnant woman to hospital. “There was no way for an ambulance or car to take her from home to the hospital, due to the danger involved, so we had to use a donkey. “She had twins in the hospital, and it was a donkey that saved her and her babies’ lives.” Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Steve Brisley's sister, Lianne Sharabi, nieces Noiya, 16, Yahel, 13, and their family dog were murdered on 7 October last year, when Hamas launched a series of cross-border attacks from the Gaza Strip on southern Israel. Mr Brisley, from Bridgend, said he last heard of his brother-in-law Eli's survival in November. He told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Hope is all we've got"" as they ""don't know whether he's alive or dead"". ""It was a normal Saturday morning for me. I scrolled through the news and saw that rockets were coming from Gaza into Israel. ""I sent a message to my sister, as I usually do, but I never got a response to that message,"" he said. His family still do not know what happened to Eli, or if he saw events that day. ""We know he was alive in November but that is the sole piece of news we've had,"" he added. Mr Brisley said Lianne was a talented musician and singer, who retrained as a dental nurse in recent years. He said: ""Once we had confirmation about Lianne and the girls, I had to go and tell my parents that their only daughter was dead. ""It's the sort of thing they will never get over. You don't expect that you're going to outlive your children."" Speaking about his nieces, he said: ""What they might have become is what you feel has been robbed from you"". ""It's something you have to get on with but it's not something any of us will get over."" The Foreign Office said a team of experts was providing ongoing support to family members in the UK and Israel. It said it will ""continue to use every diplomatic lever to bring about a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, in co-ordination with international partners"". ""The fighting must stop now. We need an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and all hostages still cruelly detained by Hamas must be released.  ""We also need to see the urgent delivery of unfettered aid into Gaza."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr40d32zqz4o,UN says Gaza aid operation paused due to evacuation orders,An official says staff cannot operate in central areas because of relocations and safety concerns.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:41.600114,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The United Nations says it has had to temporarily suspend its aid operation in the Gaza Strip because of Israeli military evacuation orders in the centre of the Palestinian territory. A senior UN official told reporters that its humanitarian staff had been unable to operate on Monday because of safety concerns. Evacuation orders covering parts of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in and around the central town of Deir al-Balah - where the UN has its main operations centre - had forced staff to relocate quickly and leave equipment behind, they said. However, the official stressed that UN agencies would not be leaving Gaza and were now trying to find somewhere to operate safely. The Israeli military has said it issues evacuation orders to try to protect civilians as it operates against Hamas and other armed groups. Earlier on Monday, it said troops were continuing to “dismantle terrorist infrastructure” and “eliminate terrorists” on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Up to 88.5% of Gaza has been placed under evacuation orders since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, according to the UN, which is the primary provider and distributor of humanitarian aid in the territory. That has forced an estimated 1.8 million people to shelter inside the humanitarian zone, which spans only about 41 sq km (15.8 sq miles) and lacks critical infrastructure and basic services. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,430 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Local officials in Deir al-Balah say about 250,000 people have been forced to flee several neighbourhoods of the town since 16 August, when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) started to issue evacuation orders there. Humanitarian staff from various UN agencies, NGOs and service providers, along with their families, have also been displaced as a result of the orders. The UN said a new order issued on Sunday that covered one block in the south of the town had affected 15 UN and NGO premises, as well as four UN warehouses. ""We're unable to deliver today with the conditions that we're in,"" the senior UN official said on Monday. ""As of this morning, we're not operating in Gaza."" However, UN staff have been instructed to find solutions to allow operations to resume. ""We're not leaving because the people need us there,"" the official said. ""We're trying to balance the need of the population with the need for safety and security of the UN personnel."" Sam Rose, a senior deputy field director for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) who is in Deir al-Balah, warned that both UN staff and Palestinian civilians were “being squeezed into ever smaller areas of Gaza”. “The humanitarian zone declared by Israel has shrunk. It is now about 11% of the entire Gaza Strip,” he told reporters in New York via video link. “This isn’t just 11% of land that is fit for habitation, fit for services, fit for life. These are sand dunes, these are crowded areas, where people are living cheek by jowl, doing whatever they can to get by.” “It is precisely in these circumstances that polio has recently re-emerged in Gaza, with a small number of cases. It could spread very rapidly,” he added.  “Malnourished children. A decimated healthcare sector. Very poor water and sanitation. People living amid garbage, amid lakes of sewage. They’re stressed, they’re anxious, their immune systems are suppressed.” Mr Rose said Unrwa and other UN agencies had been focusing their efforts on the polio vaccination campaign due to start this Saturday, which plans to inoculate more than 640,000 children and prevent an outbreak. “The vaccines have come in. We’re calling for calm, for humanitarian pauses that will allow the vaccination programmes to pass and be implemented successfully.” Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has also warned that the latest evacuation order in Deir al-Balah also affected areas close to al-Aqsa hospital, the town’s main medical facility. The medical charity said in a statement on X that an explosion about 250m (820ft) from the hospital on Sunday had triggered panic, with many people choosing to leave afterwards. “As a result, MSF is considering whether to suspend wound care for the time being, while trying to maintain life-saving treatment. From around 650 patients, only 100 remain in the hospital, with seven in intensive care unit, according to the ministry of health,” it added. “This situation is unacceptable. Al-Aqsa has been operating well beyond capacity for weeks due to the lack of alternatives for patients. All warring parties must respect the hospital, as well as patients' access to medical care.” Dr Anas Ibrahim, an emergency physician at the hospital, told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme on Monday that the situation there was “indescribable”. “As the evacuation news spread, patients with fractures and wounds all began to evacuate the hospital for fear of being exposed to an offensive,” he said. “Feelings of terror, fear and panic have overwhelmed all people at the hospital. Everyone is afraid now... everyone is waiting to see what will happen.” The IDF said the evacuation order did not include nearby hospitals or medical facilities and that patients and medical staff did not need to leave."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6rzvyz9p6o,Israel and Hezbollah exchange heavy fire in major escalation,Hezbollah says it fired hundreds of rockets after Israel says it launched pre-emptive strikes on Sunday morning.,26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:41.705772,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has said it carried out a wave of pre-emptive strikes across southern Lebanon to thwart a large-scale rocket and drone attack by Hezbollah. Jets destroyed thousands of the Iran-backed armed group’s rocket launchers on Sunday morning, Israel's military said. Hezbollah and its Amal allies said three fighters had been killed. Hezbollah said it had still managed to fire 320 rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the assassination of a senior commander. According to Israel's military, one  Israeli navy soldier was killed. The US says it is working to avoid any further escalation after 10 months of hostilities that have raised fears of an all-out war. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. There was no breakthrough at the latest round of US-backed Gaza peace talks in Cairo.  Before leaving, Hamas said it rejected new Israeli conditions and accused Israel of backtracking on promises. Israel denies changing its demands since a last round of talks in early July. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group, which is also backed by Iran. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. Since October, more than 560 people have been reported killed according to Lebanon's health ministry, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, while 26 civilians and 23 soldiers have been killed in Israel, authorities report. The UN says almost 200,000 people have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Israel's attack on Hezbollah at around 04:30 (01:30 GMT) on Sunday was its biggest since the full-scale war between them in 2006. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 100 fighter jets had “struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels” in more than 40 areas of southern Lebanon. The strikes went ahead after ""extensive preparation"" for a large-scale aerial attack by Hezbollah was detected, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli aircraft had struck Beaufort Castle, the Bir Kalb area, and the outskirts of the towns of Ain Qana, Kfar Fila, Louaizeh, Bsalia, Kfar Melki, Sajd and Sarba. A resident of the town of Zibqeen said it had “felt like the apocalypse”. One person was killed in a drone strike on a car in Khiam, the Lebanese ministry of public health said. The Amal movement said one of its fighters from the village had been killed. The ministry also said an Israeli attack on the village of Tiri had killed two people. Hezbollah confirmed the deaths of two fighters from nearby Haris, without providing any details. ""What happened today is not the end of the story,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting. As well as destroying short-range rockets, Mr Netanyahu said, the IDF intercepted all of the drones which Hezbollah had “launched at a strategic target in the centre of the country”. “[Sheikh Hassan] Nasrallah in Beirut and [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north,” he warned the leaders of Hezbollah and Iran. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had told dozens of his counterparts worldwide that Israel did “not seek a full-scale war” but would “do whatever it takes to protect our citizens”. Not long after the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah said it had targeted and hit 11 Israeli military facilities in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights with more than 320 Katyusha rockets. It described the barrage as a response to the assassination of senior military commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on 30 July. The group said the operation had been “completed and accomplished” and it dismissed as ""empty"" Israel’s statements that its strikes on Sunday had thwarted a larger attack. Video footage showed explosions in the sky as incoming rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. Later, the IDF announced that an Israeli Navy soldier had fallen ""during combat in northern Israel"", without providing further details.  Israeli media say he was killed in an incident involving a Hezbollah drone and an Iron Dome interceptor in the vicinity of a Dvora patrol boat, about 4km from the Lebanese border. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address on Sunday evening that the group had targeted a military intelligence base about 110km (68 miles) into Israeli territory, which was only 1.5km (0.9 miles) away from Tel Aviv.  He said Hezbollah had been able to carry out its attack as planned, and all drones had been launched successfully, entering Israeli airspace, according to a Reuters translation.  He warned that the group would respond again if the results were deemed to be not enough.  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati - whose government has little influence over Hezbollah - said he was “holding a series of contacts with Lebanon’s friends to stop the escalation”. He called for a halt to the “Israeli aggression” and the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution which ended the 2006 war. Mr Mikati also emphasised Lebanon’s support for international efforts to broker a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the hope was that the latest fighting would not lead to a regional war.  The US sees an agreement as key to de-escalating tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border because Hezbollah has said it will only stop the hostilities once the fighting in Gaza ends."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wjx5ndnvdo,Tanker attacked by Houthis could be leaking oil - US,"The Greek-flagged MV Sounion is on fire after being attacked several times last week, the Pentagon says.",28 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:41.840987,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An oil tanker which was attacked by Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea last week is still on fire and may be leaking oil, the US Pentagon says. Attempts to salvage the Greek-owned and flagged MV Sounion have been thwarted by the Houthis, who have threatened more attacks, the Pentagon adds. The ship is carrying more than 150,000 tonnes - or one million barrels - of crude oil, and a major spill has the potential to be among the largest from a ship in recorded history. The Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of Yemen, say they have been attacking ships in the Red Sea for 10 months in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  They have reportedly sunk two ships and killed at least two crew members in that time. They have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. The Sounion was first hit by gunfire from two small boats last Wednesday, then struck by three unidentified projectiles, which sparked a fire and left it without engine power, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) office said. Its 25 crew members were rescued by a European warship a day later and transported to Djibouti. The oil tanker was later attacked again - the Houthis posted a video purportedly showing them setting it on fire. A US State Department statement on Saturday expressed concern about the attacks on the Sounion. It warned of a possible spill of oil four times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which released 257,000 barrels off the coast of Alaska. On Tuesday Pentagon spokesman Maj-Gen Patrick Ryder said two tugs had been sent to salvage the stricken vessel but the Houthis had threatened to attack them as well. He said the US was working with partners in the region to try to mitigate any potential environmental impact."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28d72948vo,Starmer's 'blame the Tories' strategy will not hold forever,The government’s message has focused on its challenging inheritance - but responsibility and blame will ultimately shift.,7 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:41.944804,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"New pet? Tick - the Starmers have a new kitten. Switching the No 10 décor?  Done - the PM had a portrait of Margaret Thatcher taken down. Cancelling the family holiday? That too, after riots spread in August. Kodak moments with other world leaders? The PM’s been to the White House and hosted a fancy international summit at a palace. In two months Sir Keir Starmer has already completed numerous rites of passage for new prime ministers. This weekend there will be another: his first major TV interview in No 10, which we’ll bring to you tomorrow on BBC One and iPlayer at 09:00 BST. But there’s one part of the job where there is an obvious, and deliberate, delay. Every Downing Street administration I’ve covered has been stunned at how fiercely No 10 gets the blame for almost all of the country’s ills. This government is trying to stave that off for as long as possible by shouting from the rooftops: “It’s not us, guv!” You shouldn’t be surprised. The clues were in the campaign, Chancellor Rachel Reeves repeating her mantra that, if victorious, Labour would receive the “worst economic inheritance since World War Two”. Since taking power, the government’s message has been relentlessly focused on what they say is the dire state of the economy, the dreadful state of our prisons. A big review of the NHS is due, so prepare to hear about the terrible condition of parts of the health service, too. They’ve been blaming the Tories as much as humanly possible. As one senior government source told me: “I'm prepared for people to get sick of hearing about the inheritance from the Tories.” And in case you didn’t feel a bit depressed already, in his first big speech of the new political season, Sir Keir told us things might get even worse. Prime miserable, as well as prime minister? There are good political reasons for being so overtly glum. It’s “where the public is”, another government insider explains, and has the advantage of being “broadly true” (more on that in a sec). It warns voters about hard decisions the government is about to make while hammering the concept of the “£22 billion black hole” in public finances into voters’ minds. Party strategists explain that this is a phase in a long-term political plan. First, shout about the wreckage and deliver the painful consequences they have chosen in the Budget next month. Next, early in 2025, start to talk more about benefits the government hopes to start delivering - those ”first steps” Sir Keir promised in May (remember them?). And then the hope - yes, of course they have thought this far - is that as the next general election approaches, they can prove the hard yards of 2024 and 2025 were worth it. That the country is improving, public services boosted, and you feel better off. Given that the Conservatives were in charge for 14 years, it is not just politically convenient for Labour to blame them for the country’s problems, but legitimate - to a great extent. Labour has not yet had 100 days in office, the Conservatives had nearly a decade and a half. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. But it’s also true that from the moment any government takes charge, their decisions matter. Part of the “£22 billion black hole” that Labour loves to mention is £9 billion public sector pay rises - above inflation - that it has decided to grant. Insiders are encouraged, telling me that the £22 billion number is starting to be repeated back to them in voter focus groups. But you can read more about exactly how they get to that total here. Then there is the first big political row of the autumn – new ministers’ decision to remove extra fuel bill help for most pensioners. It’s highly emotive to target the first cut at pensioners, and Downing Street would have been well aware that the decision to take away winter fuel allowance would cause an almighty row. Labour is trying to say their hand’s been forced because of the state of the books. But to govern is to choose. Unsurprisingly many of Labour’s own MPs are deeply anxious about the plan, which will be tested in Parliament this week. The question is, when the temperature drops in winter, will pensioners who lose out look at the thermostat and think, those blasted Tories? Or by then will they feel, instead, the government’s taken some of my cash away? It is only 65 days since Labour won the election. Sir Keir’s team doesn’t know for how long voters, en masse, are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt – or at least a measure of it. Those who work closely with the new PM say the job suits him far better than being leader of the opposition. He can now get things done, not merely criticise and judge. Yet his own personal ratings have fallen since taking the role he craved. Despite their huge majority, Labour has taken over when many voters are fed up with politicians. They never expected a jubilant welcome. Those close to Starmer believe they’d rather over-do the gloom in these early stages than create hopes among the public that are then dashed. Both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown saw a jump in approval ratings when they took the reins - before things started to go wrong. Keir Starmer’s team want to be able to tell their own story - that they inherited a broken economy, a broken country, and ultimately managed to turn it around - but politics doesn’t always follow a Downing Street script. His speech in Downing Street, then the Rose Garden moment a couple of weeks ago, the speech coming in a few weeks at the Labour's party conference, then the Budget - the short-term pain they're setting out may not find willing ears among the public. And those big set piece moments may be overshadowed by real-world events. The reflexes of those in charge when the unexpected happens often define governments more than carefully conceived strategies. It’s still a very new administration. For all the preparation they did before the election, the Labour top brass are now realising how quickly time passes when you're in power. One minute you’re exhausted from 18-hour days campaigning, the next moment you’re ushered into Downing Street and getting a bacon sandwich, a coffee, and a terrifying security briefing from the Civil Service. Power changes hands immediately. Responsibility and blame might transfer more gradually. But shift they will. This new government is working hard to link the problems of the country to Tory failures. But however loudly Labour protests about its genuinely challenging inheritance; however many times ministers point out, in evermore minute detail, what has gone wrong, the march of events moves irrevocably to a moment when blame or credit is for them.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2812pry0yo,"Salvage operation for oil tanker in Red Sea not safe, EU mission says",The ship carrying one million barrels of oil was abandoned after an attack by Yemen's Houthis.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:42.034553,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The European Union's naval mission in the Red Sea says private companies have called off attempts to salvage a burning oil tanker because the situation is unsafe. The Greek-owned and flagged MV Sounion, carrying about a million barrels of crude, was abandoned by its crew after it was hit by projectiles fired by Yemen’s Houthi movement on 21 August. Fighters later detonated explosives onboard, sparking several fires. Last Wednesday, the Houthis said they had agreed to allow the tanker to be towed away to avert an unprecedented environmental disaster. The EU mission, which was providing security to the tugs involved in the salvage operation, said “alternative solutions"" were being explored. On Monday, the mission reported that fires continued to burn on the tanker’s main deck. “The vessel remains anchored without drifting, and there are no visible signs of an oil spill,” it said. The United States has warned that a spill from the Sounion could be almost four times as large as the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989. That incident saw 2,100km (1,300 miles) of coastline contaminated after a tanker ran aground off Alaska. The Iran-backed Houthis have repeatedly targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November. They say they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. They have not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels or by US and British air strikes on territory they control in north-western Yemen. Israel also bombed Hudaydah’s port in July in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv. The Houthis attacked the Sounion two weeks ago with gunfire from small boats, before hitting it with three unidentified projectiles, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said at the time. Its 25 crew members were rescued by a European warship. The tanker was later attacked again, with footage released by the group last Thursday showing Houthi fighters boarding the ship and detonating at least six bombs simultaneously. The leader of the Houthis called the attack “brave and bold” in a recent address. The Houthis have continued to attack oil tankers in the Red Sea in recent days. On Monday, the US military’s Central Command said the Panama-owned and flagged MV Blue Lagoon I and the Saudi-owned and flagged MV Amjad were hit by two ballistic missiles and a one-way attack drone. The Amjad is carrying approximately two million barrels of oil – almost twice the amount on the Sounion. “These reckless acts of terrorism by the Houthis continue to destabilize regional and global commerce, as well as put the lives of civilian mariners and maritime ecosystems at risk,” Central Command said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7854g3gz0eo,Israel-Gaza ceasefire: Is a deal still possible?,"As Benjamin Netanyahu rises in Israeli opinion polls, his US allies fear he is blocking a ceasefire deal.",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.064473,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Earlier this week, on live television, the mother of one of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza made an offer to the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar: Release all 109 hostages – dead and alive - in exchange for the children of Israel’s security chiefs. But Ditza Or, whose son Avinatan was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during the 7 October attacks, wasn’t pushing for Israel’s leaders to sign a ceasefire deal - she was pushing them to fight Hamas harder. Ms Or, and a handful of other pro-war hostage families, are unlikely allies of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now under immense pressure from his US ally, his security chiefs and even his own defence minister to be more flexible and reach a deal. Leaked reports of a recent phone call with his most important ally suggested that US President Joe Biden told the Israeli leader at one point to “stop bullshitting” him. The implication: that Mr Netanyahu didn’t want a deal at all. As negotiations limped on in Cairo this week, aimed at bridging the gaps between Israel and Hamas, leaks to Israeli media suggest that the gaps between Mr Netanyahu and his own negotiators and defence chiefs are getting wider. According to Dana Weiss, chief political analyst for Israel’s TV Channel 12, the prime minister privately accused key negotiators and security chiefs of “weakness”, presenting himself as standing alone in defence of Israel’s security interests. They have different approaches to the urgency of a deal, she says, and one reason for that is the differing level of responsibility each feels. “The military establishment feel guilty about 7 October, and feel a moral duty to bring back the hostages,” she explained.  “Our government, our ministers and especially Prime Minister Netanyahu don’t feel personally responsible for 7 October, they put the blame totally on the military establishment, and therefore do not feel that same sense of urgency to go ahead with a deal.” Mr Netanyahu has said that getting the hostages home is his second priority in the war - behind victory over Hamas, and has emphasised his commitment to preserve Israel’s security “in the face of major domestic and foreign pressure”. The man who once cherished his image as Israel’s ‘Mr Security’ appears to be playing to it again, 10 months after that image was shattered by the 7 October attacks. A key sticking point in negotiations is whether Israeli forces withdraw from a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. Mr Netanyahu appears to be sticking hard to a ""red line"" of keeping an Israeli military presence there, citing Israel’s security needs, despite leaks suggesting that his negotiators believe it is a “deal-breaker”. Senior Hamas figure Hussam Badran told the BBC on Friday that the group would accept nothing less than the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and that Mr Netanyahu’s position showed that he did not want an agreement, but was “manipulat[ing] through empty rounds of negotiations to gain time”. Hamas is widely seen as facing tough questions over what Gaza or the Palestinians have gained from the October attacks, after more than 10 months of bombing and displacement.  Compromises on prisoner exchanges are seen as easier for the group to swallow than accepting the continued presence of Israel’s army in Gaza, and checkpoints for residents moving north. Egypt is also understood to be refusing any deal that does not have Palestinians in charge on the other side of their shared border. Hamas has not formally joined the current round of talks, and many believe Mr Sinwar’s own priority is keeping the Gaza War going in order to spark a regional conflict, which would put enormous pressure on Israel, and - the reasoning goes -force its prime minister into greater concessions to end it. The risks of a wider escalation – amid threats from Iran and Hezbollah – are one reason Washington is pressing hard for a deal. The US is three months away from a presidential election, and President Biden’s administration believes a ceasefire in Gaza would help calm the region. The political analyst, Dana Weiss, says that Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant  agrees that if Israel does not take the path of a ceasefire deal - even temporarily - then it will be on a sure path to escalation. “For the prime minister, it’s totally the opposite,” she says. “He answers: No, if we go ahead and cave to Sinwar now, Hezbollah and Iran see that we’re weak. We have to finish the task with Hamas, to prevent the war.” But, she says, Mr Netanyahu also has domestic political incentives to stall the negotiations.  Among those incentives is the fact that, after months of abysmal approval ratings, he is now rising again in opinion polls. Several surveys have recently placed him at the top of respondents’ voting intentions, both in terms of his right-wing party, Likud, and his own personal profile as leader - results that were unthinkable a few months ago. All eyes are now on the next scheduled talks, due to take place on Sunday. In the meantime, Egypt has reportedly agreed to share Israel’s latest proposal for the border area with Hamas. Mediators insist a deal is still possible, but hopes on all sides appear to be shrinking. After meeting the Israeli prime minister today, Ella Ben Ami, the daughter of another Israeli hostage, said she looked Benjamin Netanyahu in the eye and asked him to promise to do everything and not give up until they return.  She was left, she said, with “a heavy and difficult feeling that this isn’t going to happen soon”. The clock is ticking on these negotiations: for Gaza’s people, for the Israeli hostages still held there in tunnels, for the region as a whole.   But for Mr Sinwar and Mr Netanyahu, perhaps the most powerful weapon they have in this war is time."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjvel0pynqo,Why is the Pope doing a long tour when he's so frail?,His packed trip to Asia involves three countries in which Catholics are a minority.,8 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.173316,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Pope Francis, who has often appeared to revel in confounding and surprising others, is at it again. Many times over the years, he has seemed to suggest he is slowing down, only to ramp up his activities again. At nearly 88 years old, he has a knee ailment that impairs mobility, abdominal problems caused by diverticulitis and is vulnerable to respiratory issues owing to the removal of most of one of his lungs. Last autumn, the Pope said his health problems meant that foreign travel had become difficult. Soon after, when he cancelled a trip to the UAE, it led to heightened speculation about the extent of his medical difficulties. But that was then. Now, he is in the middle of the longest foreign visit of his 11-and-a-half year papacy. It has been one packed with engagements, and as well as Timor-Leste it involves three countries – Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Singapore – in which Catholics are a minority. So why is the Pope travelling so extensively and so far from home? His supporters say his passion drives him. “He obviously has an enormous amount of stamina and that is driven by his absolute passion for mission,” says Father Anthony Chantry, the UK director of the Pope’s mission charity Missio, who has just been appointed to the Vatican administration’s evangelisation department. “He talks about all of us having a tireless mission to reach out to others, to set an example.” Christian “mission” is something that has evolved over the centuries. It is still about spreading the gospel but now the stated aim is focused on social justice and charitable endeavours. Throughout his trip Pope Francis will meet missionaries, including a group from Argentina now based in Papua New Guinea. But on numerous trips around Asia including this one, he also skirts close to China, a country with deep suspicions about the Church, its mission and its motives. The Pope has frequently emphasised the importance of evangelisation for every Catholic. Yet in many parts of the world, it is still hard to separate ideas of “missionaries” and “evangelisation” from notions of European colonisation. As the number of Catholics in Europe declines, is “mission” and “evangelising” in Asia and Africa now about Church expansion in those parts of the world? “I think what he is preaching is the Gospel of love that will do no one any harm. He's not trying to drum up support for the Church, that's not what evangelisation is about,” says Father Anthony. “It isn't to be equated with proselytising, that is not what we have done for a long time. That is not the agenda of the Holy Father and not the agenda of the Church. What we do is we share and we help people in any way we can, regardless of their faith or not having any faith.” Father Anthony says being a Christian missionary in the modern day, for which Pope Francis is setting an example, is about doing good work and listening, but sometimes, “where necessary”, also challenging ideas. “We believe God will do the rest, and if that leads to people accepting Jesus Christ, that's great. And if it helps people to appreciate their own spirituality – their own culture – more, then I think that is another success.” Certainly the Pope has long talked of interfaith harmony and respect for other faiths. One of the most enduring images of his current trip will be his kissing the hand of the Grand Imam of the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta and holding it to his cheek. He was warmly welcomed by people coming out to see him in the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world. Pope and top Indonesian imam make joint call for peace Pope Francis will end his marathon trip in Singapore, a country where around three-quarters of the population is ethnic Chinese, but also where the Catholic minority is heavily involved in missionary work in poorer areas. For centuries now, Singapore has been something of a strategic regional hub for the Catholic Church, and what Pope Francis says and does there is likely to be closely watched in China, not least by the Catholics living there. It is hard to get a true picture of numbers, but estimates suggest around 12 million. The lack of clarity over numbers is partly because China’s Catholics have been split between the official Catholic Church in China and an underground church loyal to the Vatican that evolved under communism. In trying to unite the two groups, Pope Francis has been accused of appeasing Beijing and letting down Catholics in the underground movement who had not accepted the Chinese government’s interference, and who face the continued threat of persecution. Deals struck between the Vatican and Beijing in recent years appear to have left a situation where the Chinese government appoints Catholic bishops, and the Pope gives in and recognises them. China says it’s a matter of sovereignty, while Pope Francis insists he has the final say – though that is not the way it has looked. “He won't be pleasing everyone all the time, but I think what the Holy Father really wants to indicate is that the Church is not a threat to the state,” says Father Anthony Chantry. “He is treading a very careful path and it's fraught with difficulties, but I think what he's trying to do is just to build up a respectful relationship with the government in China.” Rightly or wrongly, it is all in the name of bringing more people into the fold. Some of Pope Francis’ predecessors have been more uncompromising in many ways, seeming to be more accepting of a smaller, “purer” global Catholic community, rather than make concessions in either foreign relations or in the way the Church views, for example, divorce or homosexuality. While some popes have also clearly been more comfortable in study and theology than travel and being surrounded by huge crowds, some have leaned into the politics of their position. It is very clear when travelling with Pope Francis that while he can often look tired and subdued during diplomatic events, he is quickly rejuvenated by the masses who come out to see him, and energised by the non-dignitaries he meets, particularly young people. This is certainly not a pope who shuns the limelight – it is being among people, some would say mission, that appears to be his lifeblood. Father Anthony Chantry says this latest, longest papal trip is just a continued display of how the Pope feels the Church should engage with both Catholics and non-Catholics. “The whole thrust is that we have got to reach out to others. We have to make everyone feel welcome. I think he (Pope Francis) does that really well, but I don't think he's trying to score any points there, it's just him.” There is very little the Pope has done since his election in 2013 that has not rankled Catholic traditionalists, who often feel that his spirit of outreach is taken too far. His actions on this trip are unlikely to change that. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24p2l11y12o,Corbyn forms new group with four pro-Gaza MPs,The Independent Alliance hopes to gain greater influences becoming the fifth-largest Commons group.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.273177,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Jeremy Corbyn has united with four other MPs elected as independents to establish the joint-fifth biggest group in the House of Commons. Already outnumbering the Green Party and matching the number of Reform UK MPs, the new Independent Alliance has made a pitch to recruit more members after seven of Mr Corbyn's allies were suspended from the parliamentary Labour Party.  All five of the group beat Labour candidates in July's election with their pro-Palestinian stance in constituencies with large Muslim populations. The Independent Alliance say they will use their new platform to campaign for scrapping the two-child benefit limit and against arms sales to Israel. The Independent Alliance includes five of the six independent MPs elected at the 2024 general election - the most in modern history. Alongside Mr Corbyn the group comprises of Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed. Alex Easton, a former member of the Democratic Unionist Party DUP who was elected as independent MP for North Down, is not part of the group. Established parties of five MPs have previously been eligible for as much as £129,000 in ""short money"" - public funds given to opposition parties to support research. However, Parliament's rules currently appear to prevent these funds going to new groups formed between general elections. But by collaborating the independents can secure more funds for their campaign work by sharing resources and hosting joint fundraisers. The group also hopes to gain the opportunity to choose debate topics and be allocated more questions in Parliament. Given Labour's huge majority it is unclear how effective a force the independents will be in Parliament. But the group have already been working together informally for months, calling for the two-child benefit cap to be scrapped, alongside Green and SNP MPs.  One of their first actions was to reach out to the seven Labour MPs - all former allies of Mr Corbyn including his former shadow chancellor John McDonnell - who were suspended from the parliamentary party for six months after voting in favour of a abolishing the cap. So far, there has been no formal coordination between independent MPs and suspended Labour MPs, the BBC understands. In a joint statement the Independent Alliance said: ""Already, this government has scrapped the winter fuel allowance for around 10 million pensioners, voted to keep the two-child benefits cap, and ignored calls to end arms sales to Israel. ""Millions of people are crying out for a real alternative to austerity, inequality and war – and their voices deserve to be heard. ""As individuals we were voted by our constituents to represent their concerns in Parliament on these matters, and more, and we believe that as a collective group we can carry on doing this with greater effect. ""The more MPs who are prepared to stand up for these principles, the better. “Our door is always open to other MPs who believe in a more equal and peaceful world."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rxn80d6mvo,A tent city next to Mayfair: Why cutting homelessness might be harder than before,"Governments have tackled the problem in the past, but will doing so prove more difficult today?",9 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.368168,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"On a recent evening, on one of London’s most exclusive roads, an estate agent was selling a property for £16.5m. Outside the agency, on the other side of Park Lane, was an encampment of approximately 24 tents housing rough sleepers. Some were sitting outside, taking in the warm night air. Others were reading by torchlight. Rough sleeping is on the rise across England but the tents like these increasingly appearing in the country’s towns and cities are only the most visible signs of a much bigger problem. Homelessness is, by some measures, at record levels. Over 150,000 children, for instance, are living in temporary accommodation, often miles from their schools and their friends. On occasion, some are forced to live with their entire family in one cramped, sometimes mouldy, room. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner says England is in the “middle of the worst housing crisis in living memory”. To tackle this, the new government is proposing to set up a homelessness reduction unit and in its manifesto, Labour said it would “put Britain back on track to ending homelessness”. This might sound ambitious, but homelessness is something that governments have successfully tackled previously.  In 1999, Tony Blair committed to reducing the number of rough sleepers by two-thirds in three years. By 2002, his government declared it had achieved its target a year early - the number of rough sleepers in England had fallen from 1,850 to 532. These numbers remained low for most of the remainder of the decade. The method the government uses to count rough sleeping has changed over the years but experts agree that rough sleeping fell under Labour. In 2010, when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition took office, the figures showed an 11-year low of 440 rough sleepers on any given night. However the then-Housing Minister Grant Shapps said he was “sceptical” that the figures reflected “the true situation on the streets” and so the counting method was revised. Under the new methodology, the number of rough sleepers in England stood at 1,768 in 2010. After that the numbers rose, peaking in 2017. Now, the latest official figures put it at 3,898 - 120% higher than in 2010. Even during the pandemic, when the Conservatives pursued an “Everyone In” effort to protect rough sleepers from Covid - often using hotels that couldn’t accept paying guests - the number of people sleeping outside never fell below 2,400. The evidence of the Blair years gives Labour the confidence, however, to say it knows how to cut homelessness. But repeating the trick in 2024 may not be as easy as it was before. And most experts believe the latest figure is a huge underestimate. The annual snapshot, which counts the number of people found to be rough sleeping on a single night each autumn, was found by the UK Statistics Authority to fall short in “trustworthiness, quality, and value”. It doesn’t include, for instance, a person known to be a rough sleeper, but not visible on the night of the count. And it’s not just the numbers that are greater today - the type of rough sleeper is different, too. The occupants of the tents on Park Lane were mostly Romanians. Indeed in London, for which the data is most detailed and up-to-date, 55% of rough sleepers are not from the UK. Back in the 1990s, rough sleepers in London were predominantly British and Irish. One obvious solution today would be to help those people from abroad return home. But while such reconnecting schemes do exist, it isn’t that simple, says Matt Downie, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis. He says that some are victims of modern slavery, others have the right to remain in the UK. “It needs untangling – they’re not all professional rough sleepers,” Mr Downie says. Relying on the private rented sector, as councils usually do to tackle homelessness, is becoming increasingly difficult, too. While Labour points out its commitment to ending so-called “no-fault evictions”, private rents in some areas have soared in recent years - up 9.7% in London in the year to June 2024, and 8.6% across England. In addition, the short-term rental market, such as Airbnb, has reduced the number of properties that councils can use. London, for instance, is reportedly the city with the most Airbnb listings in the world, totalling over 150,000 - out of more than half a million across the UK. As a result, the cost of housing families in temporary accommodation has soared. Councils spent more than £1bn on it last year, and the problem is pushing some local authorities towards bankruptcy. Several councils were forced to enter into expensive deals with the last Conservative government to cover the soaring costs of homelessness. Treasury rules mean that Whitehall will only reimburse local authorities 90% of a figure calculated in 2011 for the cost of temporary accommodation, leading to an average monthly shortfall of about £350 per household, according to Mr Downie. All this means the Starmer government will face a more difficult and more expensive task than its predecessor in the 1990s and 2000s. There are, however, lessons the new ministers can take from the last Labour government, according to those who were there. The key to the Blair administration’s success was getting the prime minister’s name and influence attached to the target, says Ian Brady, who was deputy director of the Rough Sleepers Unit at the time. Tony Blair, he said, would hold regular meetings with key ministers to see what progress was being made, “banging heads together if necessary”. There was money behind the initiative - £250m over three years - recalls Mr Brady, “a relatively big budget”. And different government departments were forced to help achieve this goal, including the Home Office and the Department of Health. After that, a three-pronged strategy was adopted. Officials gathered data to understand who was sleeping rough. Those already in homeless accommodation, such as hostels, were moved into the private rented sector - allowing others to come off the streets. And lots of support services, such as drug and alcohol treatment, were put in place to ensure people did not become homeless again. There are potential lessons from the Conservatives’ term in office, too. In 2018, they funded three pilot studies of a scheme that has proven successful in tackling rough sleeping in the United States and Europe and had already been introduced in Scotland. Housing First moves rough sleepers straight into their own properties and provides support services to help them maintain their homes. Tenancies can be kept, for instance, even if someone receives a short prison sentence or struggles to maintain contact with their drug and alcohol team. The pilots were deemed to have been a success, with an official analysis concluding that “the vast majority of clients were in long-term accommodation a year after entering Housing First and reported significantly better outcomes across a range of measures”. But the government has not said if it will introduce the scheme across the country, with some experts worried that it does not help enough people for the cost of the programme. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in the city by 2030. He has not laid out the full details yet, but has promised that council house building will be a key plank – since 2018, says Mr Khan, London has built more than twice as many council homes as the rest of England combined. Despite that, London has the biggest homelessness problem in England. The Conservative government, in 2019, made a similar commitment to end rough sleeping by the end of the last Parliament but failed to achieve it, despite spending over £500m tackling the problem between 2022 and 2025. In any case, rough sleeping is not the most significant homelessness issue. The latest figures from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government showed there were almost 120,000 households living in temporary accommodation - a record high - including those 150,000 children. More than 3,200 children were living in bed and breakfast accommodation for longer than the legal limit of six weeks, a figure that is up by almost 2,000% since the last time Labour were in power. “It’s a national disgrace,” says Ian Brady. “I wouldn’t neglect what’s happening on the streets, but I’d start by tackling that problem.” An expert, who has the ear of the new government, said one approach would be to keep those women and children who are fleeing domestic violence in their homes and force their partners to move out by using a different policing approach. Finding properties for those families who do end up homeless will not be easy, however. The 1.5m homes the government has committed to building during the lifetime of this Parliament will take some time to appear, yet the homeless problem is both immediate and urgent. In an effort to tackle the limited supply of social housing, the government is expected to hold a consultation on the future of Right to Buy, the scheme that allows council tenants to buy their homes, often at a significant discount. Matt Downie from Crisis would go further. “I would immediately suspend Right to Buy. It’s been a disaster,” he says. Since the policy was introduced in 1980, of the almost two million homes that have been sold through Right to Buy, Shelter estimates that just 4% have been replaced. However even if Right to Buy were to be ended entirely, some commentators say annual sales only represent a small proportion of social housing stock and further action would still be needed to tackle the shortage of social housing. Mr Downie would also urge the government to align the allocations system for social housing in England with what happens in Scotland, so that homeless families get priority when properties become available. One lesson that remains from the Blair years, say experts, is the need to ensure that all government departments are working towards the same aim. The Ministry of Justice often releases prisoners into the community knowing they have nowhere to live while the Home Office has been evicting asylum seekers from their accommodation within days of giving them permission to remain in the UK, often onto the streets. Ms Rayner has promised “a long-term strategy across Government to deal with every pressure – including increasing social and affordable housing, and providing support for refugees leaving the asylum system and prison leavers”. Such an approach, she says, “will get us back on track towards ending homelessness for good”. The challenge the new government faces in tackling homelessness is much greater than the last time Labour were in office. But the potential rewards are also even greater, not just in terms of saving money but in giving so many thousands of families the dignity and certainty that comes with having a place to call home.

According to the UN, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory’s wastewater in June. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he is ""gravely concerned"" and confirmed that efforts are under way to roll out a vaccination programme in the coming weeks. The 10-month-old, who was unvaccinated, is said to be in a stable condition after developing paralysis in one leg. Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause disfigurement and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five. Humanitarian groups have blamed the re-emergence of polio in Gaza on disruption to child vaccination programmes and massive damage to water and sanitation systems caused by the war. In order to try to contain the spread, the UN has been pressing for a week-long pause in fighting to carry out a polio vaccination campaign for more than 640,000 children under the age of 10. UN Secretary General António Guterres said ""hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza [are] at risk"". He said that for the campaign to be successful, transport of vaccines and required equipment would need to be facilitated, as well as the entry of polio experts into Gaza. Adequate fuel, increased flow of cash, reliable communications and the ensured safety of both health workers and people reaching health facilities were also needed, he said. WHO has approved the release of 1.6 million doses of vaccine, UNICEF is coordinating their delivery along with cold storage units and UNRWA’s medical teams will administer the vaccines once they arrive in Gaza. UNICEF’s Executive Director Catherine Russel said that the re-emergence of the virus in the strip after 25 years is ""another sobering reminder of how chaotic, desperate and dangerous the situation has become"". On 18 August, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said since the beginning of the war, 282,126 vials of the polio vaccine, sufficient for 2,821,260 doses, have been sent to Gaza. It said in the coming weeks, an additional 60,000 vaccines will be delivered to vaccinate over one million children. According to the IDF,  entry to the Gaza Strip for vaccines and epidemic prevention is being facilitated by the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), ""This includes the entry of medical teams and vaccines against the polio virus,"" the IDF said. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,265 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and combatant deaths. The UN human rights office says most of those killed were women and children."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze5r4e66ydo,Biden tells Netanyahu Gaza ceasefire deal is urgent,The US president stresses to Israel's PM the importance of removing “any remaining obstacles”.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.538774,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden has “stressed the urgency” of reaching a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House has said. In a call on Wednesday, which was also joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr Biden is said to have stated the importance of removing “any remaining obstacles” blocking an agreement with Hamas. He also reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to help defend Israel against what the White House called ""all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis"". It came after the US secretary of state wrapped up a diplomatic tour of the Middle East, pushing for a deal that could end the war. The office of Mr Netanyahu reiterated on Wednesday that Israel planned to keep troops in a strip of land along the border between Gaza and Egypt - known as the Philadelphi Corridor - in the event of any such deal.  “Israel will insist on the achievement of all of its objectives for the war, as they have been defined by the security cabinet, including that Gaza never again constitutes a security threat to Israel. This requires securing the southern border,” a statement said. The issue has become a key sticking point - with Hamas so far insisting on a total withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Egypt also opposes the presence of Israeli troops along its border with Gaza. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel had agreed to a “US bridging proposal”, after a three-hour meeting with Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Mr Blinken would not confirm to the BBC whether the US proposal stipulated the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Philadelphi corridor, but Mr Netanyahu’s repeated public insistence on the plan appears to have irritated Washington. A US official accused the prime minister of making “maximalist statements” that were “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line”. A new round of ceasefire talks is set to take place in Cairo this weekend, with US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari representatives in attendance. Hamas has so far not said they will attend, but it is believed they are continuing to receive updates on the negotiations from Egyptian and Qatari mediators.  A member of the Hamas political bureau told the BBC on Monday that the group had “agreed a deal [through mediators] on 2 July” and therefore “don't need a new round of negotiations or to discuss the new demands of Benjamin Netanyahu”. “We have shown maximum flexibility and positivity,” Basem Naim said. He claimed that Mr Netanyahu was “not interested in reaching a ceasefire, only in flaring up the region... and serving his own personal political interests"". In Gaza on Wednesday, at least 50 Palestinians were killed by Israeli air strikes, Hamas-run health authorities said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit around 30 targets across the territory, including tunnels, launch sites and an observation post. The targets included the UN-run Salah al-Din school in Gaza City, which the IDF said was used by “Hamas operatives” as a “hideout”. The strike killed at least four people and wounded 15, the Hamas-run Civil Defence service said. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, said that children were killed in the strike and some were “burnt to death"". ""Gaza is no place for children anymore. They are the first casualty of this merciless war,"" he said, adding that “a ceasefire is beyond overdue"". Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,223 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and combatant deaths. The UN human rights office says most of those killed were women and children. Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement also exchanged fire on Wednesday, with Israel saying it hit a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the Bekaa Valley overnight. The Lebanese health ministry said one person was killed and 30 others injured. In response, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said it targeted Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights with a rocket barrage. Israeli authorities said two homes were hit and one person was injured."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14zgv18l55o,Hezbollah rockets hit Golan Heights after Israel strikes deep in Lebanon,Fears are growing that the cross-border hostilities could escalate into an all-out war.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.720938,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hezbollah has launched dozens of rockets at the occupied Golan Heights after Israeli aircraft struck deep inside Lebanon, as fears of an all-out war grow. The Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in the Bekaa Valley overnight. The Lebanese health ministry said one person was killed and 30 others injured. In response, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said it targeted Israeli military positions in the Golan with a rocket barrage. Israeli authorities said two homes were hit and one person was injured. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Fatah movement accused Israel of assassinating a senior member of its armed wing in Lebanon in an effort to ignite a regional conflict. The Israeli military said it had killed Khalil al-Makdah in a strike in the southern port city of Sidon because he was operating on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and was involved in directing attacks in and smuggling weapons to the occupied West Bank. It was reportedly the first strike on a Fatah member since the start of the Gaza war, which has led to escalating cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. Tensions have risen in recent weeks after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut, who it blamed for the killing of 12 children in a rocket attack. So far, more than 530 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, among them at least 130 civilians, and 49 people in Israel, including 26 civilians. Almost 200,000 people have also been displaced on both sides of the border. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on Tuesday that the military’s “centre of gravity” was gradually shifting from Gaza and to the Lebanese border. “Attacking munitions warehouses in Lebanon is preparation for anything that might happen,” he noted. On Wednesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that jets had struck overnight a number of Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in the northern Bekaa Valley - a stronghold of the group - as well as a compound used by an air defence system. The IDF also said it had targeted a Hezbollah fighter in the southern border village of Beit Lif. Lebanon’s health ministry said the strikes in the Bekaa region had killed one person, whom was not identified, and that nine children had been among the 30 injured. The state-run National News Agency (NNA) said the strikes had targeted the outskirts of the town of Bodai, the area between Saraain and Safri, and Nabi Chit. The health ministry also reported that a man had been killed in Beit Lif, while Hezbollah confirmed the death of a fighter from the village called Hussein Mostafa. In response to the strikes, Hezbollah said it had launched a barrage of rockets towards an IDF logistics base in the Golan Heights. The IDF said about 50 projectiles had been launched from Lebanon and that some had fallen in the settlement of Katzrin. A 30-year-old man was moderately wounded by shrapnel when a rocket hit his home and set it on fire, according to the Magen David Adom ambulance service. The deputy commander of the IDF’s Northern Command, Brigadier General Alon Friedman, accused Hezbollah of directly targeting the 8,000 civilians living in Katzrin. Hezbollah also said it had carried out a separate drone attack on Israeli military bases and warehouses in Amiad, a kibbutz near the Sea of Galilee. The IDF said some of the drones had come down in the area, without causing any casualties. Later on Wednesday, an Israeli drone strike killed Fatah's Khalil al-Makdah as he drove a 4x4 vehicle through Sidon’s Villas area, according to NNA. Fatah’s armed wing, the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades - whose Lebanese branch is headed by his brother, Mounir - later confirmed his death and described him as “one of the leaders of the military council in the West Bank”. Tawfiq Tirawy, a member of Fatah’s Central Committee based in Ramallah, told AFP news agency that the ""assassination of a Fatah official is further proof that Israel wants to ignite a full-scale war in the region”. When asked about the comments at a briefing, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the IDF had “produced a comprehensive list of [Makdah’s] crimes”. A joint statement from the IDF and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) alleged that Khalil and Mounir al-Makdah collaborated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and were “involved in the direction of terror attacks as well as the smuggling of weapons and funds designated for terrorist activities” into the West Bank. “The IDF and ISA will constantly continue to take action to monitor and thwart activity that endangers the safety of the State of Israel and its citizens, in order to expose and impair Iranian attempts to carry out terrorist activity,” they added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq827855x5vo,Brother of Hamas victim accuses SNP of double standards on Israel,"Colin Cowan said the SNP displayed ""double standards"" in the fallout of Angus Robertson's meeting with an Israeli diplomat.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.800228,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The brother of a British-Israeli man killed by Hamas has accused the SNP of double standards in its stance on Israel.  Bernard Cowan, originally from Glasgow, was killed by Hamas gunmen in his home on a kibbutz in Southern Israel during the 7 October attack. The 57-year-old left his family in Scotland when he was just 19 to move to Israel. Then first minister Humza Yousaf was widely praised after he embraced Mr Cowan's grieving mother during a visit to Giffnock Newton Mearns Synagogue in East Renfrewshire a few days after his death.   Mr Cowan's brother, Colin Cowan, said he now believed Mr Yousaf had merely used the meeting with his mother as a photo opportunity and questioned how sincere he has been in his comments at the time. He also said he had been angered by criticism of External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson, who apologised after meeting an Israeli diplomat earlier this month.  Mr Cowan said Scottish Jews wanted First Minister John Swinney to acknowledge the “legitimate fears” of the community and to meet them. An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism, and the first minister said he would be grateful for the opportunity to meet Mr Cowan and his family. Mr Robertson was heavily criticised by several senior members of his own party - including former SNP ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - after he met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK Daniela Grudsky on 8 August. Mr Robertson subsequently said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire.  He said the Scottish government would not accept further invitations to meet Israeli diplomats until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace and humanitarian assistance, and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"". The SNP also withdrew the party whip from MSP John Mason over social media posts in which he questioned whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. That equates to about 1.7% of the 2.3 million population of the territory, with satellite image analysis suggesting nearly 60% of buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war. Mr Cowan said he believed Israel was being ""targeted"" as the Scottish government had met with representatives from other countries with ""terrible civil rights"" such as Turkey. ""Israel is the only Jewish state in the world,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""The definition of antisemitism is prejudice against Jewish people. ""So if the Scottish government aren’t willing to talk to Israel, is that not being prejudiced against Jewish people? ""Why is it that Israel is being targeted when every other Western country is quite happy to talk to Israel? If you want a balanced, impartial view, you should meet with both sides."" Speaking at the service on 12 October at the Giffnock Newton Mearns Synogogue at which he met Mr Cowan's mother, Mr Yousaf said he stood in solidarity with Scotland’s Jewish community. He added: ""I want you to know that this first minister, who is proudly Muslim, shares the pain of our Jewish communities. ""Your heartbreak is my heartbreak. Your loss is my loss. Your tears are my tears."" Mr Yousaf has been a vocal critic of the Israeli military action in Gaza, which says has gone ""way beyond a legitimate response"" and has been ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"".  Mr Cowan said he now believed Mr Yousaf had used the service at the synogogue as a ""photo opportunity"" and questioned how genuine he had been. “At the time, it seemed quite genuine,"" he said. ""But some of what he said recently, it doesn't seem so genuine anymore. It seems a bit biased, what he did at the time.” Mr Yousaf said his thoughts were with all of the families impacted by the 7 October attack, as well as families in Gaza ""who have been devastated by Israel’s horrendous actions"". He said: “When I participated in the service of solidarity at Giffnock Shul in October last year, it was at a time of extreme personal grief as my in-laws continued to be trapped in a warzone in Gaza, not knowing whether they would live or die day-by-day.  ""My commitment to the Jewish community then, and now, is to be an ally in the face of antisemitism, and I am proud of my lifelong campaigning against hatred in all of its forms, and believe that Islamaphobia and antisemitism are two sides of the same coin."" But he said that criticism of the actions of the government of Israel was not antisemitism. “While I support diplomacy, even with countries we fundamentally disagree with, there must be limits,"" he said. ""That is why I support the Scottish government ensuring there are not normal diplomatic relationships with the government of Israel until they comply with their international obligations and cease killing civilians with impunity.” Mr Cowan said he had noticed a spike in antisemitism since the escalation between Israel and Gaza following the 7 October attacks.  ""I’ve never felt so unsafe in Scotland as I have in the last year,"" he said.  ""Walking down the street, would I be targeted if they knew I was Jewish? It’s definitely an unsafe feeling at the moment. ""There have been numerous incidents of buildings being attacked, people being attacked since 7 October. The Palestinian support that we see, the protests on a weekly basis, makes us feel unsafe."" He told BBC Scotland that his relatives living in Israel had been displaced amid the ongoing violence.  ""They’re not living in their home, they’re living somewhere else,"" he said.  ""They are distraught. They’ve lost a father, husband, grandfather, we’ve lost a brother, my mum’s lost a son. It’s hard.  ""It’s not easy when someone so young is taken. We’re still reeling from it.” An SNP spokesperson said the party stood ""entirely against"" antisemitism. They said: ""Following last year’s horrific attacks by Hamas, SNP policy has been consistent and clear that hostages must be released, an immediate ceasefire must be put in place and that a viable Palestine state must be recognised within a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live alongside each other in peace.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39kwmm3x94o,Will more stars boycott Dubai after rapper Macklemore?,"The United Arab Emirates is accused of having links to a paramilitary group, in Sudan, suspected of genocide.",2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:49.882238,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"When fans saw rapper Macklemore had cancelled an upcoming gig, some of them assumed it was in solidarity with Gaza. But it wasn't. The gig was in Dubai and he had cancelled over the war in Sudan, which has already killed tens of thousands of people, left millions more hungry and triggered a humanitarian disaster. The glamorous Gulf city of Dubai is the biggest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - which has been widely accused of funding the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), one of the warring sides in Sudan. “The crisis in Sudan is catastrophic,” Macklemore said in an Instagram post on Monday. Some food security specialists estimate up to 2.5 million people could die of starvation and illness by October. “I have to ask myself what is my intention as an artist?” continued the rapper, who rose to fame with 2012 classic Thrift Shop. “If I take the money, while knowing it doesn't sit right with my spirit, how am I any different from the politicians I've been actively protesting against?” His moral stand has thrust the brutal conflict - which has garnered far less global attention than Ukraine or Gaza - into popular culture, and activists hope other artists will follow suit. “It was huge,” says an activist who has been campaigning for a ceasefire with the group London for Sudan. “In the comments there were a lot of people saying, ‘oh, my God, what's happening in Sudan?’ “I think it opened people's eyes.” The RSF is battling the Sudanese army for control of the country and has been accused of sexual violence, looting and ethnic cleansing in areas it controls. A Human Rights Watch report suggests the RSF may have committed genocide against non-Arabs in a city where 15,000 people are feared to have been killed, something the group denies. The RSF traces its roots to a militia, known as the Janjaweed, which were also accused of genocide 20 years ago in Sudan - an estimated 300,000 people died back then. Evidence tying the UAE to the RSF has been mounting. During the war it emerged that the RSF had used drones which a weapons expert from Amnesty International described as the “same drones” the UAE had supplied to its allies in other conflicts, including in Ethiopia and Yemen. Experts have also seen civilian aircraft allegedly transporting weapons from the UAE to the RSF, according to a UN report presented to the Security Council earlier this year. The allegation is that the UAE is trying to gain an economic foothold in the Red Sea and profit from Sudan’s resources. The RSF controls some of Sudan’s most lucrative gold mines, located in the Darfur region.  A Swiss aid organisation alleges the Emiratis are importing billions of dollars worth of the precious metal that are smuggled out of Africa, including Sudan. And before widespread fighting broke out in the country last year, the UAE signed a deal worth $6 billion to build and operate a port, airport and economic zone on the country’s Red Sea coast. The UAE government has described the allegations over its involvement in the Sudan conflict as ""baseless and unfounded"", and meant ""to divert attention from the ongoing fighting and humanitarian catastrophe"". ""UAE reiterates its call for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. The warring parties must stop fighting and work towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict through dialogue,"" it said in a statement to the UN. Macklemore said on Instagram that several groups had been reaching out to him over the Sudan crisis for months. A representative of Madaniya, an organisation for Sudanese people living in the UK, told BBC News: “A boycott by a major artist is obviously going to bring more attention to the Sudanese cause, which is great. “What would be a wonderful secondary consequence is if more people were to look into the UAE’s involvement in Sudan.” Over the next few weeks, Calvin Harris is due to give a performance in Dubai’s harbour and Sophie Ellis-Bextor has a date at the opera house. Neither replied to a request for comment. Prof Alex de Waal, an expert on Sudan based at Tufts University in Massachusetts, thinks a cultural and sporting boycott could be an effective way of targeting the regional powers accused of fuelling the war. He says the UAE and Saudi Arabia are competing for influence in Africa and are backing opposing sides in Sudan. The Saudi embassy in London has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Prof de Waal is convinced that the Arab rivals are so economically powerful that no-one is likely to sanction them - and says that any such measures would be difficult to implement. It wouldn’t be a priority for many Western countries, he adds, which are pre-occupied with the Israel-Gaza war and tensions with Iran. But he also suggests the UAE and Saudi Arabia care greatly about their reputation on the international stage. “Cultural figures and sports figures saying ‘we're not going there’ counts for much, much more than a threat of trade sanctions or financial penalties. “I think, interestingly, the [threat to them] of soft power is much stronger, and has much greater potential, than hard power.” Dr Crystal Murphy, a specialist on East African finance based at Chapman University in California, points towards protests against apartheid in South Africa which ultimately “rewrote political science and international relations”. She explains: “The boycotts came as a result of tons of public and celebrity [organising] and raising awareness of the issue, where enough people were pushing their governments. “So it can happen,” she adds. “What's the difference between Macklemore and the South Africa boycotts?” Campaigners are a long way from achieving boycotts of that scale, but are hopeful that momentum will gather after Macklemore’s move. The representative of Madaniya describes warring generals as trying to destroy the fabric of Sudanese society. But that doesn’t deter campaigners. “There’s always a hope for the Sudanese people,” the activist says. And already, some people appear to be following in Macklemore's footsteps. One commenter on his post said they'd been invited to speak at a convention in the UAE, but had now changed tack: “Your post encouraged me to research a bit more and I decided to decline the offer.” The Briefing Room dissects Sudan's ongoing war which has become one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ejw1kd7ndo,Key takeaways from first Harris and Walz interview,"The vice-president and Democratic nominee tells CNN her ""values have not changed"" despite shifts on key issues.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:57.344147,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has defended changing her mind on key issues in her first interview since entering the presidential race. The Democratic nominee was pressed on why her policies on immigration and climate have become more moderate since she ran for president in 2019. ""I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash. She also vowed to ""turn the page"" on the divisive rhetoric of the Trump era, in the joint interview with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Her Republican opponent Donald Trump described the interview as ""BORING!!!"" on Truth Social when it concluded, and described Ms Harris as a fraud. The vice-president was forced to defend the White House's economic track record, as inflation and high cost-of-living prices continue to hurt Americans.  When asked why she hadn't already implemented her ideas to tackle economic hardship she said they had done a lot of good work already but there was more to do. Polls suggest that voters would prefer Trump's handling of the economy. Here are the key takeaways from the interview.  Pressed on her move from liberal to more moderate policy positions, she said her values were consistent, pointing to her commitment to tackling climate change as an example. Asked about her reversal on banning fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock, she said she was confident US climate targets could be met without a ban. The main Republican line of attack has been to cast Ms Harris as an extremist, pointing to her 2019 statements as evidence. Back then, she also advocated for the closure of immigration detention centres and the decriminalisation of illegal crossings. She takes a stronger line on the border now, referring to her time ""prosecuting transnational, criminal organisations"" as California attorney general. Earlier this year, she supported a bipartisan border security bill that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for more wall construction. Trump pressured Republicans in Congress to kill the deal, which Ms Harris said in the CNN interview was a cynical political move.  Ms Harris also was asked about the war in Gaza, and re-iterated the White House's position that both Israel and Hamas must ""get a deal done"" and that the Palestinians deserve to have their own country neighbouring Israel. ""This war must end, and we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out,"" she said. While emphasising the importance of a deal, she offered no specifics on how it would be achieved. She would not commit to an arms embargo on Israel, as some on her party's left flank have demanded. To explain her moderated immigration view, the Democratic nominee told CNN that her travels across the country as vice-president had made her believe in building consensus. Expanding on that, she said she would include a Republican in her presidential cabinet.  She said it would fulfill her promise to be a president “for all Americans”. ""I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views."" CNN's Dana Bash asked Ms Harris, born to immigrant parents from Jamaica and India, about recent comments by Trump in which he suggested she assumed a black identity in later life for political purposes. The comments caused an outrage but the vice-president had not weighed in. This time she gave a very short answer. ""Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please."" When asked later in the interview about the historic nature of her candidacy, she said she believed she was the best person to be president for for all Americans, regardless of race and gender.  Mr Walz was asked about misleading statements he has made about his military service and his personal struggle to have children. Ms Bash asked him to clarify a comment he made in which he said he ""carried"" an assault rifle in ""war"". The campaign has clarified that Mr Walz was never in a war zone.  The governor said he wore ""his emotions on his sleeve"" and was ""speaking passionately"" about the subject of gun crime in schools when he made the inaccurate statement. That ""passion"" also extended to his incorrect assertion that his wife had received in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments - which have become a political lightning rod in the US debate over abortion access - to conceive their children.  She received intrauterine insemination, not IVF. ""I spoke about our infertility issues ‘cause it’s hell, and families know this,"" he said on CNN. Ms Harris described the moment that President Biden called her to share that he had decided to end his re-election bid in July. She said her family was visiting her when she received the phone call. They had just eaten pancakes and bacon and were working on a puzzle.  ""My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you, my first thought was about him,"" Ms Harris said when asked whether she asked for his endorsement.  The vice-president also maintained that the president could have served again.  ""He is so smart, and I have spent hours upon hours with him being in the Oval Office and in the situation room. He has the intelligence, the commitment and judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president."" She said Trump, by contrast, had none of those qualities.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn31g50e3o,"Gaza nurse says whole family, including quadruplets, killed in air strike",Ashraf El Attar's wife and six children were killed when an air strike destroyed their home in Deir al-Balah.,21 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:57.445482,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A nurse in Gaza has told the BBC his wife and six children - including a group of quadruplets - were killed in an attack in the central Gaza strip. ""My entire family has been wiped out in an instant"", says Ashraf El Attar, ""leaving me with nothing"". The nurse - who works at Gaza's European hospital - says his family home in Deir-al-Balah was hit in the early hours of Sunday morning. He survived with minor injuries. Israel has not spoken about this specific attack, but has said its forces were operating in the city. It says it only targets members of armed groups. Killed in the strike were Mr El Attar's wife - Hala Khattab, a teacher - and their six children - a 15-year-old boy, a one-year-old girl, and their four 10-year-old quadruplets. Speaking to BBC Arabic's Gaza Today podcast, the nurse says that around 6am on the morning of the attack he was getting ready for work when he ""heard the alarm sound and suddenly lost consciousness"". When he came to, Mr El Attar says he was in ""severe pain"" and the house ""was in ruins"". All the outer walls of their apartment building were destroyed. ""I desperately called out for my children and my wife, but it was too late. ""My six children, including four twins, and my wife were killed instantly in the attack,"" he says. The strike took them by surprise, Mr El Attar says. The night before, the family had spent time ""enjoying a soap opera together"", trying to ""escape the harsh reality of war"". Mr El Attar's mother - and grandmother to his six children - says she ""cannot comprehend"" why their home was hit. ""My son Ashraf works as a nurse at the European hospital, where he is dedicated to helping patients. ""We had no connections with any organisations,"" she says. The couple had an ""incredibly challenging time"" raising their children, she says, in particular the quadruplets. ""The babies faced severe health issues in their early months and nearly died. ""We provided oxygen cylinders at home, and one of them, Hammam, underwent hernia surgery,"" she says. Mr El Attar says his wife - Hala - was ""dedicated"" to helping displaced people. She was working for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), he says, a UN agency that provides support for Palestinian refugees. Now the nurse says he is forced to come to terms with the life they could have had together. ""I worked tirelessly to support my family and watch my children grow up, dreaming of giving them a better future - a big house, a car, and mobile phones,"" he says. But now ""all those dreams have been destroyed"". ""I demand justice for my family"", he says, something he vows to pursue through ""any international court"". ""Israel has committed a grave injustice. My entire family has been wiped out in an instant, leaving me with nothing."" The Israel Defense Forces has not commented on this specific strike, but has said it was operating in Deir al-Balah over the weekend. In another statement on Monday, it said it had been operating in the outskirts of Deir al-Balah ""eliminating terrorists, destroying combat compounds above and below ground"". It says it only targets members of armed groups, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas - who it says places fighters, weapons, tunnels and rockets in residential areas. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w65xg7vy4o,Democrats reject Gaza protesters' demand to give speaking slot to Palestinian,The activists staged a sit-in outside the convention as Democrats ignored their requests.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:57.546962,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Democrats have rejected demands from demonstrators to allow a Palestinian to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Uncommitted delegates - who oppose US support of Israel's war in Gaza - began a sit-in protest just outside of the arena doors on Wednesday night.  But by 18:00 local time on Thursday - the deadline protesters had set to hear from Kamala Harris's campaign - activists said they had not received a response to their requests for a Palestinian to be allowed to take the stage. The sit-in protest on the final night of the convention came as thousands of demonstrators outside the perimeter continued to rally against the war in Gaza and White House policy. The demonstrations this week have been largely peaceful, except for a smaller, unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli consulate that led to 56 arrests.  ""This has been a disastrous decision by the Democratic leadership to deny a bare-minimum ask that we requested weeks ago, prior to the convention,"" said Layla Elabed, a co-leader of the uncommitted national movement. The Harris campaign told the BBC that campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez had met leaders from the uncommitted movement in recent days. ""There have been a number of speakers who have spoken about the war in Gaza and the need to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. You will continue to hear that message,"" a spokesperson said.  Uncommitted delegates were selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year. President Joe Biden won an overwhelming share of primary voters, but pro-Palestinian activists urged people to vote ""uncommitted"" and similar options in a number of states. Enough Democratic voters did so to send 30 delegates to the convention in Chicago, out of a total of more than 2,400 delegates. Israel's war in Gaza has divided the Democratic Party, but has largely been avoided as a topic of discussion during the DNC this week.  The uncommitted protesters said they had given the Harris campaign a list of several potential Palestinians who could speak at the conference.  The activists said the Harris campaign sent aides and lawmakers to the sit-in protest outside the arena on Wednesday night to try to resolve the conflict, but they refused to offer a speaking slot. Uncommitted activists said they were told that the focus of the convention was on the vice-president, as she prepared to give a speech that would be the ""biggest of her life"".  The delegates said they had been asking to have a Palestinian speaker address the crowd at the convention for two months.  ""We're going to have to have a lot of difficult conversations with the vice-president and her team after this,"" said Abbas Alawieh, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan. ""We're going to have to take stock of what happened.""  Despite the large protests outside the arena doors, the war in Gaza has been mentioned by only a handful of speakers throughout the four-day programme.  Mr Alawieh said the goal of having a Palestinian speaker at the convention was about ""forcing"" the Democratic Party to ""create space for talking about Palestinian human rights"".  Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, an outspoken critic of US support of Israel, told the BBC she was not surprised the topic has not been featured much during the convention. “Interestingly, foreign policy never really is a huge topic that’s talked about,” she said. “But I’ve always thought of foreign policy as domestic policy."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gejxxk820o,What is the plan to give polio vaccines to children in Gaza?,Pauses to fighting will allow hundreds of thousands of Gaza children to be vaccinated against polio.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:57.655372,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A series of “humanitarian pauses” to fighting in Gaza are due to begin on Sunday, to allow hundreds of thousands of children to be vaccinated against polio. The agreement comes after UN officials said a 10-month-old has been partially paralysed after contracting Gaza’s first recorded case of polio in 25 years. Polio is a serious and highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five. It is caused by a virus that spreads very easily through contact with the faeces (poo) of an infected person or, less commonly, through contaminated water or food. Most people with the infection have no symptoms but some will have: One in 200 infections lead to more serious problems, when the virus invades the brain and nervous system.  This can causes irreversible paralysis, usually of the legs.  It can happen within a matter of hours and some 5 to 10% of the people who are paralysed die because their breathing muscles become immobilised. Humanitarian groups say the virus has re-emerged because the war between Israel and Hamas has disrupted regular child vaccination programmes. It has also caused massive damage to water and sanitation systems. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. In 2022, polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% for two doses of vaccine. However, this has dropped to less than 90%, according to the latest data. The aim is to vaccinate some 640,000 children under the age of 10, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The roll-out will start in central Gaza on Sunday, with three consecutive daily pauses in fighting between 6am and 3pm local time. It will then move to southern Gaza, where there will be another three-day pause, followed by northern Gaza. According to UN officials, children who get the vaccine will need a second dose in late September. Healthcare workers aim to achieve 95% vaccine coverage across the strip, the level needed to stop transmission of the virus within Gaza. If this is not achieved there is an agreement for an additional humanitarian pause to allow a fourth day of vaccination. About 1.3m doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) are already in Gaza, with 400,000 extra doses set to arrive soon. Vaccinations will be carried out by UN staff and other local health workers. More than 2,000 health and community outreach workers have been trained to give the vaccine.  Vaccines will be available in hospitals, field hospitals and primary health centres. According to the WHO, safe transport and refrigeration of the vaccines are crucial to the plan.  Poliovirus cases have fallen dramatically since 1988, when a global polio eradication initiative was launched. Many countries have not had cases of polio in many years.  But in two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, polio is still endemic, which means it has a constant presence. There have also been outbreaks of poliovirus variants - strains related to the oral vaccine -  in more than 30 countries around the world, particularly in areas where immunisation rates are low. They include Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, DR Congo, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Algeria, Angola,  Indonesia. The WHO says as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of getting polio, because the virus can easily be imported into a polio-free country. There is no cure for polio. It can only be prevented by vaccination, and vaccines must be given multiple times to protect a child for life. There are two main types of vaccines available.  One is an oral vaccine that is given as drops and is effective and easy to administer. The oral vaccine contains a live but weakened from of the virus. This replicates in the gut for a short time and activates the immune system so the body is ready to fight off polio if it encounters the virus again. Rarely, the weakened vaccine-virus can pick up small genetic changes as it replicates. These rare changes can sometimes cause the virus to make people ill with polio -  if it has the chance to spread to unvaccinated people. In Gaza, a novel version of the oral vaccine will be given to help address this. The other main form of polio vaccine is given by injection and contains inactivated polio virus. It has been used in the US and UK for the last two decades.  In the UK, the National Health Service offers five doses from the ages of eight weeks to 14 years as part of routine childhood jabs. Because of vaccines, more than 20 million people who would otherwise have been paralysed are able to walk, according to the WHO.  Graphics by Visual Journalism Team"

The ""uncommitted"" delegates were hoping as late as Wednesday evening that a Palestinian-American politician would be allowed to speak critically about Israel's war in Gaza. But a spokesman for the Uncommitted National Movement said their request was turned down. Abbas Alawieh, an uncommitted delegate from Michigan, relayed the news outside the United Center, where the convention concludes on Thursday. ""We were hopeful because Vice-President Harris's team was engaging with us,"" Mr Alawieh told reporters. ""We just want to be heard."" The BBC contacted Kamala Harris's campaign for comment. The uncommitted delegates were selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year - part of an internal party protest against US support for Israel. President Joe Biden won an overwhelming share of primary voters, but pro-Palestinian activists urged people to vote ""uncommitted"" and similar options in a number of states.  Enough Democratic voters did so to send 30 delegates to the convention in Chicago, out of a total of more than 2,400 delegates.  Mr Alawieh said it was ""unacceptable"" that their request for a speaking slot was turned down. ""We're not going anywhere before November,"" he said. ""You're not going to get rid of us. We're going to engage the system.""  After they announced that their request had been rejected, Mr Alawieh and three other uncommitted delegates began a sit-in outside the arena.  The delegates also said that they had collected signatures from nearly 250 Harris delegates supporting a ceasefire in Gaza. The war in the Middle East has been the main focus of a series of protests outside the Democratic convention this week.  On Monday several thousand protesters marched by the United Center, although the turnout was less than organisers had expected. A smaller protest held outside the Israeli consulate in Chicago on Tuesday led to clashes between protesters and police, resulting in 56 arrests. Another march outside the convention site is planned for Thursday evening. Cook County, where Chicago is located, is home to the country's largest Palestinian community. "

Inbal Albini Peri told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her 80-year-old father Chaim and his friends would have been among the first people freed under any agreement with Hamas and that they “should have come back alive”. Mr Netanyahu has insisted he is making every effort to bring back all of the remaining hostages kidnapped during Hamas’s 7 October attack. But Ms Albini Peri said: “I don’t believe a word he is saying.” “I want him to say to my family and all the other families: ‘I’m sorry. I was wrong."" In her interview, Ms Peri did not explicitly explain what she meant by ""political priorities"". Mr Netanyahu's far-right allies have vowed to pull out of his coalition, undermining his chances of staying in power, if he agrees to release large numbers of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return for hostages.  On Tuesday evening, a senior US administration official criticised the prime minister for making what they called “maximalist statements” that were “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line”. It followed reported comments by Mr Netanyahu suggesting he had told the US secretary of state that Israeli forces must stay in strategic parts of Gaza, which Hamas rejects. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and the freeing of some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 105 hostages are still being held, 34 of whom are presumed dead. Chaim Peri lived in Kibbutz Nir Oz, which was one of the 26 communities and towns close to the Gaza perimeter fence targeted by Hamas on 7 October. The film lecturer and lifelong peace activist was abducted after he voluntarily left the saferoom of his home to protect his wife, Osnat, who was hiding inside. Inbal Peri's 34-year-old half-brother, Danny Darlington, was also killed in the attack. In December, Hamas’s military wing released a video showing Mr Peri along with two other elderly hostages from Nir Oz - Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper. Mr Peri could be seen addressing the camera and calling for their release. “That is more or less the last that we heard from him. Now we know that he probably died around February,” Ms Peri told the BBC. In June, the Israeli military informed the family that Mr Peri, Mr Metzger, Mr Cooper and British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell had been killed during an operation in the Khan Younis area, in southern Gaza, citing intelligence it had gathered. On Tuesday morning, Ms Peri was told that Israeli troops had recovered the bodies of her father and five other hostages - Mr Metzger, Mr Popplewell, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder and Yagev Buchshtab - from underground tunnels in Khan Younis. “For my family it’s maybe a small closure. It’s not the right word to say ‘happy’, but for us it is the end of the way and we are burying our father in the place that he loved so much,” she said.  “But there are other hostages that are still alive, and the chances that will come back alive are getting smaller.” Ms Peri said she believed that her father and his friends from Nir Oz also should have come home alive as part of a new hostage release deal, which the US, Qatar and Egypt were trying to broker before her father was thought to have died and are continuing to do now. “It only depended on our government and the mental standing of our prime minister, who had different priorities. He had political priorities. And that makes us very, very angry and frustrated. “I’m not saying that we could really stop the war, but we had to do the negotiations instead of keeping on fighting. We have seen for over 10 months that it’s not working.” When asked if she had put this directly to Mr Netanyahu or other members of his government, she replied: “Many people from the government did talk to us and try to help. But when the head is wrong, it doesn’t matter.” She added: “We want our government and our prime minister to go ahead and have a deal, to have something to talk about, instead of risking over and over again our soldiers to bring back bodies. We don’t want any more soldiers to be killed.” “Bring back all the hostages because they are still alive. And their time is really running out.” On Tuesday night, Mr Netanyahu’s office said he had told hostages’ families in Jerusalem that “the first thing is to eliminate Hama and achieve victory”. “The second thing is that we are, at the same time, making an effort to return the hostages, on terms that will allow for the maximum number of hostages being released in the first stage of the deal. I say this clearly: This is an objective that I have set,” he added. “However, the other thing is to preserve our strategic security assets in the face of major domestic and foreign pressure, and we are doing so."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo,"Twelve killed in Israeli strike on Gaza school, civil defence says",Israel's military says it targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the Gaza City school.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:57.920101,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City, the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority says. A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood. The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians. Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area. The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed. Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike. The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building. ""We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion,"" witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency. ""The people are gone, they're dead. They are under the rubble."" Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people. He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel. ""Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence,"" it added. The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied. Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the ""increasing frequency"" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them ""with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities"". The warning after at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City, according to the director of a local hospital. The IDF said the school had ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 ""terrorists"" who were killed. The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities. Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah. The IDF said its troops and aircraft had ""eliminated numerous terrorists"" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device. It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. The BBC's Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation. After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties. But Hamas accused the US of ""acquiescing"" to what it called Mr Netanyahu's ""new conditions"". The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement. A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected.  He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6ynq1jwdqo,US criticises Israeli PM's 'maximalist' ceasefire stance,"A senior US official says Benjamin Netanyahu's reported comments are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal"".",21 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:58.006558,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A senior US administration official has pushed back at reported comments by Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing the Israeli prime minister of making “maximalist statements” that are “not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line”. It comes in the midst of an intense round of regional diplomacy by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as Washington tries to drive forward progress on a ceasefire and hostage release deal.  On Monday, Mr Blinken had talks lasting three hours with the Israeli leader in Jerusalem.  He later said Mr Netanyahu had accepted Washington’s so-called “bridging proposal” aimed at trying to solve sticking points and bring Israel and Hamas closer to a deal. According to an Israeli media report, Mr Netanyahu later told a meeting of hostage families that he ""convinced"" Mr Blinken that the deal must see Israeli troops remaining in areas of Gaza he described as “strategic military and political assets”, including along the southern border with Egypt. The reported comments appear to have irritated the US administration.  ""We saw the prime minister's comments, specifically on some of these items,"" said the senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We’re certainly not going to negotiate in public but what I can say is that the only thing Secretary Blinken and the United States are convinced of is the need for getting a ceasefire proposal across the finish line."" ""We fully expect that… if Hamas were also to also accept this bridging proposal, discussions will continue on some of the more technical... details. “I would also just add that maximalist statements like this are not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line and they certainly risk the ability of implementing level, working level and technical talks to be able to move forward when both parties agree to a bridging proposal.” The senior official’s remarks followed Tuesday’s round of talks between Mr Blinken and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the coastal city of El-Alamein.  Egyptian officials are said to be strongly opposed to the idea of Israeli troops remaining along Egypt's border in Gaza. Following his stop in Egypt, Mr Blinken travelled on to Qatar for further talks in Doha - the last stop on his Middle East tour. The BBC has been travelling with the secretary of state and asked him about the conversation shortly before he left Doha. He revealed for the first time that the American bridging proposal included a ""detailed plan"" about Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. ""The agreement is very clear on the schedule and locations of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawals from Gaza and Israel has agreed to that,"" said Mr Blinken. Asked by the BBC whether Mr Netanyahu's reported claim that the Israeli leader had ""convinced"" Mr Blinken to keep troops in Gaza, he said: ""I can't speak to what he's quoted as saying, I can just speak to what I heard from him directly yesterday [Monday] when we spent three hours together,"" he said. ""[That included] Israel's endorsement of the bridging proposal and thus the detailed plan. And that plan among other things includes a very clear schedule and locations for withdrawals."" Asked whether the proposal was for a ""full withdrawal"", Mr Blinken said he would not comment on the details of the plan. Hamas said the latest ceasefire proposals constituted ""a coup"" against what had been agreed upon in earlier negotiations, and reiterated its wish that a ceasefire plan for Gaza be based on where talks were in July rather than any new rounds of negotiations.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dg0y12e7do,Robertson not considering position over Israel meeting,The cabinet secretary has come under fire from SNP colleagues over talks with the deputy ambassador.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:58.098909,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Angus Robertson says he has not considered resigning over a controversial meeting with Israel's deputy ambassador to the UK. The external affairs secretary has faced a backlash, including from some SNP colleagues who are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Mr Robertson said First Minister John Swinney was aware of the meeting taking place but the pair had not discussed it in person. The Scottish government has since suspended meetings with Israel until progress is made in peace talks. Mr Robertson has said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire. He met Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky, on 8 August after accepting an invitation from the Israeli government.  Four days later, Ms Grudsky posted a photo of the pair on social media. She said they had discussed the release of Israeli hostages and that Israel was “looking forward to co-operating” with Scotland in areas including culture and renewables. That sparked criticism from SNP figures - including former ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - about the decision to take the meeting. Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Robertson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: “No, I haven't, because I think it was right to communicate the message that we did. “But I have reflected very strongly on the impact that it has created and the impression that was created, which is why I issued the apology yesterday. “I most certainly did not want to create an impression that there was a normalisation of relations between the Scottish government and the Israeli government when there is not.” The external affairs secretary said issues which did not relate to the war were raised by Ms Grudsky, including energy, tourism and economic co-operation. ""That meeting was not an appropriate space or time for that meeting to take place,"" he said.  Asked if he spoke to the first minister about the meeting before attending, Mr Robertson replied: “I don't think I spoke about it in person with him, but it was part of the government's internal deliberations, which included an official recommendation to meet that he was aware of. ""But it was me who ultimately made the decision that the meeting should go ahead. “Why? Because it would be the first opportunity to lay out the Scottish government and indeed the Scottish Parliament's strong opposition to what is and has been happening in Gaza."" He also Israeli officials were keen to raise issues around antisemitism.  Mr Swinney has acknowledged that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”, but stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. In fresh criticism from within the party, veteran MSP Christine Grahame described Mr Robertson as a ""liability"" in a leaked email to the first minister, published by the Scottish Daily Mail. Meanwhile, SNP MSP Ruth Maguire told the Herald she shared the ""anger"" felt by party members in relation to the meeting. Mr Robertson insisted that it was right for the Scottish government to make its case to the Israeli government.  “Scotland's voice does matter,"" he told Good Morning Scotland.  ""It won’t change things overnight, of course not, but we have things to say and in this case we call for the Israelis to end what they are doing in Gaza, that humanitarian supplies should be allowed in, that civilians should not be targeted.” The SNP minister said the meeting was minuted but would be subject to “special considerations that relate to intergovernmental relations”. He added: “I am being absolutely clear about the issues I talked about in the tone and content in which the message was relayed for the need for the Israelis to stop what they are doing in Gaza.” On the same day that Ms Grudsky posted the photo - 12 August - the Scottish government released a statement referring to areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel.   The Gaza conflict was addressed in the press release, but not in as strong terms as Scottish government ministers had used previously.  There was no specific mention of civilian deaths in Gaza or of weapons sales to Israel. In a statement released on Monday announcing that further meetings with Israeli officials would be suspended, Mr Robertson said the government had been ""consistent in our unequivocal condemnation of the atrocities we have witnessed in Gaza"".  He told Good Morning Scotland the SNP government had ""ongoing dialogue"" with the Palestinian delegation in the UK. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy previously told BBC Scotland News that it was the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations ""as part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK"". They said it remained ""resolute in fulfilling our duty to represent the state of Israel""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge9k0r1llo,Biden says Gaza protesters 'have a point' after thousands gather at DNC,A security fence was breached but most demonstrators taking to Chicago's streets remained peaceful.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:09.786439,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest near the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on its opening day, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. But several demonstrators were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence around the Chicago venue. The turnout appeared to be well below the tens of thousands that organisers had hoped for and short of the 15,000 they claimed turned out. Later in the evening, President Joe Biden acknowledged that the protesters ""out on the street have a point"" in his primetime convention farewell speech. ""A lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides,"" he said, adding that a US-brokered ceasefire - which has so far proved elusive - was necessary. Protests in Chicago have highlighted divisions among Democrats over one of the most contentious issues on the left of American politics, US support for Israel’s war in Gaza. At one point during Monday's protest, a small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators knocked down a fence around the convention security perimeter and streamed through. Chicago Police said the protesters did not breach an inner security fence and that the situation was quickly contained. At least four people were detained.  Many of the Gaza war demonstrators said they saw little difference between Mr Biden and his Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is formally accepting the Democratic White House nomination this week after the president dropped out of the race last month and endorsed her. “The Democratic Party may present a new face, but its support for Israeli repression remains unchanged,” said Omar Younes, a co-founder of Jisoor, a Palestinian youth organisation in Chicago. Another protester, Tallis George Munro, said he would definitely vote for Ms Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, but did not want to give them a “free pass” on their support for Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr Munro, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he was more worried about what he described as a ""bigger threat"" – the policies of Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""We are close to white Christian nationalism with Trump,"" he said. ""That is the biggest problem in this country now."" Other protesters told the BBC they would vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, or they would not vote at all.  The rally-goers also heard from independent presidential candidate Cornel West, a philosophy professor and left-wing activist. ""This is not about some Machiavellian politics or some utilitarian calculation about an election,"" he told the crowd. ""This is about morality.""  After months of legal wrangling over the route, protesters followed a 1.1 mile (1.8km) path around the DNC site, chanting slogans including ""No justice, no peace, US out of the Middle East"" and ""Kamala Harris is a cop, all this violence has to stop"" – a reference to the vice-president's career as a prosecutor and California attorney general. The demonstrators also chanted ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". This refers to the land between the River Jordan, bordering the occupied West Bank and Israel in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Anti-semitism monitors say it calls for the destruction of Israel but pro-Palestinian groups deny the slogan is hateful. Earlier in the day, a small contingent of pro-Israeli counter-protesters briefly rallied on the edge of Union Park, where the pro-Palestinian march began and ended. The march drew people from neighbouring states and further afield. Karyna Lemus attended as a member of the Colorado Springs People’s Coalition. She said she’s been involved in the Palestinian rights movement for decades. “I hope they hear us inside,” she said of the DNC delegates. Protests will continue for the rest of the week during the convention. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

The SNP administration has faced criticism after External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson met Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky. Mr Robertson said he was sorry that the meeting was not ""strictly limited"" to talks about a ceasefire. He said the government would not accept further invitations from Israel until ""real progress"" had been made towards peace, on humanitarian assistance and until Israel ""co-operates fully with its international obligations on the investigation of genocide and war crimes"".  The meeting prompted a backlash from many SNP figures who have been highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East. But after the fallout last week, First Minister John Swinney defended the face-to-face meeting in a statement posted online. He acknowledged that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”, but stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. Mr Robertson said the meeting was not an attempt to legitimatise the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.  ""The Scottish government has been consistent in our unequivocal condemnation of the atrocities we have witnessed in Gaza,"" he said. “The reality, however, is that this meeting has been taken by many to represent a normalisation of relations between the Israeli and Scottish governments. “As such, it is clear that it would have been better to ensure that the meeting was strictly limited to the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the appalling loss of life in the region. I apologise for the fact that this did not happen."" He said it would ""not be appropriate to accept any invitation"" for future meetings until ""real progress has been made towards peace"". The apology follows remarks on the conflict from SNP MSP John Mason who posted on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. Mr Mason was suspended from the party's Holyrood group but has said he ""completely"" stands by his remarks. He told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the situation in Gaza was ""nothing like"" previous examples of genocide. Mr Robertson met Ms Grudsky on 8 August, but it was four days later before the Scottish government released a statement about it. The statement referenced areas of “mutual interest” between Scotland and Israel, and said that Mr Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides"". It said that he had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza"". A spokesperson has since said the delay in going public about the meeting was at the request of the Israeli Embassy on ""security grounds"". In his apology, Mr Robertson said it was his decision to take the meeting, which had been requested by Israel, but the first minister was made aware before it happened. The external affairs minister said: ""My view was that given the Israeli UK Deputy Ambassador had requested a meeting it was an opportunity to express the Scottish government's clear and unwavering position on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and I did exactly that."" However SNP figures - including former ministers Emma Roddick, Kevin Stewart and Elena Whitham - criticised the decision to take the meeting. Mr Robertson said it was really important for a country like Scotland ""where we are aspiring to have an independent state"" to have diplomatic relations and lay out any differences ""when we are in dialogue with countries we are in disagreement with"". Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, welcomed the apology for the diplomatic encounter which was “clearly an astonishing error of judgement”. “Holding a meeting of this kind with the state of Israel at this time looks like normalising acts of genocide,” he said. “It’s really important that the Scottish government has acknowledged what a serious mistake they made holding a meeting of that kind. “But I want this to be about more than the optics of a single meeting, I want it to be about a change of practice.” He urged the Scottish government to ensure financial support was not given to arms companies which supplied weapons to Israel or were “complicit in illegal settlements”. A spokesperson of the Israel Embassy previously told BBC Scotland News that it was the work of foreign diplomats to engage and foster relations ""as part of the longstanding and positive relationship between Israel and the UK"". They said it remained ""resolute in fulfilling our duty to represent the state of Israel"". Last year Mr Robertson faced similar criticism after some SNP members felt he should have taken a firmer position on China."

A statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the bodies of Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Yoram Metzger, Chaim Peri and British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell were recovered from the Khan Younis area on Monday. Five of their deaths had already been announced by Israel, though it was thought Avraham Munder could still be alive. The overnight recovery operation was carried out by the IDF alongside the security agency Shin Bet. During the operation, the IDF said its forces located a 10m (33ft) deep tunnel shaft which led to an ""underground tunnel route"", inside which the bodies were found.  They were retrieved after ""prolonged combat in a built-up area and in multi-story buildings"". The six men were all kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and Kibbutz Nirim, near Israel’s border fence with Gaza, during Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. In June, Israel confirmed the deaths of Mr Popplewell, 51, Mr Peri, 79, and Mr Metzger, 80. The IDF stated the three men had died during an Israeli operation in Khan Younis. In July, the IDF also confirmed the deaths of Mr Buchshtab, 35, and Mr Dancyg, 76, stating an investigation was being carried out into how they died. Israeli media, citing military sources, reported at the time there was a “high probability” that at least one of the men was killed by Israeli fire. Mati Dancyg, Alexander Dancyg’s son, said on Tuesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government had chosen to ""abandon the hostages in order to survive"". ""Netanyahu chose to sacrifice the hostages. Karma will judge him and he will pay for it, big time,"" he told Israeli public broadcaster Kan. Government estimates suggest there are 105 hostages remaining in Gaza, 71 of whom are thought to be alive. An additional four hostages were already in Gaza prior to 7 October, two of whom are believed to be dead. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement the bodies were retrieved after a ""complex operation"", adding that Israel would keep working on “dismantling Hamas"". Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he sent “heartfelt condolences and a warm embrace” to the families of those whose bodies were returned. ""We must not stop for a moment from working in every way possible to bring back all the hostages,"" he added. In a statement, the Hostage Families Forum said the recovery of the bodies had provided the families with ""necessary closure"", adding that the return of the remaining hostages from Gaza ""can only be achieved through a negotiated deal"". The group called on the Israeli government to ""do everything in its power to finalize the deal currently on the table"". Negotiations over a long-sought-after ceasefire and hostage release deal are ongoing, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arriving in Egypt on Tuesday to discuss a potential deal with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. On Monday, Mr Blinken said Mr Netanyahu had agreed to a US ""bridging proposal"" for a deal, after the pair met in Jerusalem. Mr Netanyahu described the discussion as ""positive"". The IDF said on Monday that it had expanded its operation in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, and the outskirts of the central town of Deir al-Balah. Five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on an internet distribution facility in western Khan Younis on Monday, according to local health officials. A medical source also told AFP news agency that three people were killed in Abasan, east of the city. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,173 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58zqgle9ro,Hamas claims Tel Aviv bomb explosion as suicide attack,Israeli security forces said Sunday's blast killed the suspected attacker and injured a passer-by.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:10.076786,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hamas has claimed it was behind a bomb explosion in Tel Aviv on Sunday night which Israeli authorities say killed the suspected attacker and injured a civilian. A statement from the armed group said it had been a “martyrdom operation"" carried out in co-operation with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It also warned that suicide attacks would “return to the forefront” if Israel continued what it called “massacres” of Palestinians. Israel’s police force and Shin Bet domestic security service said earlier that they could confirm it was a terrorist attack involving a powerful explosive device. The blast happened on Lehi Street in southern Tel Aviv, about an hour after the US secretary of state landed in the city to push for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. CCTV footage filmed moments before appeared to show a middle aged man walking past a shop carrying a full backpack. Israel’s Magen David Adom service said paramedics found an unconscious man in his 50s with multiple systemic injuries who they pronounced dead at the scene. A 33-year-old bystander who suffered shrapnel injuries to his limbs and chest was treated by the paramedics before being taken to a local hospital. ""It was a miracle that it did not explode in the nearest synagogue or in the shopping centre. It could have ended in dozens of deaths,"" Ayalon District Police Commander Haim Bublil said on Monday, according to the Jerusalem Post newspaper. The identity of the perpetrator is not yet known, but police suspect he was a Palestinian. In a separate development on Sunday, an Israeli security guard was killed by a Palestinian man at an industrial area near the settlement of Kedumim, in the north of the occupied West Bank, Israeli authorities said. Gideon Perry, a 38-year-old father of three, was fatally wounded when he was hit with a hammer by a labourer, who then stole his firearm and drove away. The local Israeli military commander, Maj-Gen Avi Bluth, said it was a “very serious terrorist attack” and that troops were in pursuit of the attacker. So far, no Palestinian armed groups have claimed they were behind the attack, which came three days after a deadly rampage by Israeli settlers at a Palestinian village near Kedumim. The Palestinian health ministry said a Palestinian man was shot dead as settlers set fire to a number of vehicles and homes in Jit, in an incident which brought swift and unusual condemnation from Israeli leaders. There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3xzex72no,Israel accepts 'bridging proposal' for ceasefire deal - Blinken,US Secretary State Antony Blinken met with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to push for an urgent ceasefire.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:10.187811,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to an American ""bridging proposal"" for a ceasefire deal in Gaza. It is now up to Hamas to agree, Mr Blinken added. The pair met in Tel Aviv for talks that Mr Netanyahu has described as ""positive"", with his office adding that he had reiterated his commitment to an American proposal on the release of the hostages still held by Hamas, which took into account Israel’s security needs. Mr Blinken had earlier warned this was ""maybe the last opportunity"" to secure a ceasefire agreement, as the US hopes to push a deal over the finish line. The Americans hope that could happen perhaps as soon as this time next week, but that level of optimism is not shared by the Israeli leadership or Hamas. Each accuses the other of obstinate cynicism, and blocking a deal. Speaking in Tel Aviv after the talks, Mr Blinken described ""the fierce urgency"" of progressing towards a truce and hostage release deal. ""We're never giving up"", he added, saying more delays could mean more hostages could die and further obstacles could hamper any agreement. The US secretary of state will now travel on to Egypt and then Qatar, to try and drive forward progress on a deal. Mr Netanyahu reportedly told Mr Blinken that he planned to send a negotiating team to Cairo later this week for a new round of talks with Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators. Meanwhile, reports from Gaza speak of a worsening humanitarian situation amid continuing Israeli military activity. Israel said its aircraft and troops had killed “eliminated dozens of terrorists” over the past day and destroyed Hamas compounds and a tunnel network where rockets and missiles were found. Palestinian media reported that six people had been killed in an Israeli air strike near an internet access point near the southern city of Khan Younis on Monday, and that another four were killed in a strike on a car in Gaza City, in the north. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,130 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages during a week-long ceasefire in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead. Mr Blinken was in Israel on Monday for a series of talks with key Israeli leaders. After one meeting - with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant - a large crowd of protesters outside could be heard chanting ""SOS USA, hostage deal now"" and ""Blinken we trust you, bring them home"". Some were holding pictures of hostages. That sense of urgency was in Mr Blinken's messages was clear. “This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,” he said before talks with President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv. “I'm here as part of an intensive diplomatic effort on President Biden's instructions to try to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line,” he added. “It is time for everyone to get to ‘yes’ and to not look for any excuses to say ‘no’.” Speaking alongside him, President Herzog blamed what he called “the refusal of Hamas to move forward” with a deal. Mr Blinken then had a three-hour meeting in Jerusalem with Mr Netanyahu, whose office said was “positive and was held in a good atmosphere”. “The prime minister reiterated Israel's commitment to the current American proposal on the release of our hostages, which takes into account Israel's security needs, which he strongly insists on,” a brief statement added. On Sunday, the prime minister accused Hamas of being “completely obstinate” and insisted that “pressure needs to be directed” at the group - which Israel, the US and other countries proscribe as a terrorist organisation. A Qatar-based member of Hamas’s political bureau told the BBC on Monday that it was “still interested” in reaching a deal, although he said it would not be participating in the Cairo meetings. “We agreed a deal [through mediators] on 2 July... and therefore we don't need a new round of negotiations or to discuss the new demands of Benjamin Netanyahu,” Basem Naim said. “We have shown maximum flexibility and positivity and the other party has understood this as a weakness and met it with more force - he is not interested in reaching a ceasefire, only in flaring up the region... and serving his own personal political interests."" The US is holding out hope that in the coming days, it can bridge the gaps on a ceasefire deal. However, that deadline is being imposed by Washington, rather than the warring parties. And the Israeli prime minister and the leaders of Hamas do not seem to feel that same sense of urgency. Their statements last night were very defiant, sticking to their positions and digging in. On Tuesday, Mr Blinken will fly from Israel to Egypt, which has been an important mediator along with Qatar and is able to pass messages directly to Hamas. The mediators announced last Friday that they had presented “a proposal that narrows the gaps between the parties” and was consistent with the principles set out by President Joe Biden on 31 May, which would run in three phases: • The first would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel • The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"" • The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains The Americans have not provided details about bridging proposal, but major differences are said to remain on issues including Israel’s continuing military presence in Gaza, the rights of displaced Palestinians to move freely from north to south and the number and identity of Palestinian prisoners who’d be released from Israeli jails in exchange for Israeli hostages. Brett McGurk, one of the Biden administration’s key envoys in the region, has been working with the Egyptians over the past couple of weeks to address the sticking point of the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land that runs along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Mr Netanyahu says he insists that Israel will remain present there to stop smuggling and Hamas rearming. Hamas says it simply means continued Israeli occupation and therefore not a stop to the war."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeyz89rwdro,Will sorry save Robertson after Israeli meeting?,BBC Scotland's Lynsey Bews considers the political fallout of the Scottish government's meeting with Israel's ambassador to the UK.,20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:10.281495,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Just over a week ago, the Israeli deputy ambassador to the UK posted a photograph on social media that sparked fury within the SNP. Daniela Grudsky smiled as she posed with Scotland's external affairs secretary. She thanked Angus Robertson for ""welcoming us to wonderful Scotland"", adding that she was ""looking forward to cooperating in the fields of technology, culture and renewable energy"". This, to many both inside and outside the party, was an outrage. SNP politicians had spent months pushing their position on Gaza - pressing for an immediate ceasefire, an end of arms sales to Israel, and the recognition of the Palestinian state. They had urged others to ""find their moral compass"", and yet here was a senior member of the Scottish government discussing areas of ""mutual interest"" with a representative of the Israeli administration. Criticism has been widespread inside the party, and expressed both publicly and privately at all levels. From grassroots members, to MSPs, MPs, former - and even current - ministers. For some, the decision to take the meeting at all was wrong. Others accept - as Mr Robertson argues - that this was an opportunity to put the government's views directly to the Israelis. However, they were concerned about the scope of the discussions, and the notion there could be any cooperation between the two countries. Certainly there has been immense pressure on the Scottish government to explain itself. And its handling of the row has undoutedly prolonged it. For more than a week after the deputy ambassador's post, the criticism grew. The first minister had intervened, acknowledging the anger but doubling down on the decision to take the meeting. But questions remained over just how robust Mr Robertson had been in his condemnation of Israel's conduct. Comments from the SNP backbench MSP John Mason - who held his own meeting with the deputy ambassador  - that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza resulted in him being suspended from the party, and only served to heighten things. While the anger was certainly palpable, there was no sense in government that Mr Robertson's position was becoming untenable. It was clear however that he would need to speak out. And so came an apology for not limiting the talks to a call for an immediate ceasefire, with confirmation no further meetings would take place until the situation in Gaza changes. It was an attempt to get on the front foot ahead of the SNP's conference at the end of this month - to be contrite and to take the heat out of what was becoming an increasingly public backlash. So will it be enough? Mr Robertson says he has not considered quitting his ministerial post. And, given he has the backing of the first minister, it would seem unlikely he's going anywhere soon. Former First Minister Humza Yousaf, who was praised for his own handling of the Gaza issue, said Mr Robertson had ""clearly listened and reflected on the anger and upset"". Aside from the Scottish Greens, most of that anger has come from within his own party, so the external affairs secretary is unlikely to come under cross-party pressure when Holyrood returns in September. Labour doesn't have its own troubles to seek when it comes to Gaza, with Sir Keir Starmer facing protests during a recent visit to Scotland for his handling of the issue. To criticise the Scottish government would leave it open to accusations of hypocrisy. The Conservatives have also stayed out of the row. Indeed Scottish Tory leadership hopeful Russell Findlay said he would also have taken the meeting. It's not the first time Mr Robertson has faced criticism over his handling of his brief. A visit to China last year to promote business and tourism was called into question by one of the SNP's MPs, given the country's human rights record. Some argue that engaging with those who you don't agree with is part and parcel of diplomacy - all part of the external affairs secretary's job. However, sensitivities around the politics of the Middle East are such that some won't be satisfied with a pledge of no further meetings with the Israelis. And Mr Robertson might find the criticism from this particular incident difficult to shake off. The party conference could be another flashpoint, with one SNP branch reportedly planning to put pressure on him with a condemnatory motion. It's unclear whether it will reach the conference floor, but at a time when the SNP leadership wants to unite its party, it will be keen to move on from another issue that has caused further division."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvpm1049d9o,Foreign Office official resigns over Israel arms sales,"The official resigned over arms sales to Israel, saying the UK government ""may be complicit in war crimes"".",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:10.380359,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A British Foreign Office official who worked on counter terrorism has resigned in protest at arms sales to Israel, saying the UK government “may be complicit in war crimes”. Mark Smith wrote to colleagues on Friday, saying he had raised concerns “at every level” in the Foreign Office, including through an official whistle blowing mechanism. Mr Smith, who was based at the British Embassy in Dublin, added he had received nothing more than basic acknowledgments. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) declined to comment on an individual case but said the government was committed to upholding international law.  The resignation email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent to a wide set of distribution lists including hundreds of government officials, embassy staff and special advisers to Foreign Office ministers. Details of Mr Smith’s resignation were first broken by the journalist Hind Hassan. Mr Smith said he had previously worked in Middle East arms export licensing assessment for the government and “each day” colleagues were witnessing “clear and unquestionable examples” of war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law by Israel in Gaza. “Senior members of the Israeli government and military have expressed open genocidal intent, Israeli soldiers take videos deliberately burning, destroying and looting civilian property,” he wrote. “Whole streets and universities have been demolished, humanitarian aid is being blocked and civilians are regularly left with no safe quarter to flee to. Red Crescent ambulances have been attacked, schools and hospitals are regularly targeted. These are War Crimes.” He said there was “no justification for the UK's continued arms sales to Israel”. The FCDO said Foreign Secretary David Lammy had initiated a review “on day one in office” to assess whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law. While hundreds of officials in the UK, Europe and the US have registered unprecedented levels of dissent at their governments’ policies towards Israel over the war in Gaza, there have been far fewer known cases of so-called principled resignations, meaning Mr Smith’s case is extremely rare for the British government. Details of Mr Smith's resignation first emerged when the journalist Hind Hassan posted a copy of its contents on the social media platform X on Friday. According to the email, his role was “Second Secretary Counter Terrorism” - understood to be a relatively junior rank, but one in which he described himself as “a subject matter expert in the domain of arms sales policy” after “a long career in the diplomatic service”. His email continued: “Ministers claim that the UK has one of the most ‘robust and transparent’ arms export licensing regimes in the world, however this is the opposite of the truth.” “As a fully cleared officer raising serious concerns of illegality in this Department, to be disregarded in this way is deeply troubling. It is my duty as a public servant to raise this.” A source close to Mr Smith said his email was limited to internal government addressees and he did not resign publicly. Since the story has emerged in public, Mr Smith has issued a statement calling on the government to “listen to the concerns” of civil servants, adding that he was previously the lead author of the central assessment governing the legality of UK arms sales in the Middle East and North Africa Directorate. He said: “It was my job to gather all relevant information regarding civilian casualties, international law compliance as well as assess the commitment and capabilities of the countries in question.” “To export arms to any nation, the UK must be satisfied that the recipient nation has in place robust procedures to avoid civilian casualties and to minimize harm to civilian life. It is impossible to argue that Israel is doing that.” “I have written to the Foreign Secretary informing him of my resignation and urging him to urgently review the UK approach to the situation in Gaza. I sincerely hope that he will listen to the concerns of Civil Servants on this issue and make the necessary changes.” Since 2008, the UK has granted licences for weapons exports to Israel worth £574m ($727m) in total, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).  The UK government has recently played down the scale of the supply, calling it ""relatively small"" at £42m ($53m) in 2022. Israel has repeatedly denied breaching international humanitarian law in Gaza. Responding to previous cases of dissent by Western officials over policy and arms supply, Israel’s government has said it is acting to defeat Hamas as “a genocidal terrorist organisation which commits war crimes as well as crimes against humanity"". In May, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and defence minister, as well as for leaders of Hamas, for war crimes, but these have yet to be issued. An FCDO spokesperson said: “This government is committed to upholding international law. We have made clear that we will not export items if they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of International Humanitarian Law.” The spokesperson added: “There is an ongoing review process to assess whether Israel is complying with International Humanitarian Law, which the Foreign Secretary initiated on day one in office.  We will provide an update as soon as that review process has been completed.”"

The Sounion, which is carrying 150,000 tonnes of crude oil, was first hit by gunfire from two small boats which approached it 77 nautical miles (143km) west of the Yemeni port of Hudaydah, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) office said. Later, the ship was struck by three unidentified projectiles, which sparked a fire and left it without engine power, it added. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but US officials blamed Yemen-based Houthis. The group has launched multiple attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. On Thursday, EU's Red Sea naval mission said one of its ships had destroyed an unmanned surface vessel (USV) as it rescued all of those on board and transported them to Djibouti. “The MV Sounion now represents a navigational and environmental hazard,” EUNAVFOR warned. “It is essential that everyone in the area exercises caution and refrains from any actions that could lead to a deterioration of the current situation.” The Sounion’s operator, Delta Tankers, said the fire onboard was extinguished before it was abandoned by the crew and that it was working on a plan to move the vessel to a safer destination for further checks and repairs.  The vessel was initially adrift after losing engine power but is now at anchor. No group has yet said it was behind the attacks, which Greece’s minister of maritime affairs condemned as a flagrant violation of international law. However, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement has repeatedly targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November. The Houthis say they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. They have not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels or by US and British air strikes on territory they control in north-western Yemen. Israel also bombed Hudaydah’s port last month in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh directly blamed the group for the attack, and raised doubts about what had been accomplished with it. Ms Singh added she was ""not exactly sure how [the attack] helps anyone in Gaza"". She pointed out the ship was sailing under a Greek flag, with a crew of Russian and Filipino sailors.  The Sounion, which is a 274m-long and 50m-wide “Suezmax” tanker, was carrying crude oil from the Iraqi port of Basra when it was attacked. EUNAVFOR said the tanker had not asked for protection from the mission beforehand, but that a ship had been dispatched to rescue the crew following a request from the master. Regarding the potential environmental impact of the attack, Ms Singh said US officials would consult with the ship's operators, but said she was not ""aware of anything else that we're doing at this moment"". Also on Wednesday, the Panama-flagged cargo vessel SW North Wind I reported three explosions in the water nearby as it sailed through the Gulf of Aden, the UKMTO said. It added that the crew was safe following the incidents, which happened 57 nautical miles south of the Yemeni city of Aden, and the vessel was proceeding to the next port of call. In June, the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned cargo ship Tutor sank and one crew member was killed after the Houthis attacked it with a USV in the Red Sea."

The building hit, in the city of Nabatieh, was housing Syrian refugees, the Lebanese Health Minister, Firass Abiad, told the BBC. Israel said it had targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot, which was denied by the owner of the facility. In response Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political Lebanese group, fired a barrage of rockets, targeting a kibbutz in northern Israel and another on an Israeli military post. There were no casualties as a result of the first attack, while two Israeli soldiers were injured in the second, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.  Israel and Hezbollah have traded near daily fire across the border since the 7 October attack on Israel by Palestinian militants prompted an Israeli invasion of Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas. Tensions have escalated further in recent weeks after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, in Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Beirut. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has vowed to respond to the assassination. It comes as international mediators have urged Israel and Hamas to agree a ceasefire deal in upcoming talks, amid fears the war in Gaza could spiral into a regional conflict. Iran has dismissed calls from Western leaders to refrain from retaliating against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in its capital, Tehran, last month. But there are indications that Iran may have decided to delay its response amid the efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza. Mr Abiad, however, said Israel's actions suggested it had no interest in a deal. He also said that a woman and her two children were among the dead in Nabatieh, and that a further five people were in a critical condition. Hossain Tohmaz, the owner of one of the buildings hit, said it was a “100% civilian facility”, where people worked and lived. ""This is a hangar used for manufacturing iron, and that is a warehouse where we park trucks for loading goods like solar panels. The workers live and sleep on the top floor,"" he said. A few hours later, Hezbollah said it had fired Katyusha rockets at Ayelet HaShahar, a kibbutz north of the Sea of Galilee. The IDF said it had it had detected 55 launches from Lebanon, some of which had fallen in ""open areas"". ""Multiple fires were ignited in the area and Israel Fire and Rescue Services are currently operating at the scene to extinguish them,"" it wrote in an update on Telegram. A short while later, Hezbollah said it had attacked an Israeli military position in Marj. The IDF said one soldier had been severely injured and another lightly injured as a result of a projectile launched from Lebanon that had fallen on Misgav Am, which sits next to the Israel-Lebanon border. ""The soldiers were evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment and their families have been notified,"" it added. The strike is among the deadliest attacks in Lebanon in the current hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.

John Mason had the whip removed over the weekend after posting on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. He told BBC Good Morning Scotland  that the situation in Gaza was ""nothing like"" previous examples of genocide. Public Finance Minister Ivan McKee said Mr Mason's comments were offensive, inaccurate and not in line with SNP values.  SNP MSPs will meet to discuss a potential fixed suspension for Mr Mason when parliament reconvenes next month.  The withdrawal of the whip means Mr Mason must sit as an independent MSP until it is restored. His post was in response to criticism within the SNP of a meeting which took place between  External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson and Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky. The Times has reported that the SNP's Dalkeith branch has lodged a motion to the party conference  - which is being held in Edinburgh next week - calling for Mr Robertson to be suspended from cabinet for bringing the party into disrepute.  The outspoken backbencher. who represents Glasgow Shettleston, told Good Morning Scotland: “I completely stand by the tweet, which was making the point this is not genocide. “When we look at other examples of genocide, historically, it's nothing like what's happening in Gaza. “And if Israel wanted to commit genocide, you know, sadly, they could have killed an awful lot more people.” Mr Mason said Israel, as well as Jews in Scotland, felt “very much under threat”. He added: “I would like to see Scotland, the UK, acting more as a peacemaker, rather than cheering on either side.” Asked about losing the whip, Mr Mason responded: “Sometimes you have to do the right thing and just take the consequences.” The MSP, who also met Ms Grudsky, said it was Mr Robertson's role to meet people from all around the world, even those he may disagree with. He said: “We're not going to get any solution to this unless people actually talk to each other."" Mr Mason said he sought clarity on how the Israeli government was trying to resolve the conflict and what its aims were but was “disappointed” by the deputy ambassador’s answer. He added: “The SNP exists and is united for Scottish independence, and my hope is that we can focus on that.” Mr McKee said the party was right to remove the whip from Mr Mason over his comment. ""It's deeply offensive, it's hugely inaccurate, and it's not in line with the values of the SNP,"" he told Good Morning Scotland.  The SNP minister said Mr Mason should ""educate himself"" by reading the United Nations definition on genocide. He reiterated the Scottish government's calls for a ceasefire, humanitarian corridors and the recognition of the state of Palestine.  Mr McKee said Mr Robertson's meeting was held to “hold the Israeli government to account and to make clear long standing and continuing opposition to their behaviour”. However, he acknowledged that “many, many people in the party are very angry about the current situation"".  Mr McKee said there would be “no harm” in providing further clarity about what was said at the meeting. He added: “Angus Robertson is a very experienced politician, and I'm sure he'll be reflecting on what was and wasn't discussed at that meeting.” The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Following two days of US-backed talks in Qatar, President Biden said on Friday ""we are closer than we have ever been"".  And on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israeli negotiators had expressed ""cautious optimism"" about moving towards agreement on a deal. However, a senior Hamas official told the BBC earlier there had been no progress and mediators were ""selling illusions"".  The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and the freeing of some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead. In a recent joint statement, the US, Qatar and Egypt stated that they had presented a proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal that ""narrows the gaps"" between Israel and Hamas. Israel has said any ceasefire deal would require the release of the remaining hostages. Some have already been released, while others are thought to have died in Gaza. Relatives of hostages still in Gaza are calling the current negotiations as the ""last chance"" to get some of them out alive. After 10 months of war and thousands of casualties, there is overwhelming pressure for a breakthrough.  A wider regional conflict, in the event of talks between Israel and Hamas collapsing completely, is a distinct possibility and is something all of those involved are fearful of. The mediators said that the past two days of ceasefire discussions had been ""serious, constructive and conducted in a positive atmosphere"". Technical teams are expected to continue working over the coming days on the details of how to implement the proposed terms before senior government officials meet again in Cairo, hoping to reach an agreement on the terms set out in Doha. While the mediators' statement is clearly a positive development, there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire is agreed. This is not the first time the Mr Biden has said he thought a deal was close - and not everyone shares his cautious optimism.  Neither Hamas nor the Israeli government have been quite so upbeat in their responses. Israel says its position and core principles have remained unchanged and were ""well-known"". It accused Hamas of refusing to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages. Above all else, Israelis want to see the remaining hostages released but many are sceptical that is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s primary goal. He has insisted that a ""total victory"" over Hamas is his government’s priority. Meanwhile, Hamas’s new leader, Yaya Sinwar, continues to show few signs of compromise. Asked about President Biden’s statement, the senior Hamas official told the BBC ""what we have received from the mediators is very disappointing. There has been no progress"". Hamas is understood to have dropped its demand for a permanent ceasefire in favour of Mr Biden's proposal for a six-week pause in which an end to the war could be brokered. Mr Biden's ceasefire proposal also included the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the return of dead hostages' remains. The ""bridging proposal"" put forward by US, Egyptian and Qatari negotiators will be the subject of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s negotiations in the region and should form the basis for the next talks in Cairo at which all parties, including Hamas, are expected to attend. That proposal reportedly ""closes the remaining gaps"" between the two sides’ positions which could allow for “a rapid implementation of the agreement”. It might sound straightforward, but there are big obstacles to overcome and there is still absolutely no trust between senior Israeli or Hamas figures. They’re being dragged to the table - perhaps against their wishes - by others fearful of what could happen in the event of failure. Hamas and its allies are convinced the US administration is trying to buy more time.  If Iran attacks Israel, it will appear as if it is Hamas which undermined the negotiations.  Hamas does not hide its desire for Iran and Hezbollah to attack Israel and for the escalation to turn into a regional war. They believe a strong blow to Israel will weaken Mr Netanyahu and push him to accept a deal. For his part, Mr Biden warned ""no-one in the region should take actions to undermine this process"". Meanwhile, Israel's military operation in Gaza continues, with an air strike in the early hours of Saturday morning killing 15 people in the al-Zawaida neighbourhood of central Gaza, according to the Palestinian civil defence authority, a rescue service. Spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency nine children and three women were among the dead.  Israel has not commented directly. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday morning it had ""eliminated a number of terrorists"" in central Gaza, including one that had fired at Israeli forces operating in the area. The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for several blocks in northern Khan Younis and Deir Balah - further shrinking the humanitarian zone in which  thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. Israel said the blocks had become dangerous for civilians ""due to significant acts of terrorism"" and the firing of rockets and mortars towards Israel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said: ""Once again, fear spreads as families have nowhere to go."" Pressing the need for a ceasefire deal is the circulation of the polio virus - which can spread through faecal matter - is now circulating inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in Gaza. ""Let’s be clear: The ultimate vaccine for polio is peace and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62305qx946o,I heard years of Grenfell testimony. Here's why the disaster could have been prevented,Opportunities missed and warnings unheeded - what the public inquiry into the fire has been told.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:20.320799,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"There are many moments where you could begin the story of Grenfell Tower. One is in 1972, when a section of cramped west London terraced streets in Notting Dale had just been torn down. The vision was to replace them with an entirely new community. The Lancaster West Estate would have three blocks, each leading to a central 24-storey concrete tower - Grenfell. Early plans included shops, offices, a swimming pool and gardens. But plans for these amenities were quickly abandoned. Just five years after Grenfell Tower opened in 1974, the early optimism had faded. Residents were already complaining about vandalism, broken lifts and lights, and of the estate feeling impersonal. More than 30 years later, some residents spoke of slum-like conditions. Then a new refurbishment began. It promised lower heating bills, new boilers, a completely new look for the building. It was this refurbishment that would cover the tower’s external walls with combustible materials and lead to the catastrophic fire that killed 72 people in 2017. Next week, the public inquiry into the disaster will produce its final report, setting out what led to the worst residential fire since World War Two - one the inquiry has heard was both foreseeable and preventable. I’ve been covering that inquiry since 2018, listening to hundreds, possibly thousands of hours of evidence about the layers of opportunities missed and warnings unheeded at every level. This is a story of corporate deceit, government deregulation drives and a construction industry in a race to the bottom. Dr Barbara Lane is a fire safety specialist who was one of the inquiry’s main expert witnesses, giving days of evidence. She’s upfront and straight-talking, often telling the barristers why their questions were wrong. In person, though, when she talks about her experiences inside the block in the fire’s aftermath, her manner is completely different. Quietly, she recalls the darkness, the black smoke-stained walls, a half-burnt bedroom where only a cot remained. What struck her was the humanity of it, she says: “What the humans went through.” To understand how a refurbishment could have created the possibility of such a disaster, we have to look at what underpinned all that work - the building regulations. When Grenfell was constructed, those regulations were set by an act of parliament. Grenfell: Building a Disaster For the past six years, a public inquiry has heard evidence about the worst residential fire in UK peacetime. Kate Lamble has reported on it from the beginning. She examines what created the conditions for a disaster that was both foreseeable and preventable. Listen on BBC Sounds In the 1980s, however, Margaret Thatcher wanted to reduce government intervention. Regulations stopped listing precise rules, simply describing instead what the end result should be. The external walls of a building, the regulations now stated, should simply offer “adequate resistance” to fire - a standard the public inquiry has already concluded Grenfell Tower did not meet. How to achieve this was contained in government guidance, not regulations. Dr Lane says this shift gave the industry a false confidence to not really care as much as they should about safety. As early as the 1990s, there were signs of weakness in the new guidance. It suggested that cladding panels should meet a certain fire safety standard known as Class 0. But materials which met that standard were soon involved in fires. On 11 June 1999, a dropped cigarette started a fire in Garnock Court, a 14-storey block in Irvine, Ayrshire. News reports described it igniting like matchwood. One man was killed. The corner flats had been surrounded by plastic cladding that should have met the Class 0 standard. Brian Donohoe, the then-local MP, says he pushed for all combustible cladding to be banned and removed. His Labour colleagues, then in government, did not agree. One secretary of state, he says, told him “it would cost millions”. A parliamentary select committee recommended that all cladding on high-rise buildings should either be entirely non-combustible, or put through large-scale fire tests to prove it wasn’t a risk. These tests were introduced, but Class 0 remained in the guidance. England and Wales continued to be a market for combustible cladding. Garnock Court wasn’t the only warning. In 2009, flames at Lakanal House, a south London tower block, spread rapidly into combustible panels outside. Six people were killed. Four years later, a coroner called for a review of the building regulation guidance. The government agreed to do this by 2016 or 2017. But by the time of the Grenfell fire, this work had not begun, despite repeated demands from MPs in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fire Safety. This was a period of snap elections and referendums. The minister responsible for building regulations changed three times in as many years. Ministers also say they were not briefed on the importance of the Lakanal House fire. Statistics also showed fewer people were dying in fires. One minister told the inquiry they took comfort from that that there was no urgent problem. At the public inquiry, one junior civil servant admitted there were a number of occasions “where I could have potentially prevented this happening”. Brian Martin advised ministers on the part of the building regulation guidance that covered fire safety. Over the years, he was given a series of warnings about the use of combustible materials on high-rise residential buildings. After a cladding fire in Dubai in 2015, Mr Martin was approached by industry figures who told him that the combustible products involved in the blaze - the very type of cladding later installed on Grenfell Tower - were being sold in the UK. Mr Martin has acknowledged he did not escalate that warning to his bosses. “I struggle to come to terms with why I didn't do that,“ he told the inquiry. We should remember the 2010s were the era of slashing red tape, of health and safety culture ""gone mad"". According to Mr Martin: ""Regulation was a dirty word."" Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, in 2011 a policy of “one in, one out” was adopted. Ministers could not introduce a regulation unless they abolished one too. By 2016, under the Conservatives, that became “one in, three out”. Brian Martin and his superiors have said they understood fire safety was not exempt from the government’s deregulation drive - something ministers have strongly denied. The Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities says it has since taken a number of actions, including banning combustible materials on high-rise buildings. It was the view that first attracted Marcio Gomes to his 21st-floor flat in Grenfell, he tells me. On New Year’s Eve, he would invite friends to watch the fireworks. He remembers when talk started of refurbishing the building. Posters showed how it might look with metallic-looking cladding fitted. Residents were asked which colour they’d prefer, which finish? Fire safety was never discussed. At the public inquiry, there have been questions about how each of the materials installed on Grenfell were tested. The cladding was made of thin sheets of aluminium with a core of combustible plastic. The inquiry has already found it to be the main cause of the spread of the fire. It was made in France by a company called Arconic and came with a certificate that said a “standard panel” met the fire safety standards contained in the government guidance. However, Arconic suggested their materials could be cut in two different ways. The first option, flat panels, had achieved the European fire standards described. The other option, cassettes, where the material had been bent and folded, had not. In fire tests, these performed “spectacularly” worse.  It was the bent cassettes that were fitted on to Grenfell Tower. Arconic received their certificate by only providing the results of the successful test on the flat panels, not the failed test on the cassettes. At the public inquiry, Claude Schmidt, the managing director of the company’s French office, accepted this could be seen as a “misleading half-truth”, but denied information was deliberately withheld. Arconic told us it acknowledges the part it played in supplying a material involved in the fire. But it says responsibility for fire safety compliance does not rest with it as the supplier, but with those who selected it for use. Ed Daffarn moved into Grenfell in 2001. In the following decade he describes the building falling into a period of managed decline. He welcomed the idea of a multi-million pound refurbishment. The initial design work was given to Studio E, architects who had worked on a nearby school and leisure centre. Only they had never clad a high-rise building before. A competitive process legally required for large expensive projects was avoided because Studio E deliberately deferred part of their fee - bringing down the upfront costs. At a meeting with the Tenant Management Organisation that ran the building on behalf of the local council, Ed Daffarn asked if the architects had experience with tower blocks and if not: “Why are we using them?” He says he never received an answer. During the refurbishment, Mr Daffarn says he can’t remember “a single meeting where I felt that our views or what we wanted was being listened to”. Many residents joined action groups to raise concerns about a range of fire safety issues including out-of-date equipment. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has acknowledged residents were not listened to as much as they should have been. The lead architect on the Grenfell refurbishment, Bruce Sounes, told the inquiry he did not familiarise himself with building regulations on fire safety. Nor did Studio E check the suitability of the materials they specified. At Studio E’s request, a company called Exova wrote three fire safety strategies for Grenfell Tower. All three stated the refurbishment would have no adverse effect on external fire spread. None even acknowledged the building would be clad. Exova staff have said they thought the architects would ask them to look at the cladding if necessary. With the initial design completed, the refurbishment was handed to a construction firm, Rydon, which became legally responsible for the design and build. Rydon’s bid had been lower than their nearest competitor - but still £800,000 over budget. In cases like this, what commonly happens next is a process known as “value engineering” - finding ways to cut costs without affecting performance. Two days after Rydon was officially appointed as the contractor, it sent details of proposed savings to the Tenant Management Organisation which ran the building. Non-combustible metal cladding, which the architects had preferred, would be replaced with a cheaper alternative, saving nearly £400,000. Based only on looks, the council’s planning department chose cassette panels, the most dangerous form. This cladding, with its combustible plastic core, was the primary cause of the fire’s spread. As is common in construction, Rydon hired sub-contractors, who then often hired their own. Almost all have argued they did not hold ultimate responsibility for checking the work for fire safety, pointing instead to another firm they presumed was doing it. The lead counsel at the public inquiry called this a “merry-go-round of buck-passing”. In 2016, the local council’s building control department signed off the refurbishment. The council accepts it should not have done so. The tower was transformed, but residents immediately spotted problems. “There were massive gaps above, below and beside the windows,” Ed Daffarn says. In the early hours of the 14 June 2017, those gaps would fill with smoke. The first fire engine arrived at Grenfell within five minutes. Crews saw wispy smoke and an orange glow. To them, this seemed normal. There were around five fires a week in high-rise flats in London. But this fire would quickly become something else, as it spread out of the window and climbed up the outside of the building through the combustible cladding and insulation. Having watched dozens of firefighters give evidence to the inquiry, it’s hard to think of even one who recognised what they were watching was a cladding fire. Front-line firefighting staff hadn’t been trained about the risks of fire spreading across the outside of a high-rise building. That is even though Andy Roe, who now leads the London Fire Brigade (LFB), accepts his organisation knew of these risks. ”It's fair to say that we didn't train people adequately enough,“ he says. He accepts this was a failure of the organisation’s obligation to its staff. Still, Mr Roe thinks it would have been very hard to foresee the extremity of the Grenfell fire. For more than an hour and a half, the LFB operated on the principle of “stay put” - advising residents they would be safest to remain in their flats until help arrived. This policy relies on flames and smoke being contained in a flat for at least 60 minutes, giving firefighters time to reach them. But at Grenfell, flames climbed 19 floors in just 18 minutes. Mr Roe recognises residents were advised to stay put for too long and that advice would have had an impact on residents’ decision-making that night. “Stay put” is still used by the LFB but it has now trained its crews to evacuate when necessary. Ed Daffarn was woken by a neighbour’s smoke alarm around 01:10 on 14 June 2017. When he opened his door, he was met with a wall of smoke. The spread of this smoke was aided by something that seems small, even insignificant: automatic door-closing mechanisms. These are meant to keep smoke inside a flat if a resident has to run outside to safety. But at Grenfell, not every door closed behind people as they fled. Workmen had removed some door-closers during repair work - including one flat on Ed Daffarn’s floor. He’d complained about it himself. Both the Tenant Management Organisation and Grenfell’s owners, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, were aware of this issue. The inquiry has been told a plan was put together to regularly check door-closers. But the idea was rejected. The council told us that it could and should have done more to keep its residents safe before the fire. It told the BBC it was wrong to tell the Tenant Management Organisation there should not be an inspection programme. On the night of the fire, flames quickly reached Ed’s neighbour’s flat, the one without an automatic door-closer. The resident ran out, leaving the door open, and smoke poured out into the hallway where Ed would find himself. Ed became lost in the corridor. As he panicked, a firefighter grabbed him and pulled him into the stairwell. These, then, are the layers of missed opportunities, the dozens of chances over decades for someone to step in, to ask a question, to change history. At the end of the hearings, the lead counsel to the inquiry said it will “be able to conclude with confidence that each and every one of the deaths that occurred in Grenfell Tower on 14 June 2017 was avoidable”. For me, Grenfell also reveals a series of unspoken truths about the British system.  How safety was regarded as, at best, not as a vote-winner; and at worst as an obstruction to the economy. How regulation was viewed as guidance to be bent. An inherent lack of curiosity - a presumption that someone else would check, that something that bad couldn’t happen here. More than 3,000 high- and mid-rise buildings across England are still being monitored because they have unsafe cladding. The recommendations made next week will attempt to ensure such a disaster can never happen again. As always the government will have no obligation to carry these out. Nor is there a formal process to monitor what they reject or why. It is another opportunity for change. One we may yet reflect on after future fires.

""We are closer than we’ve ever been,"" the US president said following the latest round of talks, adding he was sending his secretary of state to Israel to continue the ""intensive efforts to conclude this agreement"". However, a senior Hamas official told the BBC there had been no progress and mediators were ""selling illusions"".  Israel said it ""appreciates the efforts of the US and the mediators to dissuade Hamas from its refusal to a hostage release deal"". The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and the freeing of some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead. In a recent joint statement, the US, Qatar and Egypt stated that they had presented a proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal that ""narrows the gaps"" between Israel and Hamas. Israel has said any ceasefire deal would require the release of the remaining hostages. Some have already been released, while others are thought to have died in Gaza. Relatives of hostages still in Gaza are calling the current negotiations as the ""last chance"" to get some of them out alive. After 10 months of war and thousands of casualties, there is overwhelming pressure for a breakthrough.  A wider regional conflict, in the event of talks between Israel and Hamas collapsing completely, is a distinct possibility and is something all of those involved are fearful of. The mediators said that the past two days of ceasefire discussions had been ""serious, constructive and conducted in a positive atmosphere"". Technical teams are expected to continue working over the coming days on the details of how to implement the proposed terms before senior government officials meet again in Cairo, hoping to reach an agreement on the terms set out in Doha. While the mediators' statement is clearly a positive development, there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire is agreed. This is not the first time the Mr Biden has said he thought a deal was close - and not everyone shares his cautious optimism.  Neither Hamas nor the Israeli government have been quite so upbeat in their responses. Israel says its position and core principles have remained unchanged and were ""well-known"". It accused Hamas of refusing to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages. Above all else, Israelis want to see the remaining hostages released but many are sceptical that is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s primary goal. He has insisted that a ""total victory"" over Hamas is his government’s priority. Meanwhile, Hamas’s new leader, Yaya Sinwar, continues to show few signs of compromise. Asked about President Biden’s statement, the senior Hamas official told the BBC ""what we have received from the mediators is very disappointing. There has been no progress"". Hamas is understood to have dropped its demand for a permanent ceasefire in favour of Mr Biden's proposal for a six-week pause in which an end to the war could be brokered. Mr Biden's ceasefire proposal also included the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the return of dead hostages' remains. The ""bridging proposal"" put forward by US, Egyptian and Qatari negotiators will be the subject of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s negotiations in the region and should form the basis for the next talks in Cairo at which all parties, including Hamas, are expected to attend. That proposal reportedly ""closes the remaining gaps"" between the two sides’ positions which could allow for “a rapid implementation of the agreement”. It might sound straightforward, but there are big obstacles to overcome and there is still absolutely no trust between senior Israeli or Hamas figures. They’re being dragged to the table - perhaps against their wishes - by others fearful of what could happen in the event of failure. Hamas and its allies are convinced the US administration is trying to buy more time.  If Iran attacks Israel, it will appear as if it is Hamas which undermined the negotiations.  Hamas does not hide its desire for Iran and Hezbollah to attack Israel and for the escalation to turn into a regional war. They believe a strong blow to Israel will weaken Mr Netanyahu and push him to accept a deal. For his part, Mr Biden warned ""no-one in the region should take actions to undermine this process"". Meanwhile, Israel's military operation in Gaza continues, with an air strike in the early hours of Saturday morning killing 15 people in the al-Zawaida neighbourhood of central Gaza, according to the Palestinian civil defence authority, a rescue service. Spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency nine children and three women were among the dead.  Israel has not commented directly. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday morning it had ""eliminated a number of terrorists"" in central Gaza, including one that had fired at Israeli forces operating in the area. The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for several blocks in northern Khan Younis and Deir Balah - further shrinking the humanitarian zone in which  thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. Israel said the blocks had become dangerous for civilians ""due to significant acts of terrorism"" and the firing of rockets and mortars towards Israel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said: ""Once again, fear spreads as families have nowhere to go."" Pressing the need for a ceasefire deal is the circulation of the polio virus - which can spread through faecal matter - is now circulating inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in Gaza. ""Let’s be clear: The ultimate vaccine for polio is peace and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jpzqxzwp0o,"Time for Gaza ceasefire deal is now, says Lammy",It comes as a fresh round of ceasefire talks have begun in Doha amid fears of an all-out regional war.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:20.529336,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The time for a Gaza ceasefire deal is ""now"", Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said on a visit to Israel with his French counterpart Stéphane Séjourné.  In the first joint UK-France visit in more than 10 years, the pair met Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Minister of Strategic Affairs of Israel Ron Dermer, as well as visiting the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It comes as a fresh round of ceasefire talks have begun in Doha, with negotiators from the US, Qatar and Egypt meeting an Israeli delegation.  There are fears of an all-out regional war involving Iran following the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Western countries have been urging Iran to refrain from retaliating against Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the assassination.  The Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon is also threatening to retaliate over Israel’s killing of one of its top commanders in an air strike in Beirut. It is hoped that a new ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages would calm tensions in the region.  Speaking to reporters, Mr Lammy said Israeli ministers had told him ""they hope we are on the cusp of a deal"".  He added: ""The time for a deal for those hostages to be returned, for aid to get in in the quantities that are necessary in Gaza, and for the fighting to stop, is now."" The US said there had been a ""promising start"" to talks but ""there remains a lot of work to do"".  Hamas has said it will not participate in the negotiations for now, although mediators are said to be relaying messages to the armed group’s officials based there. The group - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - has claimed Israel has added new conditions to a previous proposal that had US and international support.  Earlier Mr Lammy warned of a ""dangerous moment for the Middle East"".  ""The risk of the situation spiralling out of control is rising. Any Iranian attack would have devastating consequences for the region,"" he said.  French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné said: ""It's never too late for peace.  ""We must at all costs avoid a regional war, which would have terrible consequences. We must secure a ceasefire agreement and the release of the all the hostages."" Mr Lammy also responded to events in the occupied West Bank overnight, where a Palestinian man was shot dead as dozens of Israeli settlers attacked a village.  ""The scenes overnight of the burning and torching of buildings, of the Molotov cocktails thrown at cars, of the widespread rampage and chasing of people from their homes is abhorrent and I condemn it in the strongest of terms,"" he said.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he took the riots ""seriously"" and promised those responsible for any criminal acts would be ""caught and prosecuted"".  Mr Lammy said he hoped the swift investigation promised by Mr Netanyahu would ensure those responsible would be brought to justice. It is the latest in the series of attacks by extremist settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where there has been a spike in violence since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Thursday that at least 40,005 people had been killed in the territory since then.  The figure, which does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, is often disputed by the Israeli government but is broadly accepted by UN agencies."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m0ekn3jkjo,Gaza ceasefire mediators in bid to ‘narrow gaps’,"The US, Qatar and Egypt say talks will resume in Cairo next week with the aim of agreeing a deal.",16 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:20.619157,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Mediators in talks on a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal say they have presented a proposal which “narrows the gaps” between Israel and Hamas. Qatar, Egypt and the US said in a joint statement that the past two days of discussions in Doha were “serious, constructive and conducted in a positive atmosphere”. Senior officials would meet again in Cairo before the end of next week with the aim of finalising an agreement, they added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Israel on Saturday to intensify the diplomatic efforts. US President Joe Biden declared that “we are closer than we’ve ever been” to a ceasefire, but a senior Hamas official expressed scepticism. At the very least, this is a statement that buys more time, given the tensions in the region and the threats of retaliation against Israel from Iran for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut last month. Any sign of progress in the Qatar talks was regarded as essential by governments desperate to avoid the war in Gaza spiralling into an all-out regional conflict. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and the freeing of some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held, 39 of whom are presumed dead. The mediators' statement said the US had presented on Friday “a proposal that narrows the gaps between the parties and is consistent with the principles set out by President Biden on 31 May”. Technical teams will continue to work over the coming days on the details of implementation before senior government officials meet again in Cairo, hoping to reach an agreement on the terms set out in Doha. The statement ended by citing the American, Qatari and Egyptian leaders as warning that there was “no more time to waste and no excuses for further delay”. “The path is now clear to achieve this outcome, save lives, bring relief to the people of Gaza, and calm regional tensions,” it added. Later, Mr Biden told reporters at the White House: ""I don't want to jinx anything... we may have something. But we're not there yet.” In a later statement, the US president added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken was travelling to the Middle East in part ""to underscore that with the comprehensive ceasefire and hostage release deal now in sight, no-one in the region should take actions to undermine this process"". While the mediators' statement is clearly a positive development, there is still a long way to go before a ceasefire is agreed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office was more cautious than Mr Biden, saying he appreciated the efforts to “dissuade Hamas from its refusal on a deal that would release the hostages”. ""Israel's core principles are well known to the US and the mediators, and Israel hopes their pressure will lead Hamas to accept the terms of 27 May, so the details of the agreement can be implemented,"" it added. A senior figure from Hamas - which did not participate in the talks, but was in contact with Qatari and Egyptian officials - told the BBC: “What the movement’s leadership was informed of today regarding the results of the Doha ceasefire meetings does not include a commitment to implement what was agreed upon on 2 July.” The first phase of the deal outlined by President Biden, based on Israel’s 27 May proposal, would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. Before the talks resumed on Thursday afternoon, a Hamas official had said the key sticking points included Israel’s demand that it had full control over the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, and that displaced people returning to northern Gaza be screened at the Israeli-controlled Netzarim corridor that effectively divides the territory in two. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC after Friday’s talks ended that Israel had “shown flexibility on one outstanding issue - its veto of the names of some Palestinian prisoners”. But, they said, it had “insisted on maintaining a military presence at the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim checkpoint during the first phase of the deal”, and “stipulated that those returning to northern Gaza would be inspected”. Earlier, the UN made an urgent appeal for two seven-day pauses in the fighting in Gaza starting later this month to allow the vaccination of more than 640,000 Palestinian children against polio. In recent weeks, traces of the poliovirus - which is spread through faecal matter - have been detected in sewage samples collected in the southern city of Khan Younis and central town of Deir al-Balah. That means the virus is now circulating inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. ""Let’s be clear: The ultimate vaccine for polio is peace and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said. “But in any case, a polio pause is a must. It is impossible to conduct a polio vaccination campaign with war raging all over."" Earlier, the Israeli military issued a new evacuation order for several blocks in northern Khan Younis and Deir Balah, further shrinking the humanitarian zone. It said the blocks had become dangerous for civilians “due to significant acts of terrorism"" and the firing of rockets and mortars towards Israel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said: “Once again, fear spreads as families have nowhere to go. People remain trapped in an endless nightmare of death and destruction on a staggering scale.”"

He said people had for months been asking him to call off the concert in solidarity with the Sudanese people ""and to boycott doing business in the UAE for the role they are playing in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis in the region"". The rapper cited the UAE's reported support for the Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been battling the Sudanese army. ""Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there,"" he said in a post on Instagram. The UAE government described the allegations over its involvement in the Sudan conflict as ""baseless and unfounded"", and meant ""to divert attention from the ongoing fighting and humanitarian catastrophe"". ""UAE reiterates its call for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. The warring parties must stop fighting and work towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict through dialogue,"" it said in a statement. Sudan's ambassador to the UN, Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed, has said that the UAE's financial and military support to the RSF was the ""main reason behind this protracted war"". Since the fighting began in April last year, thousands of people have been killed and 10 million forced to flee their homes. The war has sparked the country's worst hunger levels on record, according to the UN-accredited Integrated food security Phase Classification (IPC). Both sides have been blamed for atrocities but the RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide against the non-Arabic population in parts of the western region of Darfur which it largely controls. It has denied the accusation, blaming local militias. A number of talks aimed at ending the 16-month war have so far failed, with the rival factions still fighting for control of the country, worsening the humanitarian crisis. Macklemore said in his statement on Saturday that he took the decision because ""the current situation in Sudan is urgent, horrific and it's going largely unnoticed globally"". It was also inspired by the Israeli-Hamas war happening in Gaza, he says, noting that the plight of the Palestinian people ""has woken the world up"". The Grammy-winning artist's latest song, Hind's Hall, pays tribute to a girl who was killed in Gaza. He has in the past released music addressing social issues, including drug addiction, consumerism and gay rights. He says he is not judging other stars who perform in the UAE, which often hosts major international artists and sporting events. ""But I do ask the question to my peers scheduled to play in Dubai: If we used our platforms to mobilise collective liberation, what could we accomplish?"" he added.

Earlier this month, Clive Lewis, who represents Norwich South, claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called ""rising Islamophobia"" in the UK. In response to Mr Lewis's comment, which he made in a post on X, the campaign group Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) called for him to be suspended from the party. Now Mr Lewis has said attempts to ""shut down and silence"" politicians is a ""dangerous path"" and ""fundamentally wrong"". In a new post on X, he said: ""Combatting antisemitism and advocating for Palestinian human rights and addressing broader Islamophobia, are not mutually exclusive goals. ""We have a responsibility as politicians to ensure all minorities feel safe here in the UK and to advocate for the upholding of human rights abroad. ""Differences of opinion as how best to do this should, of course, always be encouraged. But attempting to shut down and silence those seeking to highlight these issues is a dangerous path and one that is fundamentally, wrong."" LAAS made an official complaint to UK Labour over Mr Lewis's original post, claiming it was ""highly irresponsible"" and breached the official definition of antisemitism. However, it is understood no further action would be taken by the party, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. A Labour spokesperson previously said all complaints were treated seriously and ""thoroughly assessed in line with its rules and procedures"". In his original post, Mr Lewis had written: ""The link between the daily inhumanity being metted [sic] out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. ""The inhumanity being shown to one is giving 'permission' for the other. These actions diminish us all."" He also linked to a Guardian newspaper article about how dozens of people were reported dead after an Israeli attack on a school in Gaza. Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. Alex Hearn, LAAS co-director, described the comments as ""extremely irresponsible"" and a ""conspiracy fantasy"". ""I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20rxr3pr50o,Risk of regional war hangs over Gaza ceasefire talks,"The US believes a deal could help calm the Middle East, but do Israel and Hamas's leader want one?",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.399844,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"If the leaks to local papers are true, even Israel’s defence chiefs are urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a deal and agree a ceasefire in Gaza. Since Israel’s negotiators last made the trip to the Qatari capital for talks, the stakes - and the pressures - have only grown. In Israel, the relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are calling this the “last chance” to get some of them out alive. In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry - whose figures have been used by the UN and Israel in the past - says the number of people killed in Israeli operations there since the war began has now passed 40,000. And the US is moving a second aircraft carrier and a missile-equipped submarine to the region, after threats from Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, to attack Israel in response to the assassinations of key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders last month. There is no lack of incentives for a deal. And no lack of pressure either. The US believes a truce in Gaza could help calm the entire region. Visiting Lebanon on Wednesday, US envoy Amos Hochstein said a deal would also help create the conditions for a deal in a growing cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. “We have to take advantage of this window for diplomatic action and diplomatic solutions,” he said. “That time is now.” His boss, President Joe Biden, appears to be managing expectations. “It’s getting harder,” he told reporters in New Orleans this week, adding, “I’m not giving up.” With so much to gain, why are hopes for these talks so thin? First, the red herring: the declaration by Hamas that it would not send a delegation to the meeting is unlikely to have a major impact. Negotiations have always been indirect, shuttle diplomacy - Hamas representatives do not talk directly to Israel or the US. And the group’s main international base is Doha, where talks are taking place, and where Qatari and Egyptian negotiators have an open channel of communication with them. The real issue, according to former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin, is a lack of motivation by the Israeli and Hamas leaders. “The United States, Egypt and Qatar have decided that they need to change the rules of the game: put an ultimatum on the table, put a bridging proposal on the table, and tell Hamas and Israel that they have to do it,” he said. “[But] it's obviously that the mediators want the agreement more than the parties do, and that's a big part of the problem.” Chen Avigdori’s wife and 12-year-old daughter were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas in the 7 October attacks on Israel, when another 1,200 people were killed. The pair were released in November and he’s now campaigning to get the remaining 111 hostages out. “I think they are both holding it up,” he said. “I think Sinwar doesn't really care about his own people. But I think that Mr Netanyahu has skipped some opportunities that Israel already had to sign the deal.” For Yahya Sinwar - one of the masterminds of the 7 October attacks, who became Hamas’s political leader following Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination in Tehran - some analysts believe the calculation may be changing. “I think Sinwar wants to save himself and save Hamas, because they haven't been destroyed totally, but militarily they've been defeated and it could turn into a rout,” said Chuck Freilich of Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “Netanyahu is in a more difficult position, because if there's a deal, there's a very good chance that he'll lose his coalition.” Benjamin Netanyahu has so far held fast to certain red lines - including giving Israel the right to restart the war if later talks on troop withdrawal and prisoner exchanges fail. Mr Netanyahu’s far-right allies have vowed to pull out of the government if, for example, he agrees to release large numbers of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, in return for the hostages. The sticking points facing negotiators are substantial. But proposals to bridge some of them have been widely reported in the Israeli media. For instance, Mr Netanyahu’s insistence that Israeli forces must remain on Gaza’s border with Egypt, to stop armed groups smuggling in weapons, has been countered with solutions involving technology and the involvement of allies on the ground. Hamas has accused Israel of bringing in new demands and said that the time for negotiation is over.  It has said it is ready to implement the terms it agreed to last month. Israel denies it is adding new conditions, describing them as an attempt to clarify what was already agreed. The deal’s international mediators – the US, Qatar and Egypt – certainly have some leverage over the two sides, but it may not be enough to force an agreement if the parties themselves don’t want one. “The US and Qatar can push, they can cajole, they can offer inducements, they can offer to help create the technical solutions,” says Chuck Freilich. “But in the end, it's up to the specific leaders.” Ultimately, the fate of these talks, of Gaza, of the hostages – even the fate of the region itself – will rest on the calculations of two shrewd survivors; two warring men."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw32jj4973o,High-stakes Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks resume in Doha,A deal is considered key to stopping the war from spiralling into an all-out regional conflict.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.496953,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The US says there has been a “promising start” to the new round of talks in Doha on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the Gaza Strip, as the number of Palestinians reported killed in the war between Israel and Hamas surpassed 40,000. An agreement is seen as key to stopping the 10-month conflict spiralling into an all-out regional war involving Iran, but expectations of a breakthrough are low. White House spokesman John Kirby said “there remains a lot of work to do” to resolve gaps in the implementation of the framework agreement. Hamas has said it will not participate in the indirect negotiations in Doha for now, although mediators are said to be relaying messages to the armed group’s officials based there. It has called for a roadmap based on a proposal outlined by the US president and has accused Israel's prime minister of adding new conditions, which he has denied. Israeli media report that the country’s negotiating team has been given a slightly expanded mandate, while the relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are calling this the “last chance” to get some of them out alive. The mediators face a number of potential sticking points, including control of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt and the return of displaced Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza. The talks were suspended after Hamas's political leader and chief negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran at the end of July. Iran has vowed to retaliate against Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, raising fears of a wider escalation. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said on Thursday that at least 40,005 people had been killed in the territory since then, which the UN human rights chief described as a “grim milestone for the world”. The figure, which does not make a distinction between combatants and civilians, is often disputed by the Israeli government but is broadly accepted by UN agencies. The Israeli military said it had “eliminated over 17,000 terrorists”. It has also reported that 330 of its troops have been killed since the ground invasion began. Israel's delegation to the Doha talks reportedly included the directors of its Mossad foreign intelligence agency and Shin Bet domestic security service, David Barnier and Ronen Bar, as well as the Israeli military’s hostages chief, Nitzan Alon. CIA director William Burns joined them, along with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel. Qatari and Egyptian officials were also “mediating with Hamas” as part of the process, according to the US state department. After the start of the discussions on Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that they were likely to continue on Friday because of the complexity of the agreement. Mr Kirby stressed that they were not having a debate over the broad framework of the deal. “We're at a point where it's generally accepted. Where the gaps are in the execution of the deal, the individual muscle-movements that go with putting the deal in place,"" he explained, without providing any details. He added: “The remaining obstacles can be overcome, and we must bring this process to a close.” The first phase of the proposed deal outlined by US President Joe Biden at the end of May would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains A senior official in Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - told the BBC on Wednesday that it would not attend the Doha talks, even though its political leadership is almost entirely based in the Qatari capital. He claimed that Israel had “added new conditions and reneged on its previous agreement”, including demanding that it maintain full control over the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, and that displaced people returning to northern Gaza be screened to ensure they are unarmed civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement on Tuesday saying the claim that he had added new conditions was “false”, describing them instead as “essential clarifications to help implement” the initial proposal. ""Enough is enough, we want to get back to our homes in Gaza City. Every hour, a family is getting killed or a house getting bombed,"" Aya, a displaced Palestinian woman sheltering in Deir al-Balah, told Reuters news agency. ""We are hopeful this time. Either it's this time or never I am afraid.” The families of the remaining Israeli hostages also believe time is running out, and many took part in a march through Tel Aviv at which they chanted “seal the deal”. Israel says 111 hostages are still being held by Hamas, 39 of whom are presumed dead. It came as the spokesman of Hamas’s military wing released a statement providing further details about how he said an Israeli male hostage had been shot and killed by a Hamas guard. Abu Ubaida said the guard had “acted in a retaliatory manner, against instructions, after he received information that his two children were martyred” by Israeli forces. The Israeli military said in response to the group’s initial statement about the killing on Monday that it did not have any information that allowed it to confirm or deny the claim. Hamas also posted on Thursday a photo showing the body of another man, who it said had been killed in “an unfortunate incident”. The Israeli military said the image showed “a hostage who was murdered and whose body was recovered” by troops in November. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum identified him as Ofir Tzarfati and cited his mother, Richelle, as saying: ""What is important is that the delegation succeeds and does everything to come back with a deal. Everyone needs to come home, now.” In addition to halting a war and freeing hostages, the US and others see a ceasefire deal as a way to deter Iran from retaliating against Israel for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, who has been succeeded by Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds of the 7 October attack. The Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement has also vowed to respond to the killing of a senior commander in an Israeli air strike in Beirut. The Israeli military blamed the latter for a rocket attack that killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel has warned Iran that it would “exact a heavy price for any aggression”, while Iran has insisted “a punitive response to an aggressor is a legal right”. Mr Kirby said the US and its allies  had to take seriously the “rhetoric coming out of Tehran”. “I can't sit here and tell you for sure that that there's been a decision to change their mind,” he said. “A few days ago, we had information... that an attack could come with little or no warning, and certainly could come in coming days, and we have to be ready for it.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623zkwd04qo,Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers torch West Bank village,The Israeli prime minister says he views the incident with “utmost severity”.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.587747,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A Palestinian man was shot dead as dozens of Israeli settlers attacked a village in the north of the occupied West Bank overnight, setting fire to houses and cars, Palestinian officials say. The settlers - some wearing masks - also threw rocks and Molotov cocktails in the village of Jit, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that one was arrested. The Palestinian health ministry said Rashid Sedda, 22, was killed by gunfire from the settlers and another man was seriously wounded in what it condemned as an act of “organised state terrorism”. The IDF said it was looking into the reports of a fatality. Israel’s prime minister said he viewed the incident with “utmost severity”. It is the latest in the series of attacks by extremist settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where there has been a spike in violence since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October and the ensuing war in Gaza. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Footage shared on social media showed cars and houses ablaze following the deadly rampage in Jit on Thursday night. As he inspected the damage to his home on Friday morning, Ibrahim al-Seda told the BBC he had been sitting outside his home with relatives after the sunset Maghrib prayer when he heard a crash. “We looked out and saw seven, eight, maybe 10 settlers. Two cars were set on fire,” he said. “My children ran outside, and we grabbed the hose to try to put out the fire on the cars. But the water wasn’t enough; we couldn’t extinguish the flames. Then they started throwing rocks from above.” “The people from the town came to defend us and our neighbourhood. Then more settlers arrived, this time armed. They started shooting.” He added: “Young men who were defending us from above the wall threw stones to protect themselves. We were outnumbered. There were probably around 100 settlers by the end. The people who were down below had to run away because they couldn’t stand against the gunfire. “The settlers took control of the area. They set two more cars on fire and prevented us from going outside because they would shoot anyone who tried.” Mr Seda said Israeli soldiers arrived “about an hour later” and that they fired shots into the air but “didn’t intervene much at that point just to stop what was going on”. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medics had treated a Palestinian villager who was shot in the chest and rushed him to the Rafida Government Hospital in the nearby city of Nablus, where his condition was described as critical, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Rashid Sedda’s body was also taken there. In a statement, the IDF said its forces and Border Police officers were despatched to the village ""within minutes"" of receiving reports of violence. They fired into the air to disperse the crowds and “remove[d] the Israeli civilians”, it added. One person was arrested and transferred to the police for questioning, it added. The IDF said it had opened a joint investigation with the Shin Bet domestic security service and the police following what it called “this serious incident”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that he took “seriously the riots that took place this evening"" and promised that “those responsible for any criminal act will be caught and prosecuted"". President Isaac Herzog wrote in a post on X: ""This is an extreme minority that harms the law-abiding community of settlers and the settlement as a whole and in the name and status of Israel in the world during a particularly sensitive and difficult period. The US, Israel's main ally, also issued a condemnation, saying that such attacks on Palestinian civilians were “unacceptable and must stop”. “Israeli authorities must take measures to protect all communities from harm, this includes intervening to stop such violence, and holding all perpetrators of such violence to account,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. Palestinian analyst and former Palestinian Authority spokeswoman Nour Odeh told the BBC that such attacks happened ""on a daily basis”. “These condemnations [by Israeli leaders] are viewed as performative by the Palestinian public, because the track record is [that] the investigations go nowhere, nobody is prosecuted, nobody is held to account, and these settlers can count on the full support of members of the government to protect them.” The UN said on Wednesday that it had recorded around 1,250 attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since 7 October. About 120 of those attacks led to people being killed or injured, and 1,000 led to property damage. It also said a total of 594 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - were killed in conflict-related incidents across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, over the same period. At least 577 were killed by Israeli forces and 10 by settlers, it added. Fifteen Israelis, including nine security forces personnel and five settlers, were also killed by Palestinians in the West Bank, while another 10 Israelis were killed in attacks in Israel by Palestinians from the West Bank, according to the UN."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg791g2z8zyo,Mason stripped of SNP whip over 'unacceptable' Gaza posts,"Writing on X Mr Mason said Israel's actions in Gaza did not amount to ""genocide"".",17 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.688298,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"SNP MSP John Mason has been stripped of the party whip after ""completely unacceptable"" social media posts about the conflict in Gaza. The move comes days after External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson was pictured standing alongside Israel’s Deputy Ambassador to the UK, Daniela Grudsky Many SNP figures are highly critical of Israel’s conduct in the Middle East and the diplomatic encounter prompted an internal backlash. Mr Mason said he was ""disappointed"" by his suspension, which came after he wrote on X that the country's actions in Gaza did not amount to ""genocide"". In response, a spokesperson for the SNP Chief Whip said: ""To flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable.  ""There can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance."" The spokesperson added the SNP Group would now meet to discuss the matter, with a recommendation of a fixed period suspension, for what they described as a ""utterly abhorrent comment"". The withdrawal of the whip means Mr Mason is effectively expelled from the SNP with immediate effect and must sit as an independent MSP until it is restored. Following the move the Glasgow Shettleston MSP posted a statement on Facebook which outlined his desire for peace in the region. The statement acknowledged ""too many"" lives had been lost and that ""many people feel that Israel has moved from a position of self-defence to seeking revenge"". Mr Mason added: ""However, I personally do not believe that Israel has tried to commit, has committed, or is committing genocide.   ""They certainly have the ability to kill many more Palestinians than they have done. That is not to say that the loss of life already is not too many.   ""And we should remember that it is Iran and Hamas who have stated that they want Israel wiped off the map… that sounds more like an intention of genocide than anything Israel has said or done."" On Wednesday Scotland's First Minister John Swinney defended Mr Robertson's face-to-face meeting with the deputy ambassador, which took place on 8 August. A spokesperson said Mr Robertson had “reiterated the Scottish government’s position in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides in Gaza”. They added that the external affairs secretary had called for “the unconditional release of all hostages and the opening of safe routes to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza.” But former minister Kevin Stewart branded the meeting a mistake. The Aberdeen Central MSP posted on social media, external: “I hope Angus Robertson also demanded an immediate ceasefire, castigated the IDF for bombing hospitals and schools and told you that Israel should comply with all of the UN Resolutions that have been passed over decades”. That was reposted by Ivan McKee, a serving Scottish government minister. John Swinney posted a statement online, acknowledging that some felt a meeting was “not appropriate”. But he stood by the decision to accept the Israeli request. The first minister explained that he saw it as an opportunity to convey the Scottish government’s “consistent position on the killing and suffering of innocent civilians in the region.” Mr Mason also met with Ms Grudsky and said they had a ""useful discussion about what Israel hopes to achieve in Gaza"". He added: ""As UK learned in Ireland, to achieve peace we must talk to each other...including to people we disagree with."" The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn49v0nzv3ko,"More than 40,000 killed in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry says","The actual number of people killed in the war is likely to be higher, local officials say.",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.782687,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza since the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel, the Hamas-run health ministry says. That number - 40,005 on Thursday - equates to about 1.7% of the 2.3 million population of the territory - another sobering indication of the human cost of the war. Alongside the fatalities, satellite image analysis suggests nearly 60% of buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war. In the past few months, the southern city of Rafah has suffered the most damage, imagery shows. The ministry’s figures for the number of people killed do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.  However, its breakdown of identified reported fatalities says a majority are children, women or elderly people. This month, Israel’s military told the BBC that more than 15,000 terrorists had been killed during the war. International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side. In the past, figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) were widely used in times of conflict and seen as reliable by the UN and international institutions.  It only counted deaths registered in hospitals with these entered in a centralised system along with names, identity numbers and other details. However, by late last year the MoH was unable to function effectively with overflowing mortuaries, fighting in and around hospitals and poor internet and phone connectivity.   The Hamas Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza began publishing numbers of deaths including reports given in “reliable media”.  UN agencies started to incorporate this into their data breakdowns as well as MoH figures when updates were available. More recently, Gaza’s MoH has begun to incorporate those reported as killed in the war including by family members online in its overall tally.   However, it also counts separately the number of unidentified bodies among the total number killed.  The UN now quotes these figures, with officials attributing them and stressing that their Gaza teams cannot independently verify them due to the conditions on the ground and the high volume of fatalities. Israel has consistently questioned the credibility of the information. In May, the Foreign Minister Israel Katz described it as “fake data from a terrorist organisation”. Several experts have said the actual number of people killed as a direct result of the war in Gaza is likely to be far higher, with local officials estimating that about 10,000 bodies remain under the rubble of buildings hit by Israeli air strikes. Ali Ashraf Ata Gheith, 15, told the BBC he spent two months digging his dead family from the wreckage of their bombed-out home. His mother, father, brother and two sisters were killed when it was hit by a strike. Ali was in the building too, but survived after being trapped under the rubble for seven hours. After he got out, he began trying to retrieve the bodies of his family. “I could see my father under the rubble but I couldn’t extract him at first because he was under two columns of cement, and the ceiling would have collapsed. He decomposed in front of my eyes,” he said. Even with a halt in fighting, researchers point out that in addition to the number of people killed as a direct result of the war, many more could die from indirect causes, such as disease and hunger. Ultimately when the war ends, efforts to recover bodies and trace the missing should allow a clearer idea to emerge of the number killed, including a figure for combatants. The UN and rights groups, as well as the Israeli military, can be expected to carry out their own investigations. Satellite image analysis suggests that around 59.3% of buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war. The damage analysis, carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, compares images to reveal sudden changes in the height or structure of buildings. The southern city of Rafah has sustained the highest rise in damaged buildings since March, according to the expert analysis. The majority of the destruction came after Israel launched an offensive on the city on 6 May. The military says that taking control of the area and eliminating the remaining Hamas battalions is crucial to achieving its war aims. In satellite imagery analysed by BBC Verify, large swathes of the city can be seen to be left in ruins - particularly around the border with Egypt and neighbourhoods to the north and south. Social media videos verified by the BBC and footage shared by Israel’s military shows that areas across Rafah have been damaged or destroyed by aerial bombardment as well as demolition by Israeli forces on the ground. In the image below we see a large section of cleared buildings immediately adjacent to the border. Satellite imagery shows land has been cleared along the so-called Philadelphi corridor – a buffer zone along the 14km (9-mile) border with Egypt. BBC Verify’s analysis of the imagery showed Israeli military vehicles in several areas where building clearance had taken place along the corridor. This includes a small neighbourhood located where the border meets the coast which was flattened within a month of the Rafah operation starting.  On the ground footage filmed by an Israeli soldier also showed that an observation tower was later built in the area. The operation has also destroyed key Rafah landmarks which includes the border crossing, several major mosques and the city's main market. On 7 May, videos verified by the BBC showed Israeli tanks crushing a ""Welcome to Gaza"" sign at the Rafah border crossing. Video posted on the same date also showed damage to the blue dome of the Abrar mosque. Satellite imagery captured subsequently showed the building was later destroyed. In another social media video shared on 27 June, roads and green lawns that once centred around Rafah’s famous Al-Najma roundabout were now churned up, with nearby buildings heavily damaged. The war began when thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrgp4gyv0lo,Ex-minister dies in Eritrean jail after six years without charge,Berhane Abrehe was Eritrea's longest serving finance minister before falling out with the president.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.873366,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Berhane Abrehe - a former Eritrean finance minister and fierce critic of the country's president - has died in prison, his family say. The 79-year-old was Eritrea's longest serving minister of finance, but he was removed from his role in 2012 following clashes with President Isaias Afwerki. Six years later, he was jailed after releasing a book where he described the president as a ""dictator"" who needed to resign. His family told the BBC that the authorities, who rarely confirm the deaths of senior officials in custody, had notified them of Mr Berhane's death. The government also rarely shares where the bodies are buried but Mr Berhane's family have heard there is a plan to bury him in Asmara Patriots Cemetery. Only veterans of the Eritrean independence war, like Mr Berhane, or members of the national service can be buried there. His body has not yet been released, his family said, and it is not clear when and exactly how Mr Berhane died. He was never brought before a court of law. President Isaias has ruled the East African country, without holding national elections, since winning the independence war against Ethiopia in 1991. Political parties, civic organisation and independent media are all banned. The UN and human rights groups have long accused the Eritrean government of gross human rights violations, including torture, forced disappearance and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in inhumane conditions. Mr Berhane's fall-out with President Isaias began during the former's 12-year tenure as finance minister, in which he urged Mr Isaias for transparency on the country's budget. The budget is still inaccessible to the public today. In 2012, Mr Berhane was removed from his post and sidelined from politics. Three years later he secretly wrote a two-volume book named My Country, and sent it abroad to be published. Alongside calling his old boss a dictator and demanding he resign, Mr Berhane used the book to challenge Mr Isaias to a debate on national television. He also called for the reinstatement of the national assembly -  Eritrea's parliament - which had been dissolved by the president in 2002. To this day, there is still no legislative body to hold the government accountable. In 2018, after Mr Berhane had published My Country, he was detained and imprisoned in an unknown location. By this time his wife was already in prison, although no reason was given. She was released in 2019. One of Mr Berhane's sons, who was also detained during the same period as his mother, previously described his family's ordeal to the BBC. “I am living with a dim glimmer of hope that my father who has health issues [will be out of prison one day],” Efrem Berhane said in 2020. The 31-year-old, who lives in the US after fleeing Eritrea, asked: “How can people be kidnapped by a government and disappear for years? Why do people show such cruelty on a fellow human like this?"" But some people have been imprisoned for even longer. In September 2001, 11 senior ministers and generals who were part of a group known as the “G-15” were arrested after they criticised the president. The collective - which included three former foreign ministers, an education minister and a former armed forces chief of staff - have not been seen since. In Eritrea, political prisoners are often prohibited from contact with the outside world. In February, Ilze Brands-Kehris, United Nations Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights said ""impunity persists"" for human rights violations in Eritrea. ""Our office continues to receive credible reports of torture; arbitrary detention; inhumane conditions of detention; enforced disappearances; restrictions of the rights to freedoms of expression, of association, and of peaceful assembly,"" she said. Born in Eritrea in 1945, Mr Berhane earned an MA degree in economics from a US university before joining the struggle for independence from Ethiopia. He is the father of four children.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86lgnnw4y3o,Panicked African workers prevented from leaving Lebanon,Thousands of Africans employed as domestic workers are fearing what could happen if war breaks out.,21 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:28.964796,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"“I want to go home,” Kenyan Eulita Jerop tells the BBC from Lebanon, where she is employed as a domestic worker. But the terms of her employment make it difficult for her to leave, despite fears of an all-out war in the country. She has been terrified by the unfamiliar sounds she has heard overhead on the outskirts of the capital, Beirut. The 35-year-old has been working there for the past 14 months. “It was so scary. We were told it wasn’t bombs, but it was [planes breaking] the sound barrier,” she says. “But the sounds were hitting so hard.” Her panic is shared by many others in her WhatsApp group of fellow domestic workers, she adds. The loud booms in the sky came from fighter planes. There are fears that they could foreshadow a full-on war. Israel and Lebanon-based group Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire across the border since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. It prompted the invasion of Gaza, which Israel says has the aim of eliminating Hamas. Hezbollah, a political movement and Iran-backed militia, says it is attacking Israel in support of the Palestinian people. The shells have mostly fallen in southern Lebanon and northern Israel, but there are concerns that the rest of Lebanon could get caught up as the conflict transforms into a wider regional struggle. The US, UK, Australia, France and Canada have all issued official advice for their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. But getting out is easier for some than others. Ms Jerop said it was common for employers to take their passports on arrival in Lebanon. Even with a passport, domestic workers still need an exit visa to leave - paperwork which must be approved by their boss. This is allowed to happen under the country’s “kafala” (sponsorship) system for foreign workers – which employs an estimated 250,000 people. “Kafala” gives individuals or companies permits to employ foreign workers. This means that their immigration status is entirely dependent on their employer and they have limited rights. Employers can take advantage of their position and many women are overworked, underpaid and physically abused – though this is not the case for Ms Jerop. Despite calls for significant reforms, the system continues in several Arab states. Daniela Rovina, communications officer at the International Organization for Migration, told the BBC that under international law a person must be allowed to leave a country if a conflict occurs. In Ms Jerop’s case, her employers want her to continue working in Lebanon. ""They are saying the situation has been here in Lebanon for many years, and there is nothing to worry about,” she says. “But for us the tension is high. We are not used to these kinds of [bombing] sounds.” But even with papers, Ms Jerop and her fellow domestic workers face other challenges to leave. “Few flights are available and they are very expensive,” she says. Flights to Kenya cost up to $1,000 (£770). Banchi Yimer, who founded an organisation supporting the rights of Ethiopian domestic workers, says the average monthly salary used to be $150 but since the cost-of-living crisis, which hit Lebanon hard, “many are not getting paid at all”. “Every day we receive calls from women panicking… they ask us if we have any [evacuation] plan, if we can do anything about it.” Chiku, another domestic worker from Kenya, whose name we have changed to protect her safety, cannot pay for the flight. She has been living in Baabda, in the west of Lebanon, for almost a year. “I personally would like to go back home. But the tickets are so costly,” she says. “And my mum and dad also can’t afford that money.” She has been living in fear for the past few weeks, but like Ms Jerop, her employer has told her to stay. “They say I can’t leave because I haven’t finished my contract,” Chiku says. “But is this contract more important than my life?” The Lebanese labour ministry has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment. The Kenyan authorities say that if war does break out, they will put an evacuation plan in place. Roseline Kathure Njogu, in charge of diaspora affairs for the Kenyan government, told the BBC the department can issue emergency travel documents for those without their passports. She assured that the Kenyan government would be able to provide emergency flights. “We have around 26,000 Kenyans in Lebanon, and 1,500 have registered with us for evacuation,” she said. But many want to leave right now. Ethiopian government spokesperson Nebiyu Tedla told the BBC they are “preparing contingency plans to evacuate diplomats and citizens from Lebanon if necessary”. However, Ms Banchi makes the point that even before the Israel-Gaza conflict, there were already many Ethiopian women stranded in Lebanon desperate to leave. A collapse in Lebanon’s economy in 2020 left many Ethiopian domestic workers out of a job. “Many cannot even afford rent or medical assistance, let alone a flight home,” she says. While foreign embassies continue to work on evacuation plans, many feel they have been abandoned by their governments to fend for themselves. Chiku is trying to set aside money to pay for a flight home. “But what about the others who can’t?” she asks. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Two audience members at his Fluffy Fluffy Beavers show, who were believed to be Israeli, objected to a joke comparing an abusive wife complaining about being abused herself to ""like being married to Israel"". They were heckled by other audience members as they left the venue, with Mr Hunter alleged to have then made a joke about the Jewish Chronicle newspaper being behind a paywall, saying it was ""typical Jews"". Police Scotland told the BBC that it was investigating the incident. Pressure group Campaign Against Antisemitism were among those who criticised the comedian. Mr Hunter, who has previously been nominated for the Perrier award and has appeared on many British TV shows, posted on social media about the incident at Assembly’s George Square Studios venue. He wrote: ""There was an unfortunate incident in my new show Fluffy Fluffy Beavers. As a comedian I do push boundaries  in creating humour, it's part of my job.  ""This inevitably creates divided opinions but I am staunchly anti-war and anti-bully. I regret any stress caused to the audience and venue staff members."" Mr Hunter then re-posted messages of support, including one saying ""stop saying 'antisemitism' to shut down criticism of the actions of Netanyahu/Israel.""  The incident had first been reported by the Daily Telegraph, whose critic Dominic Cavendish was reviewing the show. Mr Cavendish called it the ""most unpleasant comedy gig I’ve ever attended"" and said that audience members had ""erupted"" with abuse towards the Israeli couple, calling them ""genocidal maniac"" and telling them they were not welcome at the gig.  Campaign Against Antisemitisim said on social media that the comments were ""extremely concerning"" and that comedians should ""have a responsibility to their audience"". A Police Scotland spokesperson said the force was ""reviewing the circumstances"" of the incident.   In February, the comedian Paul Currie unveiled a Palestine flag during his show and became embroiled in a row with an audience member, telling the man to leave immediately. The man later said he felt threatened leaving as other audience members shouted abuse at him. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli offensive came after Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, capturing 251 others as hostages.  Mr Hunter repeated the joke at the centre of the row during his Edinburgh Fringe show on Thursday night, receiving laughter and applause from his audience."

Eastwood Theatre in Giffnock cancelled it a day after Mr Hunter apologised for what he called an ""unfortunate incident"" in Edinburgh. It was reported that two Israeli audience members objected to his joke that an abusive wife complaining about being abused herself was ""like being married to Israel"". They left the venue and were heckled by audience members. East Renfrewshire Culture and Leisure, which runs Eastwood Theatre, said it cancelled the September 28 show due to his ""controversial comments"". A spokesperson for the leisure body said it defended ""the freedom of expression of artists"" and it expected audiences to ""extend some latitude to many acts"". However, in this case of Reginald D Hunter, they said:  ""We have a commitment to our community, and to our values of diversity and inclusion, which we take seriously."" They said all customers would receive a refund. Campaign Against Antisemitism said on social media that Hunter's jokes were ""extremely concerning"" and that comedians should ""have a responsibility to their audience"". Police Scotland said its had been made aware of a ""hate incident"" but found that no crime had been committed. Mr Hunter, who has previously been nominated for the Perrier award and has appeared on many British TV shows, posted on social media, about the incident at Assembly’s George Square Studios venue. He said he regretted any ""stress caused"" but added ""as a comedian I do push boundaries in creating humour, it's part of my job."" Mr Hunter went on to repeat the joke on Thursday night, receiving laughter and applause from his audience. The BBC has contacted Mr Hunter's management for comment.   In February, the comedian Paul Currie unveiled a Palestine flag during his show and became embroiled in a row with an audience member, telling the man to leave immediately. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli offensive came after Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, capturing 251 others as hostages. BBC Journalist James Cheyne, who attended the Thursday night show, said the joke was ""just one of many"" things in the show which people might have taken offence at.  ""Reginald D Hunter used the N word, the C word, and made cracks about Rolf Harris and Jimmy Savile too.  ""It was in many ways common fare for a late night comedy gig at the Edinburgh Fringe, but the controversy his comments have caused was ever present in the room too. ""The comedian addressed it multiple times, opening with the words 'I wondered if anybody was coming' and adding 'It’s been quite a week.'  ""He said some people would come to his shows seeking to be offended and told them not to worry, promising “there is something for everybody.” ""The venue was mostly full, the crowd was supportive, laughing, clapping and cheering. ""One audience member shouted out “I’m Jewish and I love the joke” when he told it."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ndvg18j8o,Lebanese hold their breath as mediators scramble to avert all-out war,Locals in the capital Beirut tell the BBC their fears of another war between Israel and Hezbollah.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.216778,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Middle East is in turmoil. International diplomacy is in overdrive. And for once many in Israel, Lebanon and Iran have something in common - a war of nerves. They worry and they wait for what may come next. It feels like the whole region is holding its breath. Is this the slide towards an all-out regional war? Can a ceasefire be wrestled from the ruins of Gaza? How will Iran, and its proxy militia Hezbollah, retaliate against Israel for back-to-back assassinations in Beirut and Tehran? Will they heed calls for restraint? In Lebanon, the stultifying heat of summer is overlaid by a layer of anxiety. Heart-stopping sonic booms interrupt the hum of traffic in Beirut, as Israeli warplanes break the sound barrier in the skies above. Many foreign nationals are gone, heeding the advice of their governments. Plenty of Lebanese have fled too. Others cannot tear themselves away - like the 30-year-old chef of a hip café (Beirut has too many of these to count). She is tattooed and candid but prefers not to be named. “Living in Beirut is like being in a toxic relationship you can’t escape,” she tells me.  “I am emotionally attached. I have family abroad, and I could leave, but I don’t want to. We live day to day. And we joke about the situation.” In the next breath she admits business has suffered, and she has post-traumatic stress disorder. “It’s like a cold war for us,” she says. She is expecting a hotter one but hopes it will be short. International mediators are criss-crossing the region, working overtime to prevent a wider conflict. The US envoy Amos Hochstein is among them. “We continue to believe that a diplomatic resolution is achievable,” he said, “because we continue to believe that no-one truly wants a full-scale war between Lebanon and Israel.” He was speaking in Beirut on Wednesday, after meeting a close ally of Hezbollah, Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berry. When asked by a reporter if war could be avoided, Mr Hochstein replied: ""I hope so, I believe so."" But he added that the more time goes by, the greater the chances for accidents and mistakes. The last time Israel and Hezbollah went to war, in 2006, it lasted six weeks and caused major damage and loss of life in Lebanon. More than 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed, along with up to 200 Hezbollah fighters. Of the 160 Israelis killed, most were soldiers. All sides agree that a new war would be far more deadly and destructive. And many here in Lebanon agree that the country cannot afford it. The economy is crippled, and the political system is dysfunctional. The government can’t even keep the lights on. “I hope there won’t be a war,” says Hiba Maslkhi. “Lebanon won’t be able to cope.” We meet the tracksuit-clad 35-year-old on a slip way at the waterfront in Beirut. She’s focused on the Mediterranean, fishing rod in hand. “I hope wiser heads will prevail,” she says, “and that we can control the escalation so that things don’t get out of control.” She takes every sonic boom personally. “If I hear one, I start to panic, and I wonder if they [Israeli forces] have hit near my house or bombed the airport.” Hiba, who sells perfume for a living, says Lebanon has already suffered enough. “Ten months is a long time for us to be psychologically destroyed, hiding in our houses,” she says. “We are scared to start businesses to earn some money because we think war might be around the corner.” The current round of conflict here began last October when Hamas gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians. Hezbollah soon joined in, firing from Lebanon into Israel. The Shia Islamist armed group and political party - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Britain and the US - said it was acting in support of the Palestinian people. Since October, Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire, causing tens of thousands to flee on both sides of their shared border, and killing more than 500 in Lebanon, most of them fighters.  Israeli officials say 40 people have been killed there – 26 of them soldiers. Fears of a wider conflict were raised at the end of July, when an Israeli strike in Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander. Israel blamed him for the killing of 12 children in a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. It’s already all-out war in Gaza, where Israel has killed almost 40,000 Palestinians at last count, according to figures from the Hamas run  health ministry – data the World Health Organisation regards as credible. Gaza is the main concern for Ayman Sakr. He is fishing alongside Heba, but their views are far apart. The 50-year-old taxi driver insists that if all-out war comes, Lebanon will deal with it. “There is some concern, but we can handle it,“ he tells us. “In the end we will defend ourselves. If we die, that’s ok.” He is quick to pay tribute to the hundreds of Hezbollah fighters who have been killed by Israel, and to the leader of the armed group. “I salute the resistance and those who were martyred from the bottom of my heart,” he says, “and I salute Hassan Nasrallah who made us and all the Arabs proud. Everyone’s worried about Israel, what about the 39,000 people Israel has killed?” Ayman, who is a father of five, says the horror in Gaza is undeniable, but being ignored. “The whole world sees children, women and the elderly being massacred every day in front of the cameras and nobody notices,” he says. “People’s children are being killed in front of their eyes. Where is the world? Those who are quiet are complicit.” Hiba still hopes that full scale warfare can be avoided. “No-one has the right to kill anyone,” she says, ”not organisations, not parties and not militias. I hope the new generation is wiser than the one that came before it.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v5zgelqjyo,Cancelling show over Gaza remarks an 'error': Orchestra,Jayson Gillham premiered a piece that was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.315250,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) has admitted it made an ""error"" in cancelling an acclaimed pianist’s performance due to comments he made on the Israel-Gaza war. On Sunday, Jayson Gillham premiered a five-minute piece called Witness, written by composer Connor D’Netto, which was dedicated to the journalists of Gaza. Before starting the recital, Mr Gillham said Israel had killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. The MSO subsequently removed the British-Australian pianist from an upcoming concert on Thursday, saying he put them in a ""difficult situation"". Now the entire concert, due to be held at Melbourne Town Hall, has been cancelled due to safety concerns. The MSO says they are trying to reschedule the performance. At Sunday’s concert, which was held at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne, Jayson Gillham performed a range of other works, from Beethoven to Chopin.  Witness was a last-minute addition, according to the MSO. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" Mr Gillham claimed before starting to play Witness. In an apologetic statement on Thursday, the MSO said “While the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra maintains that a concert platform is not an appropriate stage for political comment, we acknowledge Jayson’s concerns for those in the Middle East and elsewhere."" “We recognise the strength of feelings of all parties on this matter and particularly acknowledge the dedication and commitment demonstrated by all our musicians and staff this week.” Mr Gillham has accepted the MSO’s apology. “I hold my relationship with the MSO, its players and audience with the highest regard and look forward to our continued working relationship in years to come,” he said in a statement. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. At least 113 of those were journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom. The decision by the MSO and their subsequent apology have caused a stir on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling,” later adding that “art is often powerful because it’s political”. Arts critic and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said of the MSO’s apology, “Not before time. How I wish Gillham was giving a concert in Sydney. He would get a standing ovation here from supporters who admire his courage almost as much as they admire his talent.” The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as sharp upticks in Islamophobia and anti-semitism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e8gzyp8e2o,"Hamas will not join Gaza ceasefire talks, senior official says",Mediators make urgent push for deal after the killing of Hamas's leader raises fears of regional war.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.460057,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A senior Hamas official told the BBC that it will not participate in the indirect talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal due to resume in Doha on Thursday. The Palestinian armed group wanted a roadmap for implementing the agreement and would “not engage in negotiations for the sake of negotiations in order to provide cover for Israel to continue its war”, the official said. He reiterated that the roadmap should be based on the proposed deal outlined by US President Joe Biden at the end of May and accused Israel of adding “new conditions”. Israel’s prime minister has denied doing so and said Hamas has been the one demanding changes. The talks are still expected to take place even without Hamas, as US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators say they could use them to put together a plan that resolves the remaining issues. They suffered several setbacks last month and have been suspended since Hamas's political leader and chief negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran.  The US hopes that finalising a deal could deter Iran from retaliating for the assassination against Israel - which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement  - and avert a regional conflict. The US has ramped up its diplomatic efforts ahead of the talks. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said in a phone call that ""no party in the region should take actions that would undermine efforts to reach a deal,"" a state department statement said. Mr Blinken also spoke separately to Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, the state department said. US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris were also briefed by their national security team on the latest developments in the Middle East, the White House said. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,960 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Last week, the leaders of the US, Egypt and Qatar issued a joint statement calling on Israel and Hamas to resume urgent discussions on a deal that would bring relief to the people of Gaza as well as the 111 remaining hostages, 39 of whom are presumed dead. A framework agreement was ""now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude"", they said, adding that they were prepared to present a bridging proposal that overcame their differences if necessary. Israel responded by saying it would send a team of negotiators to take part in Thursday’s talks. But Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - asked the mediators to present a plan based on where talks were a month and a half ago instead of engaging in any new rounds of negotiations. On Wednesday, a senior Hamas official confirmed that its representatives would not attend the meeting, despite many of them being based in the Qatari capital. “We want a roadmap to implement what we have already agreed based on President Biden’s ceasefire plan and the Security Council resolution, which guarantees Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, specifically from the Philadelphi corridor [running along the border with Egypt], and allows the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza without restrictions, and allows the flow of humanitarian aid,” he told the BBC. “It is Israel which added new conditions and reneged on its previous agreement,” he added. The first phase of the deal outlined by Mr Biden on 31 May and endorsed by the UN Security Council would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that unpublished documents showed Israel had relayed a list of five new conditions in a letter on 27 July, which added to the principles it had set out on 27 May and Mr Biden presented days later. It said the May proposal had talked of the “withdrawal of Israeli forces eastwards away from densely populated areas along the borders in all areas of the Gaza Strip”, but that the July letter had included a map indicating Israel would remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor. The report also said the letter had added a stipulation that an agreed upon mechanism should be established to ensure only unarmed civilians returning to northern Gaza were allowed through the Israeli-controlled Netzarim corridor, which effectively divides the territory in two. In response to the report, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement saying the charge that he had added new conditions was “false”, describing them instead as “essential clarifications”. “Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 27 July letter does not introduce extra conditions and certainly does not contradict or undermine the 27 May proposal. In fact, Hamas is the one that demanded 29 changes to the 27 May proposal, something the prime minister refused to do,” it added, without providing details about Hamas’s demands. Later on Tuesday, President Biden conceded that the negotiations were “getting hard”, but vowed that he was “not giving up”. He also said he believed an agreement would help avert the possibility of retaliation against Israel by Iran, Hamas’s main backer, for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. When asked by a reporter if Iran “could... stop doing action if a ceasefire deal is possible”, he replied: ""That's my expectation but we'll see."" Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the Hamas leader’s killing, has warned Iran that it would “exact a heavy price for any aggression”. Iran has dismissed Western calls for restraint and insisted that “a punitive response to an aggressor is a legal right”. Haniyeh has been succeeded by Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, who was one of the masterminds behind the 7 October attack. Mr Netanyahu said on Monday that Sinwar ""has been and remains the only obstacle to a hostage deal""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx924r4d5yno,"Where Kamala Harris stands on 10 key issues, from immigration to guns",Some of the vice-president's views have changed since she first entered politics.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.554963,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has been riding high on a wave of favourable polls and energetic rallies since she became the Democratic Party's nominee for president, and selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  She released a detailed policy guide in early September offering voters a sense of what a Harris-Walz administration might look like.  This focuses on her economic and foreign policy agenda, and highlights her most urgent priority to tackle the cost of living.  Here are her key policy pledges. As vice-president, she has been Mr Biden's partner in passing major economic legislation - regularly labelled ""Bidenomics"" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy. Growth and jobs creation have been strong but inflation and high interest rates continue to hit American wallets. In a convention acceptance speech focused on the economy, Ms Harris promised mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation. She said in her speech that her plans would create ""an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed"". In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN, Ms Harris said that ""one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class"", a theme that she has repeated on the campaign trail. Ms Harris's position on the border has changed over time to a more moderate one in this campaign. On the campaign trail, the vice-president has reiterated her continued support for the hardline bipartisan border security deal that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction.  It was torpedoed by congressional Republicans earlier this year at Trump's urging. It would have fast-tracked decisions on asylum cases, limited humanitarian parole, and expanded the authority to deport migrants. Part of her policy proposal is to revive the border security bill and sign it into law.  She has also said there ""should be consequences"" for people who cross the US border unlawfully, though she once held a much more lenient position. As vice-president, she was tasked with tackling the root causes of the record numbers of Central American migrants crossing the southern border. Those numbers spiked during the Biden administration, but have declined in recent months. She helped raise $3bn - largely from private companies - for regional investments in hopes it would encourage residents to remain in their home countries. Ms Harris has long supported women's right to an abortion. She has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. “When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,” she said at a rally for her 2024 campaign in Atlanta, Georgia. She has reiterated that commitment several times, including during the ABC News debate with Donald Trump. In her policy proposal, Ms Harris wrote she would ""never allow a national abortion ban to become law"".  Ms Harris was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and she toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to address state abortion bans - often framing the issue as one about personal freedom. Ms Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since she was elected to the US Senate. As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries. She attended the Munich Security Conference in the past year, and delivered remarks in support of western security alliance Nato that denounced isolationism and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ms Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”, and represented the US at Kyiv's “peace conference” in Switzerland. In her speech at the Democratic convention, she noted that she met President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""warn him about Russia's plan to invade"" five days before Russia invaded, and ""helped mobilise a global response"" after the war began.  The vice-president also pledged, if elected, to ensure that ""America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century"" and to shoulder the responsibility of US leadership. Ms Harris has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution, and she has called for an end to the war in Gaza. In her convention acceptance speech, she pledged as president to ensure ""that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination"". While serving as vice-president, she was one of the first members of the administration to call for an ""immediate cease-fire"", raise concerns over the ""humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians"" and charge Israel with ending the conflict.  She raised these issues in what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July. She has not supported an arms embargo on Israel, however, as some on the US left have called for.  And when she debated with Trump, she said: ""I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people."" At the party convention, she said she would ""always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself"". In her CNN interview, Ms Harris indicated that she would focus on securing a ceasefire deal, which was President Biden's approach. In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes, co-sponsoring a bill with Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments. As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%. This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also supported, of an increase to 28%. A campaign official told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal of not raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (£310,000).  During her acceptance speech after being confirmed as the Democratic candidate, she said she would ""pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans"". At the time of the speech, the details of the tax cut were unclear.  The Harris campaign later filled in the detail, saying that through the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit more Americans will be able to keep more of their income.  Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 tax cut.  Ms Harris held fairly progressive views about health care earlier in her career. She supported expanding publicly-funded health-care programmes in the US that cover the elderly, youth with disabilities and poor.  This included backing Medicare-for-All, a progressive priority that would make all health care publicly funded. She later walked that position back. Her campaign told the BBC that she would not push for a single-payer system if elected to the White House.  While vice-president, the White House has had health care successes. It reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage. On the campaign trail, she has said that she wants to erase billions of dollars in medical debt for Americans and would work with states on the issue. Details of the plan remain thin, but when she was California's attorney general, Ms Harris often used anti-trust laws to keep insurers, hospitals and drug companies to address costs. Ms Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, then California's attorney general.  Her offices increased conviction rates, particularly of violent criminals, though that history led to criticism from the progressive left, which at times labelled her ""a cop"" - though the right has accused her of being soft on crime. Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. She made mention of his conviction and him being found liable for committing sexual abuse in her Democratic party conference acceptance speech. As a prosecutor, Ms Harris defended California's climate laws and sued oil companies for environmental damage. She also called for climate change policies via a ""Green New Deal"" during her 2020 presidential campaign - some of which has come to fruition under the current administration.  During a CNN town hall in 2019, she said that ""there is no question I'm in favour of banning fracking"", which is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock that can be damaging to the environment. But she has gone back on that stance. During the presidential debate, she said she cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act - which opened up new leases for fracking companies - in addition to funnelling hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programs.  ""My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil,"" she said. Ms Harris said she will protect public lands and public health, lower household energy costs and hold polluters accountable to secure clear air and water if elected in November, according to her policy platform.  Ms Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career, and she successfully defended California's gun laws when they faced legal challenges as the state's attorney general.  As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and earlier this year announced resources to support the implementation of red-flag laws, which are aimed at keeping firearms from those who may harm themselves and others.  She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programs.  Her policy platform includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as a requirement for universal background checks.  During the debate she noted that both she and her vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz are gun owners."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c985y78d0g1o,Father says baby twins killed by Israeli strike in Gaza as he registered births,The twins were just four days old when their home was reportedly hit in an Israeli strike.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.641310,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Newborn twins were reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza while their father was at a local government office to register their birth. Asser, a boy, and Ayssel, a girl, were just four days old when their father Mohammed Abu al-Qumsan went to collect their birth certificates. While he was away, his neighbours called to say their home in Deir al Balah had been bombed. The strike also killed his wife and the twins' grandmother. “I don’t know what happened,” he said. “I am told it was a shell that hit the house.” ""I didn't even have the time to celebrate them,"" he added. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says 115 infants have been born and then killed during the war. According to AP news agency, the family had followed an order to evacuate Gaza City in the opening weeks of the Israel-Gaza war, seeking shelter in a central part of the strip, as the Israeli army instructed. The BBC has asked the Israeli army for comment on the strike, and is waiting for a response. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas operating in dense residential areas, including using civilian buildings as shelter. But officials rarely comment on individual strikes. Several such shelters in Gaza have been attacked in the past few weeks. On Saturday, an Israeli air strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, the director of a hospital told the BBC. An Israeli military spokesman said the school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denied. Israel disputed the number of dead, but the BBC could not independently verify figures from either side. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.  Update 16 August: This article’s headline originally explained that newborn twins were killed in Gaza as their father went to register their birth. It was amended to a longer headline emphasising the fact that their father said they had been killed in an Israeli strike."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8431ejnk5o,Columbia University president resigns after Gaza protests turmoil,Minouche Shafik's resignation comes a year after she took the position at the Ivy League university.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.730237,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned from her position, four months after the institution was rocked by campus protests over the war in Gaza. Dr Shafik's resignation comes only a year after she took the position at the private Ivy League university in New York City, and just a few weeks before the autumn semester is due to begin. Dr Shafik is now the third president of an Ivy League university to resign over her handling of Gaza war protests. In April, Dr Shafik authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building. The episode marked the first time that mass arrests had been made on Columbia's campus since Vietnam War protests more than five decades ago.  The move inflamed other protests at dozens of colleges across the United States and Canada. In an email to students and faculty on Wednesday, Dr Shafik wrote that she has overseen a ""period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community"". ""This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community."" Katrina Armstrong, chief executive officer of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, will serve as the interim president. “Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead,” Dr Shafik wrote in her letter. “I have tried to navigate a path that upholds academic principles and treats everyone with fairness and compassion,” she continued. “It has been distressing - for the community, for me as president and on a personal level - to find myself, colleagues, and students the subject of threats and abuse.” In a statement, the university's board of trustees co-chairs said: ""Minouche has contributed so much to the Columbia community in an extraordinarily challenging time."" ""While we are disappointed to see her leave us, we understand and respect her decision."" Students' anger over how Israel is fighting its war against Hamas has raised fraught questions for university leaders, who are already struggling with combustive campus debates around what is happening in the Middle East. US college campuses have been a flashpoint for Gaza war protests since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, and Israel's subsequent incursion into the Gaza Strip. The leaders of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology all testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.  The presidents of Harvard and UPenn ultimately resigned amid backlash over their handling of campus protests and congressional testimony, including their refusal to say that calling for the deaths of Jews could violate university policy. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a fierce critic of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on US campuses, welcomed the news on X, formerly Twitter.  ""I stood in President Shafik’s office in April and told her to resign, and while it is long overdue, we welcome today’s news,"" he said.  ""Jewish students at Columbia beginning this school year should breathe a sigh of relief."" In April, Dr Shafik defended her institution's efforts to tackle antisemitism to Congress, saying that there had been a rise in such hatred on campus and the college was working to protect students. Dr Shafik is a highly-respected Egyptian-born economist who formerly worked for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. She also previously served as president of the London School of Economics. Dr Shafik, who received a damehood in 2015, was previously considered to be on the shortlist for the Bank of England governor, the BBC reported in 2019. Her letter adds that she has been asked by the UK Foreign Secretary to lead a “review of the government’s approach to international development and how to improve capability”. The decision, she wrote, “enables me to return to the House of Lords and to reengage with the important legislative agenda put forth by the new UK government”. Her resignation comes after three Columbia University deans also resigned last week, after text messages showed the group used ""antisemitic tropes"", according to a statement by Dr Shafik, while discussing Jewish students. The text exchanges were originally published by the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce in early July.  Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, the chairwoman of the congressional committee, praised the decision by the three administrators to resign. “About time. Actions have consequences,” she said in a statement last Thursday, adding that the decision should have been made “months ago”. “Instead, the University continues to send mixed signals,"" she continued, adding that the administration is allowing a dean who has not resigned to ""slide under the radar with no real consequences”. Universities around the US are preparing for the academic year to begin in the next several weeks, as the conflict in Gaza continues. On Tuesday, a judge in California ruled that UCLA - which saw violent protests break out on campus in May - must prevent protesters from blocking Jewish students from campus facilities. Judge Mark Scarsi ruled that protesters had “established checkpoints and required passers-by to wear a specific wristband to cross them”, and blocking “people who supported the existence of the state of Israel”. “Jewish students were excluded from portions of the UCLA campus because they refused to denounce their faith,” Judge Scarsi wrote in the order. “This fact is so unimaginable and so abhorrent to our constitutional guarantee of religious freedom that it bears repeating.” The university has blamed outside agitators for the checkpoints and said it objected to the ruling. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war. At least 39,897 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjwygwx2xjo,US says it aims to 'lower temperature' in Middle East,The US is stepping up its efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.835754,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The US is aiming ""to turn the temperature down"" in the Middle East, the country's ambassador to the UN has said, as fears of an Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel loom. On Tuesday, Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council in New York the US wanted to ""deter and defend against any future attack and avoid regional conflict"". There are fears Iran could retaliate against Israel following July's assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran - something Israel has not said it was behind. US President Joe Biden suggested reaching a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could help deter Iran from launching an attack on Israel. ""That's my expectation but we'll see,"" he said when asked by a reporter on Tuesday. ""We'll see what Iran does and we'll see what happens if there's any attack, but I'm not giving up,"" he said, while exiting his plane during a visit to New Orleans, Louisiana. A new round of ceasefire talks is scheduled to take place in either Doha or Cairo on Thursday. But a Hamas official in Lebanon, Ahmad Abdul Hadi, has said Hamas will not take part in the talks, according to reports by the New York Times and Sky News. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed plans to travel to the Middle East on Tuesday to participate in negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire deal. International mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been pushing for an agreement that would see Israeli hostages released to their families in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Meanwhile, Washington has also approved new arms sales worth $20bn (£15.5bn) to Israel.  The state department said Israel would buy 50 F-15 fighter jets, as well as 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 mortar cartridges and new military cargo vehicles. The aircraft will begin to be delivered in 2029. At the Security Council meeting in New York, Ms Thomas-Greenfield called for a ceasefire deal to be finalised. ""A broader regional conflict is not inevitable,"" she said. ""The United States’ overall goal remains to turn the temperature down in the region, deter and defend against any future attacks, and avoid regional conflict,"" she added. ""That starts with finalising a deal for an immediate ceasefire with hostage release in Gaza. We need to get this over the finish line."" But Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, accused the Security Council of not doing enough to stop Israel's military operation in Gaza. ""Wake up. Stop finding excuses. Stop imagining that you can reason with the Israeli government so it stops killing civilians by the thousands, imposing famine, torturing prisoners, colonising and annexing our land, all while you appeal to them, call on them, demand them to stop,"" Mr Mansour said. Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan said the Israeli military took every possible measure to minimise collateral damage and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields. He also criticised the Security Council for not condemning the actions of Iran. ""As we speak here now, millions of Israelis are preparing for a direct Iranian attack, just as they did in April. Iran's aggression threatens the entire region with war."" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 39,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hundreds of people have also been killed in the almost daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the conflict. Amid a flurry of international diplomacy to de-escalate tensions, Iran on Monday dismissed calls from the UK and other Western countries to refrain from retaliation against Israel for the killing of Haniyeh. Israel, which did not say it was involved in Haniyeh’s assassination, has meanwhile put its military on its highest alert level. The US has warned that it is preparing for “a significant set of attacks” by Iran or its proxies as soon as this week, and has built up its military presence in the Middle East to help defend Israel."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24p94pv6myo,Gaza protesters descend on Chicago for Democratic convention,The four-day convention is set to celebrate Kamala Harris - but party divisions over Gaza could lead to disruption.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:36.933043,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Democratic National Convention begins on Monday in Chicago, in what is expected to be a celebration of Kamala Harris's nomination as presidential candidate following Joe Biden's exit. However protests over the war in Gaza, led by Democrats from the party's left, threaten to disrupt the unity message. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected near the convention site to show their opposition to President Biden's policies towards Israel and Gaza, from which Ms Harris, his vice-president, has not deviated. There will also be events organised by pro-Israel groups, including a ""hostage square"" to draw attention to the plight of those who remain in Hamas captivity. Relatives of hostages are also expected to attend the convention. The four-day Democrat spectacle will culminate on Thursday with Ms Harris giving a primetime speech that will be watched by millions of Americans, fewer than three months before election day. President Biden, the former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and a list of actors and entertainers will give speeches at the United Center in Chicago. It comes a little over a month after Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination in Milwaukee, just days after surviving an assassination attempt and as Democrats were in disarray over 81-year-old Mr Biden's weakness as a candidate. Since then the momentum of the race has shifted significantly, with Ms Harris's entry to the race and her running-mate choice of Tim Walz, Minnesota's governor,  jolting enthusiasm and pushing them slightly ahead of Trump and his running mate JD Vance in national polls. What remains unclear is how the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party will tackle policy towards Israel and the conflict in Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza intending to destroy Hamas after the group attacked southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 people have since been killed in the campaign in the strip. Ms Harris has not released a clear policy on Gaza and Israel. She has, however, called for a ceasefire and for the respectful treatment of protesters at her rallies.  She also recently said ""far too many"" civilians had been killed but did not back a weapons embargo on Israel as some progressives have called for.  The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Opposition to the Biden administration's handling of the conflict caused more than 750,000 people to vote ""uncommitted"" - rather than for any specific candidate - during the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year.  While the energy of that campaign has ebbed slightly, the presence of that vote in key swing states such as Michigan would still be felt at the convention. Only three dozen delegates will represent the ""uncommitted"" vote and they will be greatly outnumbers by the more than 4,500 backing Ms Harris. However, they speak for hundreds of thousands of unsatisfied voters. In interviews, they said that they intended to spend the convention pressing the Harris campaign and their party to act more forcefully on Gaza. ""We know that this is not a small endeavour. We are challenging a status quo US policy of the past 40 years, and it won't shift overnight,"" said Samuel Doten, a Democratic organiser and ""uncommitted"" delegate. Several of the delegates said they hoped to convince fellow Democrats to sign a letter demanding Ms Harris and the party support a ceasefire and arms embargo against Israel.  They said they were not trying to spoil the convention or the election, but were rather pushing the party to adopt a policy popular among Democratic voters. ""There are thousands of voters across the US who voted 'uncommitted', so it feels like a huge responsibility for us to present their wishes and to make sure that their voices are being heard and amplified in this party,"" said Adrita Rahman, who will attend the DNC for the first time as an ""uncommitted"" delegate. It remains to be seen how many people will protest in Chicago against the Gaza war. Organisers had suggested  there could be 100,000, but have since said ""many, many thousands"" on Monday and ""tens of thousands"" in total by the end of the week. Monday's protests will take place before President Biden delivers the night’s main speech.  Ms Harris had earned some goodwill from Gaza protesters as she was one of the first members of the Biden administration to call for a ceasefire, and express a sharper opinion of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's prime minister. But many protesters said the the vice-president’s honeymoon period is over and  they expected to see a policy position that was actionable. ""The people inside the DNC need to know that they have some very unpopular policies. We're here to tell them,"" said protester Irene Alikakos at a protest on Sunday of a few hundred people near Chicago's Trump Tower.  The DNC will also coincide with a consequential week for the US-mediated ceasefire talks, which the White House has described as being in their ""final"" stages.  This diplomatic reality could put Ms Harris in a tenuous position. As a current member of the US administration, it is difficult for her to stray from Mr Biden's position on Gaza under normal circumstances. It is even more difficult with negotiations potentially coming to a close.   Some close to her have said that, either way, there would be no significant policy shift.  Halie Soifer, who was Ms Harris's national security adviser in the Senate, said there was ""no daylight between"" Ms Harris's views and Mr Biden's.  ""Her policy, which is the policy of this White House, is not changing,"" said Ms Soifer, who now leads the Jewish Democratic Council of America. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02jd0n9d2o,Pianist's Melbourne show cancelled over Gaza remarks,Jayson Gillham dedicated a piece of music to journalists killed in Gaza.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:37.017862,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) has cancelled an acclaimed pianist's upcoming recital after comments he made on the Israel-Gaza war. Jayson Gillham premiered Witness at a show at the MSO on Sunday. The piece was penned by another composer as a tribute to the Palestinian press. The British-Australian was scheduled to perform again on Thursday, but the MSO has said it is reworking the programme after Gillham introduced the piece by saying  Israel had killed more than 100 journalists. A spokesperson for Gillham told the ABC he won't comment on the decision to drop him ""out of respect to the MSO and his ongoing relationship with them"". Gillham - who is billed on the MSO website as ""as one of the finest pianists of his generation"" - was born in Australia but lives in the UK. At the concert at the Iwaki Auditorium on Sunday, he performed a range of works, from Beethoven to Chopin. He also played Witness, written by Australian composer Connor D'Netto, which the MSO says was a last-minute addition. ""Over the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists,"" Mr Gillham said before starting the piece. A number were ""targeted assassinations of prominent journalists"" who were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing press jackets, he claimed. ""The killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world,"" he added. In an email to patrons, the MSO said they were blindsided by Mr Gillham's comments and he had put them in a ""difficult situation"". “The MSO does not condone the use of our stage as a platform for expressing personal views”, it added. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organisation that promotes press freedom, reports that 113 of those were journalists. Apologising for the ""offence and distress"" caused, the MSO said it had removed Gillham from the program and would update customers soon. In a statement given to local media, a spokesperson for the MSO said: ""Mr Gillham's remarks went beyond the remit of his contract."" The decision has caused a backlash on social media. High profile barrister Greg Barns said the cancellation was “truly appalling” while arts critics and former Sydney Symphony Orchestra chairman Leo Schofield said “MSO management should hang its collective head in shame”. The Israel-Gaza war has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. As has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c303d4pdpg6o,Hamas says guards killed hostage and wounded two others in Gaza,The Israeli military says it does not have any information to refute or confirm Hamas’s statement.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:45.785288,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hamas’s military wing says that two of its guards have shot and killed one Israeli male hostage held in Gaza and seriously wounded two female hostages. The Israeli military said in response that it did “not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas’s claims”. Abu Ubaida, the spokesman for the al-Qassam Brigades, said on Telegram that the shootings had happened in two separate incidents and that “attempts are being made to save” the lives of those wounded. He did not identify the hostages or give more details about when or where the attacks occurred, saying an investigation was under way. He blamed the incident on what he said were Israeli “massacres” of Palestinians. The Israeli military said: “We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message and will update with any more information that we obtain.” This is the first time that Hamas has said that its guards have killed hostages during the continuing war in Gaza. Previously, it has said that hostages have been killed by Israeli air strikes. In the past, Israel has dismissed Hamas statements on the deaths of hostages as psychological warfare. According to Israeli tallies, 251 people were kidnapped during the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October in which some 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed. It is thought that 111 of the hostages abducted by Hamas remain in Gaza, including the bodies of 39 who the Israeli military says are dead. Another two Israeli civilians who independently entered the Palestinian territory are also being held, as well as the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who were killed in the Gaza war in 2014. At least 39,929 people have been killed in Gaza during the current conflict, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas’s statement comes as talks aimed at ending the war and bringing home remaining hostages are due to resume in Cairo or Doha on Thursday. Israel has said that it will send a delegation to meet mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar. Hamas has said that it does not plan to send negotiators, and has instead called on mediators to present a plan to implement what it agreed following earlier rounds of talks."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58yj57jdeo,Israeli minister denounced over call for Jewish prayer at Jerusalem holy site,Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound with Israelis who defied a ban on Jewish prayer.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:45.901482,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A far-right Israeli minister has led hundreds of Jewish Israelis into Jerusalem’s most contested holy site, with many defying the Israeli government’s long-standing ban on Jewish prayer there. The visit by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, has been condemned as provocative by Palestinian leaders, as well as the US, France, the UN and several Arab states. Mr Ben-Gvir said in a video that “our policy is to enable Jewish prayer”. But the Israeli prime minister’s office insisted there had been no change to the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there. The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Situated in occupied East Jerusalem, it was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access. Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police. Videos shared on social media on Tuesday showed groups of Jewish Israelis singing the Israeli national anthem, some carrying the Israeli flag while others prostrate themselves in prayer at the edge of the holy site. Visiting the compound escorted by Israeli police, Itamar Ben Gvir, said “great progress” had been made in Israel’s “governance and sovereignty” there. “Our policy is to enable Jewish prayer,” he went on. He also declared that Israel “must win the war” in the Gaza Strip, and should not get involved in the talks on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to “bring Hamas to its knees”. Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the incident had “deviated from the status quo.” “Israel's policy on the Temple Mount has not changed; this is how it has been and this is how it will be,” it stressed. In response to the statement, Mr Ben-Gvir said that it was his own policy to “enable freedom of worship for Jews in all places”. “There is no law that permits engaging in racist discrimination against Jews at the Temple Mount or anywhere else in Israel,” he added. However, the Palestinian foreign ministry expressed great concern about what it called “the dangerous escalation resulting from the raids by extremist settlers on the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque”. “The ministry will continue its political efforts to address these provocations at various levels, warning of their serious consequences on the conflict arena and the region as a whole,” a statement said. The Jordanian Islamic endowment which administers the site, the Waqf, said more than 2,000 Israelis had entered the compound and appealed to Muslims across the world to help it maintain the status quo. Jordan’s foreign ministry said the incident reflected “the insistence of the Israeli government and its extremist members to flout international laws and Israel’s obligations as the occupying power”. Egypt and Saudi Arabia also said the incident violated international law, with the former adding that Mr Ben-Gvir was seeking to scupper attempts to broker a Gaza ceasefire deal. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Mr Ben-Gvir's visit ""demonstrated blatant disregard for the historic status quo with respect to the holy sites in Jerusalem.  ""These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,"" the US's top diplomat added. The French foreign ministry condemned Mr Ben-Gvir's visit, saying: ""This new provocation is unacceptable"". UN spokesperson Farhan Haq called the incident “unhelpful and unduly provocative”, adding: ""We are against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14znyrdkrmo,Iran rejects Western calls to refrain from attack on Israel,"Iran's president says retaliation for the killing of Hamas's leader is its ""legal right"".",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:45.984393,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Iran has dismissed calls from the UK and other Western countries to refrain from retaliation against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last month. Amid a flurry of international diplomacy to de-escalate tensions, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to ""stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack” in a rare telephone conversation on Monday. But Mr Pezeshkian said retaliation was a “way to stop crime” and Iran’s “legal right”, according to Iranian state media. Israel, which did not say it was involved in Haniyeh’s assassination, has meanwhile put its military on its highest alert level. The US has warned that it is preparing for “a significant set of attacks” by Iran or its proxies as soon as this week, and has built up its military presence in the Middle East to help defend Israel. The powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon is also threatening to retaliate over Israel’s killing of one of its top commanders in an air strike in Beirut. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed plans to travel to the Middle East on Tuesday to participate in talks on ending the war in Gaza. On Monday evening, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany issued a joint statement urging Iran and its allies to “refrain from attacks that would further escalate regional tensions”. ""They will bear responsibility for actions that jeopardise this opportunity for peace and stability,” Sir Keir, President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Later, the British prime minister also expressed his deep concerns directly to Iran’s president by telephone - the first such call since March 2021. Sir Keir told Mr Pezeshkian that “there was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration”, Downing Street said. “He called on Iran to refrain from attacking Israel, adding that war was not in anyone’s interests,” it added. On Tuesday morning, Iranian state news agency Irna reported that Mr Pezeshkian had told Sir Keir that Western countries’ support for Israel had encouraged it to “continue atrocities” and threatened peace and security. “Pezeshkian stated that from the point of view of the Islamic Republic of Iran, war in any part of the world is not in the interest of any country, emphasizing that a punitive response to an aggressor is a legal right of states and a way to stop crime and aggression,” Irna added. The Iranian foreign ministry separately rejected the call for restraint from London, Paris and Berlin. “Such demands are void of political logic, in complete contradiction to the principles and rules of international law, and excessive,” spokesman Nasser Kaanani said. The Israeli military said on Monday that it was taking Iran’s statements seriously. “We are prepared at peak readiness in offence and defence, and we will act according to the directives of the government,” spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a briefing. An Israeli government spokesman meanwhile warned Iran and its allies that Israel would “exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from any arena”. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters: “We share the same concerns and expectations that our Israeli counterparts have with respect to potential timing here. [It] could be this week.” “It is difficult to ascertain at this particular time if there is an attack by Iran and or its proxies, what that could look like, but we have to be prepared,” he added. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has dispatched a second aircraft carrier strike group as well as a guided missile submarine to the Middle East to reinforce what the Pentagon said was the “United States’ commitment to taking every possible step to defend Israel”. The US believes that a new deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages would be the best way to calm tensions in the region, and has called for talks to resume on Thursday. Israel has said it will send a team of negotiators to finalise a deal, while Hamas has indicated an agreement in principle to participate despite the killing of its leader. Hamas said on Sunday that any deal must be based on where talks were a month and a half ago, rather than any new rounds of negotiations. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 39,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. Hundreds of people have also been killed in the almost daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the conflict."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy49xlx54vo,Four takeaways from Kamala Harris's convention speech,The vice-president hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but her vision for the future lacked detail.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:46.082016,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, delivering a speech which hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but had only rare moments of soaring rhetoric and broke little new ground. The ground-breaking was in the nature of the nominee herself - the first woman of colour to become a major party's presidential nominee. “Never let anyone tell you who you are,” Ms Harris said. “You show them who you are.” But for roughly 45 minutes on Thursday, she tried to tell Americans who she is - and what she would do if she wins the White House.  Here are four takeaways from her convention-closing remarks.  Many Americans know who Ms Harris is, but not many know what she believes in or details of her background. First and foremost, her convention speech set out to change that. She recounted her mother’s journey as an immigrant from India. She spoke about how her parents met – and how they ultimately divorced. She talked about her childhood upbringing in a working-class neighbourhood in Oakland, California. “The middle class is where I come from,” she said. “My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us.” Ms Harris also spoke of why she chose to become a lawyer – and a prosecutor. She drew a line from her early days in the courtroom to her public services as a politician. “My entire career, I have only had one client,” she said. “The people.” Ms Harris’s speech included calls for unity and a pathway beyond the “bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles” of modern American politics. She said that the US had a “precious, fleeting” opportunity to “chart a new path forward”. But that chart had few details. Vague calls for unity and a path beyond partisanship are rhetoric many presidential hopefuls have used in the past.  When Ms Harris did turn to policy details, she spoke in generalities.  She said she will be focused on lowering the costs of “everyday needs” – including healthcare, housing and groceries. She specifically called out abortion rights – and framed it as a means of preserving freedom, which has been a recurring theme at this Democratic convention. “America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially about matters of heart and home,” she said. Ms Harris, in her speech, styled herself as a centre-left moderate, putting little daylight between her policies and those of her boss, the man she hopes to replace, Joe Biden. “Everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation ready to move forward,” she said. “Ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America.” The exact details of that step, however, are to be determined. As pro-Palestinian protesters marched outside the convention, Ms Harris devoted particular attention in the foreign-policy section of her speech to the Gaza war. Here, yet again, there was little difference between her rhetoric and views and those of Mr Biden – and she linked herself to the president several times. “President Biden and I are working around the clock,” she said, “because now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire done.” She also pledged to ensure that Israel always has the ability to defend itself and took particular note of the brutality of the 7 October Hamas attack. For a moment, it sounded like some in the crowd would jeer, but Ms Harris quickly moved on to the plight of Palestinians, saying that the scale of their suffering was “heartbreaking”. That will hardly be enough to satisfy the protesters outside, however, and they could return to their homes – some in key battleground states like Michigan – convinced that a Harris presidency would be a continuation of the Biden Gaza War policies. Two days ago, Michelle and Barack Obama formed a tag-team that belittled former president Donald Trump for what they charaterised as his small obsessions and petty personality. Ms Harris also took swipes at her Republican opponent, but they were pretty standard fare for Democrats – including Mr Biden - over the past few months. “In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man,” she said. “But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.” She brought up the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, and mentioned his criminal convictions. She also hit what has become a favourite Democratic punching bag, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a Republican presidency. Although the former president has disavowed the plan, she noted that it was written by his advisers and it sought to “pull our country back into the past”. The future vs the past contrast has been a central theme of the Harris campaign so far, as it was in her nomination acceptance speech.  It’s one of the ways the vice-president has been able to draw a distinction not only from her current Republican opponent, but from the unpopular aspects of her boss, Joe Biden, who just a few weeks ago was the presumptive Democratic nominee.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86l4pl6072o,Yemen weapons dealers selling machine-guns on X,The traders operate in the capital Sana’a and other areas under control of the Houthis.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:46.175961,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Weapons dealers in Yemen are openly using the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to sell Kalashnikovs, pistols, grenades and grenade-launchers. The traders operate in the capital Sana’a and other areas under control of the Houthis, a rebel group backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorists by the US and Australian governments. ""It is inconceivable that they [the weapons dealers] are not operating on the Houthis’ behalf,"" said the former British Ambassador to Yemen, Edmund Fitton-Brown, who now works for the Counter Extremism Project.  ""Purely private dealers who tried to profit from supplying, [for example] the government of Yemen, would be quickly shut down."" An investigation by The Times newspaper found that several of the Yemeni accounts bore the blue tick of verification.  Both The Times and the BBC have approached X for comment, but have not so far received any response.  Most of the platform’s content moderators were laid off after the new owner Elon Musk bought the company in 2022. The advertisements are mostly in Arabic and aimed primarily at Yemeni customers in a country where the number of guns is often said to outnumber the population by three to one.  The BBC has found several examples online, offering weapons at prices in both Yemeni and Saudi riyals. The words beside the weapons are designed to lure in the buyers.  ""Premium craftsmanship and top-notch warranty,"" says one advertisement. ""The Yemeni-modified AK is your best choice."" A demonstration video, filmed at night, shows the seller blasting off a 30-round magazine on full automatic.  Another offers sand-coloured Pakistani-produced Glock pistols for around $900 each.  Yet these advertisements are not hidden in the depths of the Dark Web, where guns and other illegal items are usually traded, they are in plain sight on X, openly accessible to millions of people. Commenting on this, UK-based NGO Tech Against Terrorism issued what it called an urgent plea to tech platforms to actively remove Houthi-supporting content on the internet and social media platforms. The Houthis, a mountain-based tribal minority, swept to power in Yemen in 2014, ousting the UN-recognised government.  Since then, a seven-year military campaign led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia failed to remove them, while the country descended into civil war.  In late 2023 the Houthis, who have an extensive arsenal of drones and missiles, many supplied by Iran, have been targeting commercial and naval shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis say this is in support of Palestinians in Gaza, but many of the vessels have had no links to Israel.  A US-led maritime force offshore has failed to stop the Houthis’ attacks on shipping, which have had a disastrous effect on trade passing through Egypt’s Suez Canal."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c5yk93jkj4xo,How a Facebook advert changed a life and the look of a sport,"Phoebe Schecter had watched two Super Bowls and found them both ""boring"" before a move to the UK sparked an unlikely NFL career",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:46.256960,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"How a Facebook advert changed a life and the look of a sport Phoebe Schecter was still getting used to life in a new country. At the age of 22, she had moved on her own from the United States to the United Kingdom. She had been living and working in rural Cheshire for about two months and was starting to feel a little homesick, a little lonely. She then chanced upon an advert on social media and made a bold decision. ""It changed the complete trajectory of my life,"" she says. ""It's been the best decision Iâve ever made."" That decision has taken the 34-year-old into the world of the NFL. It may yet take her to the Olympics. Schecter has become one of the key figures in the NFL's international broadcast operation Growing up in Connecticut, Schecter's main passion was horse riding and, after studying equine business management, she began working with horses. Schecter, whose mother is British, made use of her dual citizenship in 2012, accepting a job at an equestrian centre near Congleton and opening out her horizons. ""I needed something new in my life,"" she says. ""I needed a change of scenery, a new challenge."" It was a challenge. Schecter was working six days a week, but during her limited downtime she began scrolling online and saw something about a women's American football team.  In February 2013, she attended a trial in Manchester and a new passion was born. ""I had moved by myself so was definitely missing home,"" she says. ""I really wanted to meet new people and get a bit of American culture. ""I saw the ad and just went for it. When you're out of your comfort zone, you're so much more willing to take risks, and that's kind of what happened with me. ""Because of my accent they thought I could throw the ball, but there was no correlation at all. I had no idea what I was doing. ""But I was enthusiastic, I was passionate. I'd never played a contact sport before but there seemed to be some sort of calling towards it."" Schecter didn't just find a new community, she found a new way of life, which has taken her all over the world. She has become a role model and a trailblazer, going inside an NFL locker room as a coach and to the Super Bowl sidelines as a broadcaster. And she could even go to the Olympics as a player, as this week she represents Great Britain at the Flag Football World Championships. Schecter (left) on the sidelines of one of the NFL's international games in Frankfurt last season, with fellow analyst Jason Bell More than a decade after seeing that social media ad, Schecter is one of the UK's biggest American football personalities. But don't let her accent fool you. Her love of American football blossomed in the UK. ""When I was in the States, I watched maybe two Super Bowls,"" she says. ""I hate to say it now, but I thought the sport was so boring. I didn't understand it at all. ""So now, to think I was able to work my way up and go to the NFL, it's kind of one of those pinch-me things, that you don't believe is real."" Soon after the trial in Manchester, Schecter became one of the founding members of the GB women's tackle football team. She also started playing flag football - the non-contact version of the game, which will make its Olympic debut at Los Angeles 2028 - and with the Staffordshire Surge, a men's tackle team. She took an interest in coaching and in 2016 did the first of three internships at American universities. Then in 2017, she did the first of two internships with the Buffalo Bills, becoming Britain's first female coach in the NFL. Having not grown up with the game, Schecter says she ""came into this whole experience knowing I was behind the eight ball - I had to fast-track my learning"". She created her own glossary to help herself with the game's terminology. She printed pictures of the Bills' coaching staff so she'd know who was who. She joined as many meetings as possible and continually asked questions. ""It was a baptism of fire,"" she says. ""It was definitely a huge learning curve. But being curious has been really helpful for me. I was doing whatever I could to build my experience and absorb as much information as possible. ""I wanted to learn and was so passionate. I had consistent, positive energy - every single day, no matter what the result was at the weekend. It may seem like nothing, but itâs actually really important. ""Once you understand the value you bring to a team, it gives you that boost of confidence of 'I know why Iâm here, I know what I can do'."" The NFL is a male-dominated environment but Schecter tried to ignore the fact she was one of the few women clocking in at the Bills' training facility each day. ""If you go into that experience thinking 'oh my gosh, I'm the only woman here', you already have the wrong mindset, your focus is going to be on the wrong thing,"" she says. ""I was there to be the best educator and coach I can be, regardless of my background. ""Some of the guys were saying 'hey, what can't I say around you?' But I said 'in order to get the best version of you, I need you to be your authentic self, to speak freely'. If it's not something you'd say in front of your mother or grandmother, perhaps it's something you shouldnât be saying in a professional environment anyway. ""But being a woman was also a super power in some ways. Having those inter-personal skills, a lot of my athletes felt more comfortable speaking to me because they grew up in single-mother homes, so to have a female around wasnât a bad thing.  ""They just werenât used to it in a coaching capacity."" Schecter remembers the moment she truly felt that she belonged.  The Bills' offensive unit had a meeting each morning and everyone would sit in the same seat. When a new player came in mid-season and sat in Schecterâs seat he was told 'youâve got to get up, this is her seat'. ""That meant so much,"" she says. ""It was only a little thing but the feeling of belonging was huge. I was really a part of that team. They really saw me as one of them."" Schecter has enjoyed a similar feeling in her broadcasting career, which also began by chance. Schecter became Britain's first female coach in the NFL when she interned on the Buffalo Bills' backroom staff Schecter had already done some radio work when she began appearing on Sky Sports' American football coverage during the Covid lockdown. When the broadcaster's main NFL host Neil Reynolds was ill over Christmas 2022, Schecter and Hannah Wilkes were asked to present the live Sunday show. It was the first time that women had been on.  Schecter is now a regular analyst, appearing alongside Reynolds and former NFL player Jason Bell. ""Broadcasting was never anything I was looking to do,"" she says. ""I was so nervous to sit on a couch with an ex-player and Neil, who's an NFL legend in the UK, and give my opinion. ""At first in particular, lots of people had lots to say [on social media]: 'What does she know? Why is she here?' I would never want someone to think: 'Oh, sheâs been put there because sheâs a woman.' ""So when Neil or Jason back up what I say, all those that perhaps don't believe in me see that and are like: 'Yeah, youâre right.' That's been massive for my development, to help build my confidence and show the audience 'this girl knows what sheâs talking about'."" Besides criticism on social media, Schecter faced hostility at a coaching event where an older male coach said she didn't deserve her position with the Bills. ""He said he'd been working for something like that for so long,"" she says. ""In the past, something like that would probably have gotten to me but already, by his attitude towards me, he showed that he wouldn't be the right fit for a professional NFL team.  ""They just want the best person possible and whoever will help them win. ""The NFL is trying to get more females involved in the sport in general, but you still have to earn your place - you still have to prove that you belong, to be given these opportunities."" Because of Schecterâs attitude and work ethic, she continues to earn them.  ""You can never learn enough,"" she says. Schecter, who will write a BBC Sport column during this year's NFL season, has developed her media career alongside playing and coaching Schecter delivers coaching clinics across Europe; she is a committee member for both the British American Football Association (Bafa) and International Federation of American Football (Ifaf); she is a global flag football ambassador for the NFL. ""My schedule is nuts,"" she says. ""It's a lot, but I love it. I love the energy. You've got to take advantage of every minute in the day. ""Before I moved to the UK, if anyone said I'd ever be doing any of what I'm doing now, or be half the person I am now, I wouldn't have believed them. It's been absolutely insane. ""The sport has completely changed my life, and all I want to do now is give back, as much as possible."" Having played her last tackle game for Great Britain earlier this month, she is now preparing to represent them at the Flag World Championships in Finland. Flag is the most inclusive and accessible form of American football. According to Ifaf, it is played by about 20 million people in more than 100 countries and the rapid growth of the women's game was key to it being chosen as one of five sports to be added to Olympic programme for 2028. Great Britain's women's team, who won the 2023 European Championship, are ranked fourth in the world. They make their World Championships debut on Tuesday (12:00 BST), taking on Czech Republic in their opening group game before meetings with Israel and Panama. The top three teams in the pool will progress to the last 16. The US are the worldâs top-ranked team - followed by Mexico and Japan - having won the past two World Championships, but they were beaten 39-6 by Mexico in the final of the 2022 World Games. A top-seven finish will ensure Great Britain a place at the 2025 World Games in China, and a strong performance in Finland would strengthen their claim for better funding. Kate Bruinvels, Ellie Thorpe and Kellie Barrett, three of Schecter's Great Britain flag football team-mates Great Britain coach Dean Whittingslow says it costs ""thousands each year for players to train, participate and travel"", and the GB programme launched a crowdfunding page to help cover team costs for the World Championships. Schecter is one of the longest-serving members of the 12-player squad in Finland.  While she discovered the sport at that trial in Manchester, many of her team-mates first tried it at school or university. A few of the others previously played soccer, netball or even ultimate frisbee. Schecter has also added 'scout' to her many roles. A conversation with one of the NFL's flag football suppliers revealed that his daughter is not only a flag quarterback, but also a British passport holder. Brittany Botterill came aboard and was named the tournament Most Valuable Player as Great Britain became European champions last year. The newest member of the team is Emily Kemp, who previously played flag at college in the US. That makes it three US-born players on the GB squad, but coach Whittingslow is ""not specifically looking for talent in America, that's happened naturally"". He is also not focused on recruiting athletes from certain sports. ""There is plenty of interest in flag football, and there are transferable skills from a multitude of other sports,"" he says. ""At this point, all options are open. It's about bringing in the best talent to get the best output on the field. ""We've got a really strong team right now. Between now and then [2028], some of the players are likely to age out, but we've set up a youth pathway and if we get the right level of funding, investment and support over the next four years, I've no doubt we will have every chance of winning a medal."" Schecter, who plays as a centre, remains a key member of the GB team. Whittingslow says she ""puts her body on the line, always gives her all and demands the same from those around her"". She could be one of those to 'age out' and lose her spot before LA 2028. She is philosophical about her chances. ""I could potentially play at 38, but then I think, 'if I'm still playing then, have we done the right things, in terms of development?',"" she says. ""There should be better, faster, stronger people coming to take my spot. Thatâs how we all get better, ultimately. But if Iâm not there as an athlete, I would absolutely want to be there as a coach. Coaching is the root of who I am.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj08mjmq107o,News Corp boss apologises for doing Nazi salute,"Patrick Delaney tried to explain the context of an old photo that showed him ""demonstrating"" the gesture.",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:46.343546,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The boss of Foxtel - a majority News Corp-owned cable television company in Australia - has ""unreservedly"" apologised after an image surfaced of him performing a Nazi salute.  Patrick Delaney said he believed he was showing ""the similarity"" between the gesture and one used by some fans of a Western Sydney soccer club when the photo was taken a decade ago. ""Regardless of the context, the fact I demonstrated this offensive salute was wrong,"" he said in an email to staff seen by the BBC. The Jewish Council of Australia condemned Mr Delaney's actions as ""deeply concerning"". “Equally [concerning] is that he operates in a media industry where he felt this was somehow okay,"" Sarah Schwartz, the council's executive officer, said in a statement on Monday. ""It shouldn't need to be said that the salute is an offensive and violent act not only for Jews, but also for other racialised groups."" In his internal memo, Mr Delaney said that he had been ""searching [his] mind"" for a circumstance where ""a photo capturing me in this pose could ever be possible"". He then explained that he believed he was impersonating a threatening gesture made by a group of Western Sydney Wanderers fans during the 2014-15 season, while visiting the set of a Fox Sports television program during his tenure as the channel’s CEO. Mr Delaney said the photograph - first published by Crikey - was ""completely inconsistent"" with his ""values, beliefs, and family connections"". He also condemned ""racism in all its forms"", pointing to his commitment to the 'Say No to Antisemitism letter' which he signed along with other prominent Australian leaders in the wake of the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken hostage. Mr Delaney added that he would continue to meet with Jewish leaders to ""express"" his ""deep remorse"". But Ms Schwartz said the idea that Mr Delaney could sign a letter condemning antisemitism, while also feeling comfortable doing a Nazi salute, was proof the nation needed ""more than superficial pledges"". The scandal comes at a time when Australia is grappling with a sharp uptick in both antisemitism and Islamophobia, amid rising community tension over the Israel-Gaza war. In July, the federal government installed a special envoy to combat antisemitism, while promising to appoint an Islamophobia equivalent in the coming months. During a visit to Sydney in November, Lachlan Murdoch called on News Corp's staff in Australia to ""address and tackle"" all forms of antisemitism and said there was ""no room for equivocation"" or fence-sitting on the issue.  Once a mainstay across the nation's homes, Foxtel's business model has been in sharp decline in recent years, after being displaced by the rise of cheaper international streaming services. Earlier this month, News Corp said it was considering selling the ailing pay TV company."

The drugs were wrapped in plastic painted in two shades of green to resemble the fruit and placed among real watermelons. More than two tonnes  of methamphetamine - in a total of 1,220 packages - was seized by officers. Stashing drugs among produce is a common way to smuggle the illicit substances across borders - banana shipments are the most popular but officers have recently found narcotics in Gouda cheese and avocados. US Customs and Border Protection officials said their officers had stopped a truck hauling a trailer at the border with Mexico in Otay Mesa. The paperwork suggested the driver was transporting a shipment for watermelons, but a inspection revealed the parcels containing methamphetamine.  Also known simply as meth, it is a powerful and highly addictive stimulant.  The driver was handed over to Homeland Security officials.  The seizure came a week after officials at the same border crossing discovered almost 300kg of meth in a shipment of celery. Both hauls came to a total value of $6m, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Mexican drug cartels are the leading producers and suppliers of methamphetamine to the United States. In February, Mexican security forces seized more than 40 tonnes of the drug at the biggest lab to be discovered in recent years. Mexican officials said the lab boasted more than 200 centrifuges, boilers and condensing chambers - key equipment used to make the chemical.  "

In a statement on Sunday night, the group called on mediators “to present a plan to implement what was agreed upon by the movement on July 2, 2024, based on [President Joe] Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution”. On 2 July, Hamas issued its response to the outline ceasefire plan announced by Mr Biden on 30 May. The details of Hamas’s response have not been made public but the group is understood to have dropped a demand for a full ceasefire at the outset rather than an initial six-week pause put forward by the president. Negotiations resumed a week later, with Hamas accusing Israel of introducing new conditions. Hamas sources told the BBC that the introduction of the new conditions - that displaced Palestinians should be screened as they return to the north of Gaza, as well as the question of control of the Philadelphi corridor that borders Egypt - have been sticking points.  It has also been widely reported in the Israeli press that these new demands were made by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that they have caused friction with his negotiating team. Last week, international mediators from Qatar, Egypt and the US urged Israel and Hamas to resume urgent discussions on the ceasefire and hostage release deal on 15 August. The mediators said they were prepared to offer a bridging proposal to overcome differences on the implementation of Mr Biden's framework agreement. Israel responded on Thursday, saying it would send a team of negotiators to take part in the meeting. Hamas rejected any new proposals, but the BBC understands that the group is open to resuming talks at the point prior to which the new conditions were introduced. On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany issued a joint call for talks to resume, saying there ""can be no further delay"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz echoed the mediators' call for ceasefire talks to resume in a joint statement. ""We agree that there can be no further delay,"" the statement said. ""We have been working with all parties to prevent escalation and will spare no effort to reduce tensions and find a path to stability."" The countries also called for the de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East - which have risen since the assassination of senior members of Hamas and Lebanese group Hezbollah. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on Sunday night that he had ordered the deployment of a guided missile submarine to the Middle East which will join the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is heading to the region. Iran previously said it will respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh at the “right time” in the ""appropriate"" manner and that the US bears responsibility for his death because of its support of Israel. Iran has blamed Israel for the assassination, though Israel has not commented directly. Meanwhile on Sunday, the Israeli military ordered thousands of Palestinians in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, to relocate to what it has designated ""humanitarian zones"". The relocation order followed an Israeli air strike against a school building in Gaza on Saturday, which killed more than 70 people according to a local hospital director. Fadl Naeem, head of al-Ahli Hospital where many of the casualties were taken, said around 70 victims were identified in the hours after the strike - with the remains of many others so badly disfigured that identification was difficult. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denies. IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said “various intelligence indications” suggest a “high probability” that the commander of Islamic Jihad’s Central Camps Brigade, Ashraf Juda, was at al-Taba’een school school when it was struck. He said it is not yet clear whether the commander was killed in the attack. The BBC cannot independently verify casualty figures from either side. Israel claims that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure to plan and carry out attacks, and that is why it has been targeting hospitals and schools - sites protected under international law. Hamas has consistently denied the accusations. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war. At least 39,897 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry."

More than 70 people were killed at the building which sheltered displaced Palestinians, the director of a hospital has told the BBC. Ms Harris said ""far too many"" civilians had been killed ""yet again""and reiterated calls for a hostage deal and a ceasefire, echoing comments made by the White House. An Israeli military spokesman said al-Taba’een school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denies.  Speaking at a campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona, Ms Harris said Israel had a right to ""go after Hamas"" but also has ""an important responsibility"" to avoid civilian casualties. Saturday's air strike has been criticised by Western and regional powers, with Egypt saying it showed Israel had no desire to reach a ceasefire or end the Gaza war. Fadl Naeem, head of al-Ahli Hospital where many of the casualties were taken, said around 70 victims were indentified in the hours after the strike - with the remains of many others so badly disfigured that identification was difficult. Israel's military said it had ""precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the al-Taba'een school"". A statement by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency said ""at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists"" were ""eliminated"" in the attack. IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said “various intelligence indications” suggest a “high probability” that the commander of Islamic Jihad’s Central Camps Brigade, Ashraf Juda, was at the Taba’een school when it was struck. He said it is not yet clear whether the commander was killed in the attack. The BBC cannot independently verify casualty figures from either side.  The Israeli spokesman said the casualty figures released by Hamas officials ""do not align with the information held by the IDF, the precise munitions used, and the accuracy of the strike"". Hamas described the attack as a ""horrific crime and a dangerous escalation"" in Israel's ""war of extermination against the Palestinian people"". US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Hamas had been using schools ""as locations to gather and operate out of"". ""But we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimise civilian harm,"" he added. Israel has attacked several such shelters in Gaza in the past few weeks. According to the United Nations, 477 out of 564 school buildings in Gaza have been directly hit or damaged as of 6 July, with more than a dozen targeted since. Al-Taba’een school housed more 1,000 people - having recently received dozens of displaced people from the town of Beit Hanoun, after the Israeli army ordered them to leave their homes. The building also served as a mosque and the Israeli strike hit during dawn prayers, witnesses said.  Jaafar Taha, a student who lives near the school, told the BBC the sound of the bombing was followed by screaming and noise.  ""'Save us, save us,' they were screaming,"" he said. ""The scene was horrific. There were body parts everywhere and blood covering the walls."" Salim Oweis, spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC the attack was ""really outrageous"". ""All those schools are really packed with civilians, children, mothers and families, who are taking refuge in any empty space whether it's a school or it's a mosque, whatever it is, even in hospital yards."" This strike has again drawn graphic attention to a controversial dynamic of the Gaza war.  Israel claims that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure to plan and carry out attacks, and that is why it has been targeting hospitals and schools - sites protected under international law.  Hamas has consistently denied the accusations. Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive against Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

According to Abdel Nasser's colleagues, the van’s driver got out and greeted him in Arabic.  It was early in the morning. The 24-year-old uniformed policeman had just come on shift. CCTV pictures show him strolling out past a guard post, his rifle slung casually at his side. Seconds later, a man in jeans and a dark T-shirt emerges from the direction of the white van, uniformed Israeli soldiers behind him. He raises a handgun and shoots Abdel Nasser dead. Soon, the street is full of Israeli soldiers. They retrieve Abdel Nasser's rifle and, as his colleagues try to retrieve his body, continue to shoot – all captured on CCTV.  When we visited Tubas the following morning, in late July, we found a makeshift memorial of stones and wilting flowers on the ground where Abdel Nasser fell. The guard post and adjacent walls were riddled with bullet holes, each marked with a yellow tag. Fading bloodstains smeared the ground and doorway. In a statement released on the day of the incident, the Israeli army said the shooting occurred in the course of an operation to detain two wanted men. Abdel Nasser’s colleagues in Tubas said those arrests took place at a nearby house. The army said that soldiers had “encountered armed terrorists” and that “a customs officer of the Palestinian Authority was killed during exchanges of fire”. From the evidence of the CCTV footage, this last statement is demonstrably false. An Israeli security official contacted by the BBC two weeks later said the incident was “one of hundreds, if not thousands of special activities that are planned and carried out very precisely"". This one was being reviewed, he said, “because it didn’t go as planned"". It seems clear that this was an operation that went badly wrong. No-one has suggested that Abdel Nasser or the customs office were the target of the operation. The young guard appears to have had the misfortune to stumble across an undercover Israeli operation, during which he was shot and killed.  But for Abdel Nasser’s colleagues in the customs police, this tragic episode is part of a wider pattern of behaviour that is making it harder than ever for the Palestinian Authority – theoretically responsible for security in areas not under direct Israeli military control – to do its job. “This rings a warning bell, especially for us in the security services,” Lt Ibrahim Ayyash, spokesman for the Palestine Customs Police, told us. “How can we enforce law and order and offer services to the people and protect them while you’re obstructing my work and killing my officers?” Customs officers, he said, were increasingly reluctant to pull over suspicious vehicles, for fear of stumbling across Israeli soldiers operating under cover. “It now falls on you, as a custom officer, to take a decision about stopping a vehicle or not,” he said. “If you stop it and it has Special Forces [inside], they could kill you.” As fans of the Israeli TV show Fauda will know, undercover operations were already a regular feature of life in the West Bank long before the war in Gaza broke out last October. Recent evidence suggests the frequency of such operations have increased, with multiple cases of CCTV pictures showing Israeli units, dressed as civilians, and even medics, snatching wanted Palestinians from city streets and hospital beds. But such clandestine operations are part of a much bigger picture. With all eyes focused on Gaza, another war is raging in the West Bank, as the Israeli military cracks down on armed groups that it says are being bankrolled by Iran. “The situation on the ground is very, very complicated,” an Israeli security official told me, on condition of anonymity. “You might say that it's on the verge of an explosion.” The emergence of a new generation of local armed groups, mostly in the refugee camps of the northern West Bank, dates back to about 2021, with the first group appearing in Jenin. But the war in Gaza has fanned the flames of rebellion in other cities, from Tulkarem to Qalqilya and, more recently, Tubas. Israel’s security crackdown, the actions of violent groups of Jewish settlers and the belief that the Palestinian Authority is powerless to protect them have all added to an atmosphere of mounting tension. “They're very frustrated with Israel, they're very frustrated with the Palestinian Authority and they're looking for an outlet to this frustration,” the Israeli security official said. The PA health ministry says more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since last October. As many as 10,000 have been arrested, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society. At least 18 Israelis, including 12 security forces personnel, have also been killed in the West Bank. On Saturday, one Israeli was killed and another injured when Palestinian gunmen opened fire near the Israeli settlement of Mehola.  Later in the day, Hamas said it had carried out the attack in retaliation for the Israeli air strike which killed dozens of Palestinians sheltering in a school in Gaza City. Some veteran observers fear that armed clashes could erupt into a full-scale uprising, or intifada. “If it goes into an intifada, this is a much, much bigger problem,” Gen Israel Ziv, former head of the IDF’s Operations Division, told me. “Militarily, we handle things better or worse. But when it goes into an intifada, it's a totally different story. And it might go there.” With the Israeli military still focused on the war in Gaza and its simmering conflict with Hezbollah along its northern border, Gen Ziv said there’s reluctance to recognise danger much closer to home. “It's a huge problem that can blow up in our face in a more sensitive area, [close] to the centres of population in Israel,” he said. Meanwhile, in the Balata refugee camp, on the edge of Nablus, Abdel Nasser’s family is still grieving. They’ve watched the CCTV pictures from Tubas and drawn their own conclusions about the actions of the Israeli army. “He come to kill, just to kill,” Abdel Nasser’s uncle, Ismail Mohammed Sarhan, says. Abdel Nasser’s father, Mohannad, can barely comprehend the loss of his son. What was he like, I asked him. “Ambitious, kind, always smiling,” he said, unable to hold back the tears."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qewlw1e3zo,UK's Starmer urges Iran to refrain from Israel attack,The UK PM tells Iran's president there is a serious risk of miscalculation if an attack goes ahead.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.161957,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has urged Iran to ""refrain"" from attacking Israel during a phone call with Iran's new president.  Sir Keir told Masoud Pezeshkian there was a ""serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration"", Downing Street said.  It is the first call between a UK prime minister and an Iranian president since March 2021 when former British leader Boris Johnson spoke to Hassan Rouhani. News of the 30-minute discussion came as the UK issued a joint statement with the US, France, Italy and Germany - urging Iran to end its threats of an attack on Israel.  They called on Iran to ""stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place"".  The leaders, who spoke together by phone, also expressed their support for the ""defence of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups"". Fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East have been growing following the recent assassination of senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. On Sunday, the US confirmed it had sent a guided missile submarine to the region in response to these concerns. The submarine can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, which are used to strike land targets. It had also ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which is carrying F-35C fighter jets, to accelerate its journey there. The ship was already on its way to replace another US ship in the region. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later said that the US shared Israel's concerns that it was ""increasingly likely that there will be an attack by Iran and or its proxies and perhaps in the coming days"". ""That is why we have been continually speaking to our Israeli counterparts and other counterparts in the region,"" Mr Kirby added.  Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said that the country took the threats of its enemies seriously and that Israel was at ""peak preparedness for attack and defence"".  Downing Street also said on Monday that Keir Starmer had told Mr Pezeshkian he was ""deeply concerned by the situation in the region and called on all parties to de-escalate and avoid further regional confrontation"".  Iran blames Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on their soil late last month and has vowed to punish it.  Israel, which is currently engaged in a war attempting to destroy Hamas in Gaza following the group's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October, has not commented but is widely believed to have been behind the killing. Iran's acting foreign minister said last week that the country would respond to the killing of Haniyeh at the “right time” in the ""appropriate"" manner. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of states with Muslim-majority populations, said it held Israel fully responsible for the attack, which it called ""a serious infringement"" of Iran's sovereignty. Ismail Haniyeh is not the only senior member of Hamas to be killed recently. Israel also recently announced that the group's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. The Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, with which Israel is also engaged in a conflict, has also said that it would retaliate for the death of its senior commander Fuad Shukr. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the latest leader to urge his country's citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible, warning of the risk of growing tensions.  Airlines including Lufthansa, Swiss Air and EasyJet have either cancelled or suspended flights to the Middle East. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ey324neeo,Harris speech to provide finale to Democratic convention on day four,The vice-president's' speech will share the story of her upbringing and contrast her vision for America to the one offered by Trump.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.252697,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Democrats will gather in Chicago on Thursday night where Vice-President Kamala Harris will make the biggest speech of her life, as she readies herself for the sprint before November's presidential election. On the final day of the Democratic National Convention, Ms Harris will formally accept her party's nomination - following a ceremonial roll call earlier in the week during which state delegates confirmed their support. Her running mate Tim Walz spoke on Wednesday night, making a personal pitch to middle America by giving a ""pep talk"" in the vein of an American football coach. US political conventions, which happen every four years before a presidential election, date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered to nominate him for a second term. Here’s what to know about the 2024 DNC, which has been attended by thousands of people. The convention has all been building up to Thursday night. When she takes the stage, Vice-President Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination, and give a speech looking ahead to November. It will be the most significant address of her political career. Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden stepped aside and gave her his backing, following weeks of pressure from party members. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who both represent swing states, are also expected to speak on Thursday - as is high-profile Republican Adam Kinzinger. Wednesday night was Mr Walz's first significant opportunity to introduce himself to the nation - and specifically to connect with middle America.  His speech was heavy on his personal story, including the importance of his family, his teaching career and time spent coaching a high-school football team, his stint in Army National Guard, and his service as a congressman and Minnesota governor. Long-time TV host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance, receiving a raucous response and urging Americans to ""choose truth"" in the upcoming vote. Other prominent Democrats who featured on the same night included grandees Bill Clinton, the former president, and Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.  There were also appearances by rising stars such as Josh Shapiro, the governor of the swing state of Pennsylvania. Earlier in the week, the convention heard from President Joe Biden, who stepped aside last month for Ms Harris to contest the presidency. On Monday, he gave an emotional defence of his time in the White House: ""America, I gave my best to you."" The same evening, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, took the stage and voiced her hope that Ms Harris could finally break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US by becoming the first female president.  During back-to-back speeches on Tuesday, Barack and Michelle Obama mixed gags with serious exhortations to Democrats to get out and vote in November. ""Hope is making a comeback,"" said Mrs Obama. This was a contrast with the ""chaos"" of Donald Trump's time in the White House, Mr Obama added. And Trump's former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham gave a speech of her own criticising her ex-boss. America's Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff was introduced to the stage on the same night by his son Cole, who called him a ""goofy dad"".  Mr Emhoff went on to laud his wife, Ms Harris, as the ""right person"" for him and the presidency alike. Because Ms Harris and Mr Walz were already nominated ahead of the event, and the roll call was a formality, this year's convention has been focused on speeches and the adoption of the party’s policy platform. Delegates have been working in the daytimes to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence.  In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it. Members of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there is plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself has been offering live-streams on social media platforms.

About 50,000 people are thought to have travelled to the event in Chicago. They include thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties, as well as party grandees and some members of the Democratic National Committee. As with the equivalent Republican event last month, which featured famous faces as well, the DNC has been a star-studded affair. Winfrey and Lil Jon have been joined by musicians Stevie Wonder, John Legend and Lil Jon, and comedian Mindy Kaling. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will make appearances themselves, but neither has confirmed anything. Demonstrations have been taking place outside the convention centre, focusing on opposition to US support of Israel’s war in Gaza. A further demonstration is planned on Thursday.  On Wednesday, a group of delegates who were denied the chance to speak at the convention began a sit-in outside the arena. The delegates, selected in state Democratic primaries earlier this year, have pledged themselves ""uncommitted"" to any presidential candidate as part of an internal protest over Gaza. Earlier in the week, a protest on Tuesday near Chicago's Israeli consulate culminated in scuffles between demonstrators and police and led to several arrests. And thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest on Monday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. Several were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence. In that night's address, Mr Biden acknowledged that the activists ""have a point"", going on to say that ""a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jl0p4vklyo,Why this Democratic convention will not be like Chicago in 1968,There are parallels - a president exiting the race and anti-war protests - but the violence and chaos of that event is unlikely to be repeated when Democrats convene in the city this week.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.352252,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"When 21-year-old Indiana University philosophy student Craig Sautter drove to Chicago for the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he had an ""inkling"" that he would be in for a ""wild day"". There had been a series of riots after the back-to-back assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy just months before, and he could tell that simmering tensions were ready to boil over when thousands of protesters, police, politicians and delegates gathered that August to pick who would be the next Democratic candidate for president. Yet the young anti-Vietnam War activist was still shocked by what he saw: National Guardsmen with bayonets, protesters ripped from cars or beaten with police batons, and thick clouds of tear gas wafting through crowds of thousands. ""We were mostly middle-class kids, or business people who were there in suits, protesting against the war,"" Mr Sautter recalled. ""We never thought that the police would attack an unarmed group of people who were just singing and shouting... we were in disbelief."" Ultimately, more than 600 protesters were arrested and over 100 treated for injuries, alongside 119 police officers. Scenes of the violent clashes in the streets and parks of Chicago soon flashed on TV screens across the country, and the world, leaving an unforgettable image of America in chaos. ""People were chanting that the whole world was watching,"" added Mr Sautter, now a professor at Chicago's DePaul University who researches presidential conventions. The return of the DNC to Chicago in 2024 has led many to look back at 1968 and draw parallels. Like back then, there will be anti-war protests - this time against the Biden administration's support for Israel during the war in Gaza.  And like back then, there has been a surprising change of guard amongst Democratic leadership. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election months before the convention, while this time, President Biden pulled out of the race with merely weeks to go. But experts and veterans of the 1960s protest movement believe the differences far outweigh the similarities. Nonetheless, some of those involved in planning the anti-Gaza war protests at the upcoming DNC say they draw inspiration from the activists who took to the streets of Chicago nearly 60 years ago.  ""This is the Vietnam War of our era,"" Hatem Abudayyah, a spokesman for the Coalition to March on the DNC, told the BBC. ""The attacks on our movement, our students and our organisations are similar to the attacks on the movement that was trying to stop 1968... I absolutely see those parallels."" The coalition includes over 200 organisations involved in the protests, and its spokespeople have said that ""tens of thousands"" of participants are expected.  The size of the protests has prompted Chicago's police department to warn that it won't tolerate ""violent actors"" or incidents of vandalism or criminality.  Mr Abudayyah says there has been ""no evidence of any violence"" during protests organised by the coalition or its member groups since the conflict in the Middle East began 10 months ago. Others have dismissed any real similarities to 1968. ""Other than the fact that they're in Chicago, there are none,"" long-time Democratic National Committee member and DNC delegate Elaine Kamarck told the BBC. ""This is not even close."" One key difference, according to Ms Kamarck, is that the Chicago police employed ""very, very thuggish tactics"" 56 years ago. A federally-mandated commission later accused the force of a ""police riot"" at the DNC.  Just months before, then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had also issued ""shoot to kill"" orders in the wake of riots after Martin Luther King's death.  ""All hell was breaking loose,"" said Ms Kamarck, who was 18 at the time. ""There's no such thing going on now.""  Ms Kamarck's assessment was echoed by Marsha Barrett, a professor of US political history at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.  ""Daley had very strong control over police, and an antagonistic relationship with protesters,"" she said. ""The city had set up a situation where there was likely to be a major conflict.""  ""We don't have that now,"" she added.  Chicago police have been in regular touch with DNC protest groups and have vowed to protect their rights to free speech, provided that the protests remain lawful.  ""The understanding of police activity at that time was that the would use whatever force was needed to overcome resistance,"" said Mr Sautter.  ""Now the police are better trained,"" he added. ""They're not going to provoke anything unless some kind of violence breaks out.""  Among those who witnessed the violence first-hand was Abe Peck, then editor of the Chicago Seed, an underground newspaper linked to the Youth International Movement, or Yippies, that planned events around the 1968 convention. ""We were in our office, which was in a dry cleaners', and all of a sudden our window fragmented,"" remembers Mr Peck, who was later credited with creating the ""whole world is watching"" chant. ""Two shots were fired through it. Fortunately nobody was hit."" When they ran outside to investigate, Mr Peck saw only one vehicle: a Chicago police cruiser.  The incident was one of several which marked his experiences of the DNC, which also included the police ""stomping out"" religious ministers tied to the counterculture movement. That violence, Mr Peck told the BBC, stands in stark contrast to today. Social media and the immediate spread of news could create a public relations disaster if police were seen to be too aggressive. ""Back then, there was a real delay in getting news out. Now, it's essentially instantaneous,"" Mr Peck said. ""That's a big difference.""  Don Rose, who in 1968 was a spokesman for the National Mobilization Committee to End the War, one of the main protest groups, told the BBC that an even more significant difference was the Vietnam War itself.  That war, unlike the Gaza war, saw tens of thousands of Americans drafted, many of whom were killed or wounded overseas.  ""The country was far more divided on the Vietnam War at that time. The protests expanded greatly because of the draft,"" said Mr Rose, now 93.  ""We were protesting at a convention that would nominate someone who could end the war with the stroke of a pen,"" he added.  The Democratic Party at the time was also deeply divided over the war, and when delegates arrived at the DNC of 1968, they had no idea who would be leaving with the nomination.   When then-vice president Hubert Humphrey was finally chosen as nominee over anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy, some in the audience even shouted “No!”. ""The convention was totally divided, and at war with itself,"" explained Mr Sautter. ""For [Kamala] Harris and Walz, it's totally unified."" Mr Peck, for his part, said that more recent versions of the DNC can no longer be called ""nominating conventions"". ""These are just confirmation conventions,"" he said. ""They confirm what the people in states did at the primary levels. That's really different."" Ultimately, Hubert Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 election to Republican Richard Nixon. Looking back, Mr Sautter - who will be watching the convention on TV this year - believes that the protests of 1968 had an impact on the US that could never be replicated in 2024. ""People who watched were totally radicalised by it, and many, many more people became involved in trying to stop the war,"" he said. ""A whole generation, whether they were there or not, were marked by it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8erk37yn2no,"Israeli strike in Gaza kills more than 70, hospital head says",Israel says it targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants embedded in the Gaza City school - one of several hit recently.,11 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.446200,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Israeli air strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City has killed more than 70 people, the director of a hospital has told the BBC. Fadl Naeem, head of al-Ahli Hospital where many of the casualties were taken, said those were the victims who had been identified so far, with the remains of many others so badly disfigured that identification was difficult. An Israeli military spokesman said al-Taba’een school ""served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility"", which Hamas denies.  The strike has been criticised by Western powers, as well as regional countries which have said it shows Israel has no desire to reach a ceasefire or end the Gaza war.  Israel has attacked several such shelters in Gaza in the past few weeks. According to the United Nations, 477 out of 564 school buildings in Gaza had been directly hit or damaged as of 6 July, with more than a dozen targeted since. Al-Taba’een school housed more 1,000 people - having recently received dozens of displaced people from the town of Beit Hanoun, after the Israeli army ordered them to leave their homes. The building also served as a mosque and the Israeli strike hit during dawn prayers, witnesses said.  Jaafar Taha, a student who lives near the school, told the BBC the sound of the bombing was followed by screaming and noise.  ""'Save us, save us,' they were screaming,"" he said. ""The scene was horrific. There were body parts everywhere and blood covering the walls."" Salim Oweis, spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC the attack was ""really outrageous"". ""All those schools are really packed with civilians, children, mothers and families, who are taking refuge in any empty space whether it's a school or it's a mosque, whatever it is, even in hospital yards.""   Israel's military said it had ""precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the al-Taba'een school"". A statement by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency said ""at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists"" were ""eliminated"" in the attack. An earlier statement by the IDF said ""approximately 20 Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants"" had been ""operating"" at the compound. Earlier estimates of the number of dead were also in the dozens, with the Hamas-run health ministry's ambulance service saying more than 60 had been killed, according to AP. The civil defence agency put the number at more than 90.  The BBC cannot independently verify figures from either side.  The Israeli spokesman said the casualty figures released by Hamas officials ""do not align with the information held by the IDF, the precise munitions used, and the accuracy of the strike"". Hamas described the attack as a ""horrific crime and a dangerous escalation"" in Israel's ""war of extermination against the Palestinian people"". Fatah, Hamas's political Palestinian rival in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said Israel's aim was ""to exterminate Palestinians through a policy of cumulative killing"".  The US said it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of civilian casualties and was seeking further details. A US National Security Council spokesman said: ""We know Hamas has been using schools as locations to gather and operate out of. ""But we have also said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must take measures to minimise civilian harm."" He said ""far too many civilians continue to be killed and wounded"", adding that it ""underscores the urgency of a ceasefire and hostage deal"". Philippe Lazzarini, head of Unrwa, the UN agency which helps Palestinians, said: ""It’s time for these horrors unfolding under our watch to end."" The French foreign ministry said it condemned the strike ""in the firmest of terms"". ""For several weeks, school buildings have been repeatedly targeted, with an intolerable number of civilian victims,"" it said. ""Israel must respect international humanitarian law,"" it added. The UK's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, said he was ""appalled"" by the ""tragic loss of life"" and stressed the need for ""an immediate ceasefire"". This strike has again drawn graphic attention to a controversial dynamic of the Gaza war.  Israel claims that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure to plan and carry out attacks, and that is why it has been targeting hospitals and schools - sites protected under international law.  Hamas has consistently denied the accusations. Whatever the case, these are both locations where Gazans displaced by the conflict have sought shelter – especially in schools, more than 80% of which have been directly hit or damaged.  Since early July, Israel has struck at least 13 of them - including four in a four-day period - each time declaring that they take steps to decrease the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions. Many of the schools were run by the UN before the war, and the UN has strongly condemned the strikes.  This seems a particularly deadly incident. No doubt it will increase pressure for a ceasefire, but the reaction of regional mediators suggests concern that it could further set back struggling efforts to achieve one. Egypt, one of the mediators, said Israel’s “deliberate killing” of unarmed Palestinians showed that Israel lacked the political will to end the war.  Qatar, also involved in ceasefire talks, demanded an urgent international investigation.  Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in an attack on Israel on 7 October, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  That attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the current war. More than 39,790 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkmzr22y14o,Three things the Democrats have avoided so far at the DNC,"What they have tried to avoid says as much about their weaknesses as what they choose to highlight, writes Anthony Zurcher.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.551559,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Modern political conventions tend to be slickly produced, carefully stage-managed events. And despite its struggles with staying on schedule and the unusual way its presidential nominee was chosen, this year’s Democratic gathering in Chicago has been no different. The Democrats on the convention stage have tried to put their best foot forward by talking about Kamala Harris’s qualifications and character, her plan for the economy and issues on which the party has broad public support, like abortion rights and healthcare. But what they don’t talk about – the issues and areas they have largely tried to avoid, at least so far – says as much about their electoral strategies and weakness as what they choose to highlight. Here are three notable omissions halfway through the party extravaganza. Four years ago, amidst the mass protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, the Democratic Party – and the nation as a whole – engaged in a sometimes animated debate about institutional racism and how American history is presented. While many mainstream Democrats avoided the aggressive calls to “defund the police”, most engaged in the discussion of how America could take steps to address what they viewed as the corrosive legacy of slavery in the nation’s businesses, classrooms and government, including by promoting DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion More recently, the issue of transgender rights has been an animating force among segments of the Democratic coalition – particularly in the face of Republican efforts to limit or prohibit the ability of children to receive gender care. Neither topic has received much attention in the Democratic convention arena so far. There was an emotional tribute to the civil rights movement early on Monday that culminated in a wheelchair-bound Jesse Jackson – who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s – taking the stage. But DEI and other remedies have received short shrift. “DEI has become a dog-whistle code” used to undermine minorities in powerful positions, said Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president of the National Council of Negro Women, which is organising voter outreach efforts in presidential battleground states. “Our country was founded on opportunities for all men and all women, but we're not hearing that now, because a lot of people don't want to alienate a certain base of folk that are afraid of this.” At this convention, alienating the fewest number of potential voters has been the name of the game. And while abortion rights have been a daily focus at the convention, transgender issues – the other hot-button social topic currently - have been largely ignored in the programming that makes national television. Ms Arline-Bradley warns that by not talking about questions of equity and inclusion, the problems will linger. “We should talk about them, because this party is the most inclusive and diverse party,” she said. “Show it, activate it and live by those values.” The last Democratic convention in 2020 was largely virtual – conducted in empty halls and television studios - due to the Covid pandemic. In 2016, when thousands of Democrats gathered in Philadelphia, the rifts within the party were on full display. Supporters of Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, who finished second behind Hillary Clinton for that year’s nomination, repeatedly disrupted the proceedings and organised protests around the convention hall. The party was divided on topics like universal healthcare, free college tuition and, more broadly, whether Democrats should rely on support from deep-pocketed donors, big business and what Mr Sanders labelled the “corporate oligarchy”. Those divisions still exist. Mr Sanders gave a speech Tuesday night railing against the corrupting influence of money in politics. But his speech was immediately followed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who bragged about being a billionaire, and venture capitalist and former American Express chief executive Ken Chenault. The big tent, at least for now, covered obvious differences of policy and opinion. Another current area of sharp divide within the party is US military support for Israel amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. Thousands of protesters have demonstrated outside the convention’s security perimeter, but the intense disagreements have received little attention inside the convention hall. Mr Sanders received applause when he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and Joe Biden turned some heads when he said in his speech on Monday that protesters “have a point” when they say there have been too many civilian deaths. But all this is a far cry from 2016, when some antiwar convention attendees booed former four-star General John Allen and former Secretary of Defence and CIA Director Leon Panetta during their speeches. Ever since undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border surged early in the Biden presidency, the subject of immigration has been a liability for Democrats. Republicans have blamed the administration’s policies for encouraging the historic rise in border incursions, and the flood of new arrivals – many of whom have been transported by conservative governors to populous Democratic cities – has strained public services. The Harris campaign appears to recognise her vulnerability on the issue. One of its first television adverts blamed Donald Trump for sinking bipartisan border-security legislation earlier this year and touted Ms Harris’s record prosecuting “transnational gangs, the drug cartels and the human traffickers” while she was California’s attorney general. But immigration appears to be an issue the Harris team would rather talk about in 50-second television adverts than from the stage in Chicago. The topic has got a few lines here and there, but compared to the 2020 convention – when Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration was a primary focus of attack – the silence has been conspicuous. Reports suggest this could change on Wednesday night, with some speakers due to address the issue."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx3239x66o,UN vehicle carrying Irish troops damaged in strike,"Eight troops, including six from Ireland, were on an armed patrol when there was a drone or air attack.",11 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.656102,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A United Nations (UN) patrol vehicle with six Irish soldiers on board was caught up in an air attack in a village in south Lebanon on Saturday. Eight troops, including six Irish and two Polish, were on an armed patrol when there was a drone or air attack on a village. Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said none of the soldiers were injured in the attack, but damage was caused to the vehicle in which they were travelling. Speaking in Dublin on Sunday, Mr Martin said the incident is still under investigation. In a statement, the Defence Forces said the attack happened at about 20:00 local time.  It explained the two-vehicle patrol in the IRISHPOLBATT area of operations in UNIFIL south Lebanon was ""caught in an explosive blast of unknown origin"". ""The Defence Forces can confirm all personnel are safe and accounted for,"" it said.  There were no casualties, and both vehicles and all personnel recovered to the Irish position of UNP 245."" It said that the124th Infantry Battalion will ""continue to conduct framework operations and remain the eyes and ears in South Lebanon for the international community"". Providing details of the incident, Mr Martin said: ""Essentially about eight soldiers, two armoured vehicles, six Irish and two Polish, they were on routine patrol and there was an attack, either drone or airstrike on the village that they were patrolling through. ""They had come out, it seems, from the other end of the village. And shrapnel or whatever appears to have pierced the vehicles."" Mr Martin said: ""We have ideas as to who would have made that particular attack but I would say at this stage, we will be making representations on foot of this, on the basis that both the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) and Hezbollah must fulfil their obligations to peacekeepers."" There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran.  Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. The Tánaiste said there are ""thousands of peacekeepers in Lebanon to keep the peace"".  ""It's the most noble, objective thing to do and we take the full protection of our soldiers very seriously,"" he said.  Mr Martin said he will receive further information later on Sunday about the incident.  ""It is a serious incident and one I am very concerned about,"" he said.  ""It illustrates the danger of a wider escalation of the war to Lebanon in terms of the danger to peacekeepers and the civil population in Lebanon,"" Mr Martin added.  ""And it's matter of greatest concern."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0e5w7l96o,"Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank, together","In the hills of the West Bank, Palestinian shepherds and Israeli activists unite to face down settler violence.",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:54.742857,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Like every morning, there was tension.  It crackled in the air like static. So much was happening lately that only a fool would walk into the hills and not be on their guard.  The sun was already high, pulsing heat across the stillness of the land. There was the sound of the animals’ bells, men and boys whistling to call in the dogs.  High on the hill opposite was the Jewish settlement of Rotem. Close by was an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) post. There to protect the settlers.  Anybody looking down would see the gathering at Ahmad Daraghme’s home: the Palestinian shepherd; the Israeli activists who support him; the foreign journalists with their camera. Chatting to Ahmad was a 71-year-old Jewish man who regularly accompanies the shepherd into the hills, in spite of violence and harassment.  A man who, I sense, is not going to back down from any fight he believes to be righteous. “When I am convinced that my positions are true, I am ready to fight for my beliefs. Call it stubborn? All right,” says Gil Alexander. He belongs to the Jordan Valley Activists, a group of Israelis committed to protecting Palestinians. They accompany shepherds to and from the grazing lands.  Maybe the settlers would appear around al-Farisiyah this morning, maybe not. The harassment was more frequent since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping 251.  Settler violence that had been going on for years in the West Bank was escalating sharply, aimed, the Palestinians believe, at driving them off the land.  According to OCHA - the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs - there have been more than 1,000 attacks by settlers against Palestinians since October, with at least 1,390 people - including 660 children - displaced. Lethal violence has frequently accompanied the attacks. OCHA recorded 107 that led to Palestinian fatalities and injuries, 859 causing damage to Palestinian property.   Thousands of trees and saplings belonging to Palestinians have been destroyed. Farmers like Ahmad describe how access to water for families, crops and herds is regularly blocked or limited. International attention has been focused on Gaza, but the scale of settler violence prompted the US, the EU and Britain to impose sanctions on some settler leaders and, for the first time, against entire settler outposts. The activists in the Jordan Valley understand that the important thing is to stay calm. No matter how much provocation there is.  Gil Alexander knows what the settlers are capable of, even when no resistance is offered. He has the scars to prove it. But this morning he is upbeat. “A day like this,” he says, “it makes me feel good. If we can prevent attacks that gives me satisfaction.”   Gil has become a good friend of Ahmad Daraghme, who’s been harassed repeatedly. Ahmad accuses the Israeli army and police of taking the side of the settlers, a claim supported by numerous reports by Israeli and Palestinian human rights activists. Pointing to the hills, around him, down to the main road, Ahmad says: “The problem is…all this land is forbidden for us. This hill is forbidden, all of it is forbidden. This situation is a mess: it doesn’t matter if we have permission or we don't, they are always creating problems for us.” We climbed up into the hills, over rocks and gullies, until a valley opened out below us. The land was auburn coloured, covered with dried stalks of recently cut corn, good fodder for hungry sheep.  Ahmad was ahead of us on his donkey, leading the flock towards the grazing land, as his forefathers had done for generations.  A mountain deer flickered through the heat haze and vanished. The picture was of a pastoral eden. In reality it is a bitter battleground. Last December Gil Alexander and another activist were with Ahmad when settlers attacked at night. They were badly beaten and pepper sprayed.  In an incident elsewhere in the valley Gil collapsed to the ground trying to prevent a settler from scattering a Palestinian flock. He has experienced constant threats. The fact that he is a devout religious Jew infuriates the settlers, who believe the West Bank - the ancient lands of Judea and Samaria - belong to the Jewish people. Gil is the son of French Jews and emigrated to Israel when he was 20. His father fought in the French Resistance against the Nazis. “I feel like a representative of a humanitarian religious Judaism,” Gil says. ""There are few today in Israel."" The Palestinians like Ahmad Daraghme have lived under occupation since Israel conquered the territory in the Six Day War of 1967.  Since then over 160 settlements have been built in the Occupied Territories - including East Jerusalem - with around 700,000 Jewish residents. There are approximately three million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. For Gil Alexander, who describes himself as a Zionist, Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders. Any settlements in the West Bank should only exist with Palestinian consent.   ”We can love this land without being the owners, the sole owners of the land… In order that we are not constantly holding the local population by force, we should give away part of this land, in the hope that we will be able to get there freely later on.”  Gil says only this can avoid “the national religious conflict that has existed for 100 years, since Zionism existed, between the Palestinian population and the Jewish population”. Although Gil believes “nothing is impossible” such an idea seems far-fetched in the bitter politics of the present. Israel now has the most right-wing government in its history. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the support of pro-settler parties for the survival of his governing coalition.  Recently Israel’s far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, spoke of ""mega-strategic"" moves to expand settlement activity with government funding. Three weeks ago the government declared nearly 3,000 acres in the Jordan Valley as ""state land"" - the largest such amount in three decades.  It comes on top of a similar declaration of nearly 2,000 acres in the area in March.  The top UN court - the International Court of Justice - has described the Israeli occupation as ""de-facto annexation"" and in breach of the Convention on the Eradication of Racial Discrimination which condemns “racial segregation and apartheid"". Ahmad Daraghme knows how it works on the ground.  Speaking of his old grazing pastures, he says: “All these areas, all these places, we are not allowed to reach them. Some have been planted with olive trees. Some became reserved areas…They want us to leave this area. They want to be here. They don't want us to be here.” The political momentum is with the settlers.  Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, recently voted by a majority of 68 to nine to reject a Palestinian state on the West Bank on the basis that it “would pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilise the region”.  Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that Israeli security control over the West Bank is essential for the country’s safety. To someone like Shai Rosengarten, people like the Jordanian Valley Activists are ""radicals"" who should stay out of the West Bank.  He says “the settlements in Israel are very important, because we think that in Israel, we have to connect to our heritage”. Coincidentally, like Gil he is descended from Holocaust survivors.  His grandfather arrived in Israel from Poland in the years after the war. Shai is a leading figure in the Zionist organisation Im Tirtzu which supports the settlements. Settler violence, he says, is only carried out by a minority. He claims that what he calls ""radical"" human rights activists are the problem. “We see them as radical. And we see their activity as interrupting military activity. So this is very bad for the area.”  I asked Shai if what he really meant was that it was bad for the settlers? “No, I actually mean that they are interrupting military activity. Of course, they're trying to harass settlers, but they're also trying to harass soldiers. And we have many examples of those kinds of activities coming in front of Israeli soldiers, and just, you know, put their camera in front of their face.  ""And you know, this is very, very harming and this is very bad for the Israeli soldiers that need to concentrate on what is happening."" Gil adamantly rejects such a characterisation and argues that he is defending true Jewish values.  He is part of an Israeli minority who have little political influence at the moment. But standing in the shade of an Acacia tree, with Ahmad rounding up the sheep and goats to corral them for the night, Gil Alexander insisted there was hope for a peaceful end to a conflict that he believed had no military solution.  “We have no choice… War, it’s obvious, will provide nothing. From war to war, we are weaker and weaker… Even our strength has limits.” With additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78l44xvy1mo,Malawi ex-president plots comeback in next election,Peter Mutharika is picked to run in next year's presidential election by the main opposition DPP.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:59.848638,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Malawi's former president, Peter Mutharika, has been chosen to lead the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) into next year's presidential election. It marks a comeback for the 84-year-old, who governed Malawi for six years and later suggested he would not run for office again. He surprised many with a change of heart, saying recently that his supporters want him to save the country from being ruined by President Lazarus Chakwera. Mr Mutharika lost to Mr Chakwera in 2020, in a re-run that was ordered by the country's Constitutional Court after it annulled the previous year's election. Judges had ruled that there was widespread tampering in the 2019 vote, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on ballot papers, and that Mr Mutharika's declared victory in that poll was void. Malawi's judiciary were praised for their bravery in refusing to accept a second-rate election, and the political fallout in the former president's party has been ugly. Following a period of internal squabbling, the DPP has expelled several members including those who wanted to challenge Mr Mutharika for the party presidency, paving the way for him to be re-elected party leader unopposed. Monday's announcement that he had won the official endorsement of his party as its presidential candidate was largely a formality. This means Mr Mutharika and Mr Chakwera will square off against each other at the polls for the third time, each having won and lost once in the past. Mr Mutharika told party supporters he was ready to regain power ""to remove an incompetent government which sees nothing, hears nothing and does nothing"". He appears to enjoy the solid support of his party, but critics say it should have identified a younger, more energetic leader as its torchbearer in next year’s polls. His rival, the incumbent Mr Chakwera, is 15 years his junior. President Chakwera came into office promising ""to clear the rubble of corruption"", to create a million jobs for the unemployed youth and to ensure food security so that all Malawians have three meals a day. His government admits it has found it hard to deliver on those campaign promises, but blames that on Covid-19 at the start of its term of office, natural disasters such as cyclones and the economic downturn caused by the war in Ukraine. Government officials, including Information Minister Moses Kunkuyu, have repeatedly said, even with these difficulties, the present administration has outperformed its predecessors by creating systems that make it hard for corruption to flourish. Successes include the reintroduction of train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades, helping to reduce the cost of transporting goods. Major road construction is also under way, particularly in the capital, Lilongwe. The ruling Malawi Congress Party (MCP) will have to defend that record at the polls, and could yet make age a key campaign issue - questioning whether former President Mutharika has both the physical strength and mental capacity to govern once more.

It was not known whether the incident was connected to the Israel-Gaza conflict, with police previously trying to identify whether any offences had been committed. Signs on Magna Road, Mountbatten Roundabout, Ringwood Road and New Road were affected. BCP Council previously confirmed that Bournemouth was still twinned with Netanya. A spokesperson from the authority said: “The road signs indicating that the Israeli town of Netanya is twinned with Bournemouth have all been replaced following their disappearance earlier in the year. “The incident was reported to the police, but we are waiting further information on the potential identity of the offenders.” Dorset Police has been contacted for comment.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgewyx7pn5o,Iran keeps region guessing as it mulls revenge attack,Speculation swirls about how Iran might retaliate to Israel's alleged assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran.,9 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.036046,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"In the Saudi city of Jeddah on Wednesday, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of 57 countries, held an emergency meeting at Iran’s request to discuss, among other things, the assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. The gathering was an opportunity for Iran, whose Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed “harsh punishment” for the killing, to lay out the reasons for an expected retaliation.  Both Iran and Hamas say the 31 July assassination was carried out by Israel, which has not commented but is widely believed to have been behind it. Baqeri Ali Bagheri Kani, the acting Iranian foreign minister, said his country had “no choice” but to respond, and that this would take place “at the right time and in the appropriate shape”.  Mr Kani also described the possible Iranian reaction as “not only a defence of its own sovereignty and national security” but also a “defence of the stability and security of the entire region”. Haniyeh was killed in a heavily protected guesthouse run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s elite military force, as he visited Tehran for the inauguration of the country’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian, a humiliating breach of Iranian security. Since then, every sign, speech, or statement from Iran has been closely watched for an indication of how and when it might respond, amid concerns the retaliation could lead to a wider conflict with Israel.  But Mr Kani offered no clues and, with apparent limited intelligence by the West, it remains unclear what Iran could be planning to do. In April, a strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital, Damascus, killed eight IRGC officers, another attack believed to have been carried out by Israel - and another embarrassing setback for Iran.  After days of telegraphing its intentions, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel; almost all of them were intercepted by Israel and a US-led coalition, and the retaliation had no significant impact. Last week, American officials suggested that this time, Iran might have been preparing a bigger operation, perhaps in attempt to avoid repeating that failure.  Recent media reports, however, suggest that details of how Haniyeh’s killing was carried out – possibly from inside Iran with local assistance instead of a precise air strike from outside – combined with the fact that no Iranians were killed and diplomatic efforts from Western and Arab countries, might have forced Tehran to reconsider its plans. The Jordanian foreign minister made a rare visit to Iran earlier this week and, on Wednesday, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Mr Pezeshkian and, according to the French presidency, urged him to “do everything to avoid a new military escalation”. Meanwhile, there is also the wait for another expected attack on Israel, from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political movement in Lebanon.  The group has vowed to respond to the killing by Israel of senior commander Fuad Shukr, which happened just hours before Haniyeh’s assassination, in its stronghold of Dahiya, in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Concerns of a major conflict in Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah stepped up its strikes against Israel, a day after the Hamas attacks on 7 October.  Most of the violence has been contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border, with both Hezbollah and Israel still indicating they are not interested in an all-out war.  So far, the group has mainly targeted Israeli military facilities, although its attacks are increasingly more sophisticated and hitting positions deeper inside the country. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who has promised a “strong” and “effective” response, described Shukr as one of the “strategic minds of the resistance” and said they had spoken on the phone an hour before his assassination.  In the past, Hezbollah retaliated to the killings of top commanders by launching barrages of rockets at Israel. Having such a high-profile figure assassinated in their base in the Lebanese capital will likely result in a more symbolic response, although almost certain to be within what the group describes as the rules of engagement. In Lebanon, where people still remember the devastation caused by the 2006 war between the Hezbollah and Israel, many fear they are being dragged into a conflict that is not in the nation’s interest. But a damaged Hezbollah is not in Iran’s interest either. With its precision guided missiles and attack drones, Hezbollah is a key element of Iran’s deterrence, right on Israel’s borders.  Israel sees the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat, and Hezbollah would probably play a vital role in Iran’s response if its facilities came under Israeli attack. Hezbollah is the main group in the so-called Axis of Resistance, an Iranian-backed alliance across the region that includes the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq, which have also carried out attacks on Israel and Western targets since October.  It is not known whether Iran and its proxies will co-ordinate their response, although reports in US media suggest Hezbollah may act independently, and first. This week, Gen Michael Kurilla, the head of the US Central Command, visited Israel to assess security preparations, and the US is expected to, again, lead an effort to protect Israel in the case of an Iranian attack.  And the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to “exact a heavy price for any act of aggression against us, from whatever quarter”. As the wait continues, flights in both Israel and Lebanon are being cancelled or suspended, airlines are avoiding the countries’ airspaces and foreign governments are urging their citizens to leave. Some people are preparing for war and the region could, deliberately or by accident, slide into one."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywey7z8edo,'Squad' member Ilhan Omar holds off primary challenge,Two other members of the progressive group of Democrats lost primaries earlier this year.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.114912,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar has fended off a primary election challenge in Minnesota, avoiding a fate met by other members of her political ""Squad"". Ms Omar faced three challengers in the primary contest to determine the party's nominee, and will now continue on to the November election in the state's solidly Democratic-leaning 5th District.  The race had been closely watched after successful primary challengers elsewhere took down two fellow members of the ""Squad"" - a group of progressive Democrats who have been among the most vocal critics in Congress of Israel's war in Gaza. “We run the politics of joy,"" Ms Omar told supporters on Tuesday. She went on to say this was a case of fighting for healthcare, housing, and for a ""peaceful and equitable world”. Hers was one of several primary races on Tuesday in Connecticut, Wisconsin and Vermont, as well as Minnesota. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar also won her own primary in Minnesota. Ms Omar won her contest with more than 67,000 votes - or 56% of the overall share - according to tallies reported by US outlets, which say 99% of votes have been counted. Coming second was Don Samuels, a former member of the Minneapolis City Council who also narrowly lost to Ms Omar in 2022. He received just under 43% of the votes this time and said he was ""very disappointed"". Earlier this month, fellow ""Squad"" member Cori Bush of Missouri lost her primary race, and in June, Jamaal Bowman in New York was also defeated - both after pro-Israel groups poured millions into those races backing other Democrats.  The pair were elected in 2020 amid a year marked by racial justice protests after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.  Ms Omar did not suffer the same downfall as her political peers.  A so-called super-pac operated by the pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee appears to have stayed out of her race. It had spent millions in races against Mr Bowman and Ms Bush, according to data from Open Secrets, which tracks money in politics.  Super-pacs are independent political action committees that can raise unlimited amounts of money to support an election candidate. The Intercept reported on Sunday that a last-minute effort by wealthy pro-Israel donors raised six-figure sums to help Mr Samuels. But opinion polls had been suggesting Ms Omar would fend off the challenge. One internal poll taken last month reportedly indicated she was ahead by 30 points.  Ms Omar has received help on the campaign trail from progressive Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is running for president.  Ms Omar, who was born in Somalia, is one of the first Muslims to be elected to the US Congress.  She had been an outspoken critic of Israel even before the war in Gaza.  She was removed by the Republican-controlled House from the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2023 over a number of comments she had made about Israel.   Democrats and Ms Omar said at the time it was revenge, after two Republicans were ousted from committees in 2020 when Democrats held a House majority. In 2019, Ms Omar seemed to suggest that Israel demanded ""allegiance"" from American lawmakers and that any criticism is viewed as antisemitic. She implied money was behind the support for Israel.  Ms Omar apologised for those remarks. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9l33pz493o,Call for Labour to suspend Clive Lewis over X post,An antisemitism group is calling for the suspension of an MP after comments he made on social media.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.213118,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An antisemitism group has called for the Labour MP, Clive Lewis, to be suspended from his party. It follows a post Mr Lewis wrote on X, in which he claimed a link between attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and what he called “rising Islamophobia” in the UK.  The co-director of the Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) group has described the comment as ""incendiary"" and ""inflammatory"". Mr Lewis declined to comment. A Labour spokesperson said: “All complaints are treated seriously and thoroughly assessed in line with our rules and procedures.” In the post on Saturday, Mr Lewis, who is the MP for Norwich South, shared a link to a report in the Guardian newspaper. The article said dozens of people had been reported dead following an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza.  Alongside the link, Mr Lewis wrote: “The link between the daily inhumanity being (sic) metted out to Palestinians and rising Islamophobia in the UK, are not unconnected. “The inhumanity being shown to one is giving ‘permission’ for the other. These actions diminish us all.” Alex Hearn is the co-director of LAAS, which was started by Labour members to combat what they saw as the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Labour Party. He said he had written to the Labour Party, calling for Mr Lewis to be suspended. “I put in the complaint because we have been seeing a pattern from the far right and across elements of the left that have been blaming Zionists and Israelis for the unrest that has been going on across the country,” he said. “The conflict going on thousands of miles away has no connection to the domestic cases that we have. “In my opinion this is conspiracy fantasy. It’s extremely irresponsible that a Labour official should be pouring fuel on the fire in this way.” Mr Lewis’s comment came after the arrests of hundreds of people in connection with riots and anti-immigration protests across the UK. The unrest followed the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July. Mr Hearn said: “I think his [Mr Lewis’s] comments are dangerous because it’s a fantasy that blames racism against Muslims on Jews thousands of miles away in a different country. “When communities are attacking each other it’s awful. What our officials should be doing is calming things down. Mr Lewis took part in an anti-racism protest in Norwich on Saturday, in which up to 400 people gathered in the city centre. The demonstration was organised as part of a national day of protest by Norwich Stand Up to Racism and Protest with Pride Mr Lewis addressed the crowd, three days after attending another counter-protest near a hotel housing asylum seekers on the outskirts of Norwich. A spokesperson for the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, was questioned by the BBC about Mr Lewis's comments. They said it was ""explicitly clear that violence has no place in UK society"". When asked if Mr Lewis's comments were antisemitic, they said it was not their role to get into individual discipline.  They added: ""The UK’s position is that we must have more aid into Gaza."" It is understood the Labour Party is taking no further action in this case. Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

It is understood that the current requirement, that a certain proportion of union members need to vote for strike action for it be legal, would no longer apply. Shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake is quoted as saying that ''it will be businesses and consumers that pay the price, and growth that suffers"". ''Half of Labour MPs in pay of unions” is the headline for the Daily Mail. The paper says that, based on figures in the MPs’ register of interests, 213 of the 404 Labour MPs took union money to help them fight the election. A Labour spokesperson said all donations were declared in line with parliamentary and Electoral Commission rules. Workers who are regularly contacted by their boss out of hours could get thousands of pounds in compensation, according to the Times. It says the government is looking to Ireland and Belgium for inspiration on its proposed ''right to switch off'' policy. The paper says that although it is unlikely that employees could take legal action for this alone, it could be used as an aggravating factor in a broader claim against their employer. A government source said the details were still being drawn up. A former Victims' Commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, has told the Daily Express that men who repeatedly abuse women should be sentenced as quickly as those who have been prosecuted for the recent disorder in England. Dame Vera writes that male violence against women and girls is ""almost always poorly and slowly dealt with by police and the wider criminal justice system, which offers no deterrent''. The Daily Telegraph also reports that the prime minister has been urged to rethink his refusal to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles produced in the UK to hit targets deep inside Russia. The paper has spoken to four former Conservative defence secretaries, who say the UK is failing to provide Ukraine with the support it needs.  A Ministry of Defence spokesman tells the Telegraph there has been “no change in the UK’s position” when it comes to Storm Shadow missiles. An investigation by the i paper has found that thousands of children and teenagers have had vapes or drinks spiked in the past three years. The figures come from a Freedom of Information request to police forces in England and Wales. The paper says there is particular concern about vapes being laced with the synthetic drug, spice.  Pakistan's jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan has applied to become the next chancellor of Oxford University, according to papers including the Guardian. One of his advisers is said to have confirmed his candidacy for the election in October. The paper says Mr Khan is an Oxford graduate and previously served as chancellor of the University of Bradford for seven years. ''Bank on record traffic for big August getaway'', is the warning in the Daily Mirror. The motoring organisation the RAC says its data indicates that 19 million trips will be made between this Friday and Monday, which would make it the busiest August bank holiday since its records began in 2015.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07e99ver7ro,Israel accepts proposal to attend ‘urgent’ new ceasefire talks,"A proposal for a new round of talks to take place on 15 August was presented by the US, Egypt and Qatar.",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.473542,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has agreed to send negotiators to a new round of talks over a ceasefire and hostage release deal, after a diplomatic push from the United States, Egypt and Qatar. The three nations released a joint statement on Thursday pushing for the talks to take place between Israel and Hamas on 15 August in Doha or Cairo. Hamas is yet to respond.  The statement said a ""framework agreement"" was ready and that it had ""only the details of implementation left to conclude”.  The push for new talks will be seen as an attempt by the US and its partners to stop regional tensions from spiralling out of control, after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week.  Iran, blaming Israel, has vowed a response - though Israel has not commented directly on the killing. The statement invited Israel and Hamas to restart talks ""to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay"". ""As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties,"" it said. The statement was signed by US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. It said the ""framework agreement"" was based on “principles” previously outlined by President Biden on 31 May - which proposed a deal that would start with a full ceasefire and the release of a number of hostages. The UN Security Council endorsed that framework. European Union chief Ursula Von der Leyen said she “strongly” supported the efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement. ""We need a ceasefire in Gaza now. That's the only way to save lives, restore hope for peace, and secure the return of hostages,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK ""fully endorses"" the plan for talks, adding that it welcomed ""the tireless efforts of our partners in Qatar, Egypt and the United States"". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Thursday evening he had spoken with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant to brief him on changes to US forces in the region and ""reinforce my ironclad support for Israel’s defence"". ""I also stressed the importance of concluding a ceasefire deal in Gaza that releases the hostages,"" he said. Despite numerous rounds of talks, the challenge of reaching a ceasefire and hostage release agreement has so far proved elusive. Hamas official Osama Hamdan said in June that the group was pushing for a “permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal [of Israeli troops] from the Gaza Strip” and a swap-deal involving Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said the conflict can only stop once Hamas is defeated. On Thursday, Israel continued its bombardment of the Gaza strip. Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence force said it hit two schools, killing more than 18 people. The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas command centres. Any proposed talks could be made even more difficult by Hamas’ decision to elect Yahya Sinwar as its new leader, replacing Haniyeh. Sinwar, who Israel holds responsible for the planning and execution of the 7 October attacks, is seen as one of the group's most extreme figures. Amid fears of an attack from Iran or its allies, Israel’s security cabinet met in an underground bunker on Thursday, instead of its usual meeting place, Israel’s Channel 13 reported."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjwdl2e73wo,Disqualified Eurovision star will not be prosecuted,Dutch singer Joost Klein had been accused of threatening behaviour towards a female camera operator.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.555979,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Dutch singer Joost Klein, who was disqualified from the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, will not be prosecuted over the ""backstage incident"" that led to his dismissal, Swedish authorities have said. Klein was banned from the grand final hours before it took place in Malmö on 11 May, after a female camera operator accused him of ""threatening"" behaviour. However, on Monday, the Swedish prosecution authority said it could not prove that Klein ""had any such intention"". Senior prosecutor Fredrik Jönssom said the singer had made ""a movement that hit the woman’s film camera"" but that the course of events ""was fast and was perceived differently by the witness of the incident"". “Today I have closed the investigation because I cannot prove that the act was capable of causing serious fear,"" he added. The singer's management said they were ""extremely happy and relieved"" that the case had been abandoned. ""The last few months have been terribly difficult,"" they said in a statement.  ""Finally we can say it out loud: There was never a reason for this case."" The musician's response was more light-hearted: He posted a compilation of happy dog videos to his Instagram story and updated his biography to read ""Eurovision 2025"". Klein had been one of the favourites to win the 2024 contest with techno anthem, Europapa. The song was dedicated to his father, who died of cancer when Klein was 12. Before he died, Klein had promised to enter Eurovision on his behalf. However, the singer's plan fell apart when he was suspended during dress rehearsals the day before the grand final.  A day later, Swedish police confirmed that a man had been reported for making ""unlawful threats"" to a member of the camera crew, and Klein was disqualified.  Dutch broadcaster Avrotros, which is responsible for arranging the country's Eurovision entry, called the move ""disproportionate"". It said that Klein had been filmed immediately after coming off stage ""against clearly made agreements"" and against his repeated indications that he did not want to be on camera. Responding to the Swedish prosecutor's decision to drop the case, the broadcaster said it would call a meeting with contest organisers the EBU to express its dissatisfaction. ""From the beginning, we have said that this disqualification was unnecessary and disproportionate and so it now appears to be.  ""We are still deeply disappointed that the Europa adventure of Joost Klein and of the entire Netherlands was brutally ended in this way. ""The next step is to have a meeting with the EBU management about this matter at very short notice."" However, the EBU defended its original decision to expel Klein from the contest for ""inappropriate behaviour"". ""Like all responsible employers, we do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour and will always respond to any workplace issues that are reported to us,"" it said in a statement. Noting that the contest's internal investigation was separate to the police inquiry, it added: ""This new development therefore does not have any impact on our decision, which we stand by completely."" Klein's disqualification was not the only source of controversy at this year's contest. Israel's participation was widely criticised amid the ongoing Israel-Gaza war, with several pro-Palestinian protests taking place around Malmö Arena. Italy's Angelina Mango and Ireland's Bambie Thug were among contestants who complained of a ""tense"" and ""horrible"" atmosphere backstage.  Other entrants accused the Israeli delegation of filming them and posting clips online without their permission. Avrotros said it would raise ""other objections about the course of events behind the scenes"" during its meeting with the EBU. It noted that those complaints had previously been raised ""in a comprehensive letter of objection, which to date has remained unanswered"". ""The ball is now in the EBU’s court,"" it concluded. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyl3yg7wzzo,Behind the scenes as Hamas chose its new leader,The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf witnessed Hamas’s shadowy veterans gather in Qatar to vote for their new chief.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:05.918472,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Over the past week, watched by the world's media, the top leaders of Hamas descended on Qatar to choose a new political leader for their group. Delegates flooded in from across the Middle East after almost a year of fighting between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Some arrived shaken, having woken just days before to the news that the group's previous political leader - Ismail Haniyeh - had been killed in a blast in Tehran, allegedly by Israel. Haniyeh, who had overseen his group's negotiators in talks with Israel, played a crucial role in Hamas, balancing the militant wing's desire to take the fight to Israel with calls from some to reach a settlement and end the conflict. His position, it was clear, had to be filled quickly. At the mourning ceremony in Doha, Hamas leaders lined up shoulder to shoulder in a huge white tent with carpets and fancy chairs, decorated with pictures of Ismail Haniyeh. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to the movement’s late leader and his bodyguard. The scene was more than a memorial service - it signalled the end of an era and the beginning of a new, more extreme phase. This was not the first time I had witnessed Hamas’s top officials gather to choose a new leader after an unexpected funeral. Back in 2004 I witnessed them meet after Israel assassinated the group’s founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin – the meeting taking place in his house in Gaza. Less than a month later, Israel killed his successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi. But this time the backstage discussions reflected the extent of the crisis and challenges they are facing. Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back into Gaza. Since then, Israel’s military retaliation has killed more than 39,600 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and wounded tens of thousands more. More than half the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and almost the entire population has been displaced. Dissent against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, has been growing. The group itself has taken severe losses. On top of this, the killing of Ismail Haniyeh on 31 July in Tehran - a place he had always felt to be a safe haven - was a real shock for the organisation. Hamas is convinced that Haniyeh was killed by an anti-personnel missile while he was browsing on his phone. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have said a projectile with a 7kg warhead was used. Some Western media reports say he was killed by a bomb planted in the room beforehand.  Back at Haniyeh’s mourning ceremony in Doha, one man in his mid-60s with white hair and a short beard stood in a corner away from the spotlight. “Pay close attention to him,” a Hamas media officer told me. Who was he? “He is the shadowy man, Abu Omar Hassan,” he said. Abu Omar Hassan, or Mohamed Hassan Darwish, is the head of the Supreme Shura Council, the top consultative body in Hamas. According to Hamas’s constitution, he was in prime position to be the organisation’s interim head until elections which had been scheduled for next March. “He is the man of the big missions,” I was told. As the mourning ceremony ended, these leaders’ real work began. For two days, the movement’s veteran faces and shadowy figures held meetings in Doha, which has hosted Hamas’s political bureau since 2012, to elect a new leader. They chose Yahya Sinwar, already the group's leader inside Gaza since 2017. The choice may come as a surprise to many, but anyone following his career since Israel released him in the 2011 exchange deal for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit knew he was always likely to lead Hamas one day. No political leader in Hamas has ever been closer to the group’s armed wing. His brother Mohammed leads the largest Hamas military battalion, while Mohammed Deif - the elusive Hamas veteran who led its armed wing for two decades until Israel said it killed him last month - was his neighbour, friend, and classmate. The pair grew up together in Gaza's sprawling Khan Younis refugee camp. Despite all this, many may see appointing him to the most important position in Hamas as madness. Israel's security agencies believe Sinwar planned and executed the attack on southern Israel, and he is top of their wanted list. “Not all of the people inside Hamas leadership were in favour of the decision,” a senior Hamas official told me. “Some leaders raised their concerns, others pushed for a more moderate person. But in the end he got the majority of the votes.” Another Hamas official who attended the meetings said the movement felt unable to choose the powerful shadow operator Abu Omar Hassan because he had little public profile and was unknown outside the movement, whereas the 7 October attack had given Yahya Sinwar global notoriety. “Sinwar has become a trademark after 7 October and he has great popularity in the Arab and Islamic worlds,” the official said. “He enjoys close relations with the axis of resistance supported by Iran, and his appointment in the midst of the war sends a message of defiance to Israel.” The “axis of resistance” is a network of armed groups backed by Iran. Other members such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah also present threats to Israel. Many Arab and some Western officials urged Hamas against naming Sinwar as leader because of his connection to the 7 October attacks. He and the organisation he now leads are proscribed as terrorists by many governments in the West. “One of the reasons why we voted for him is because we want to honour him for masterminding the attacks” the official said. “October 7th belongs to him so he deserves to lead the movement.” Ten months on from that attack, all attempts to agree a ceasefire have so far failed. The BBC understands that the two main mediators - Qatar and Egypt - are working on a new ceasefire proposal. Leaks suggest the plan is based on convincing Iran not to respond militarily to the assassination of Haniyeh in its territory, in exchange for Israel ending its war in Gaza and withdrawing troops from the Philadelphi corridor. The Philadelphi Corridor is a buffer zone, only about 100m (330ft) wide in parts, which runs along the Gaza side of the 13km (8-mile) border with Egypt. Gaza's only other land border is with Israel itself. A Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told me in Doha: “Egyptian intelligence has already sent a team to Doha and there are meetings to formulate an action plan based on sparing the region a possible Iranian response… in exchange for a ceasefire.” For now, the drumbeat of conflict is only getting louder, with Sinwar, the most extremist figure in Hamas, set to lead the group for the next five years - if he survives the war."

""Blood on their hands"" is the headline in the Daily Mail, quoting the reaction of the families. The paper describes the findings as ""devastating"". The Daily Mirror's front page says, alongside Calocane's mugshot: ""They were told he could kill"".  Emma Webber, whose teenage son Barnaby was among the three people stabbed to death, tells the Sun that she felt ""visceral and genuine shock"" when reading the report.  Describing Calocane as ""evil, twisted, and vicious"", she accuses mental health services of ""washing their hands"" of him, leaving him free to carry out the attacks. The i reports that the government is drawing up plans to evacuate British nationals from across the Middle East in the event that an Iranian attack on Israel triggers a wider war in the region.  Whitehall sources tell the paper that officials are ""really, really concerned” about what they call an ""uncontrollable"" move towards escalation.  According to the Daily Telegraph, such a strike ""could come within days"", possibly before Gaza ceasefire talks resume on Thursday. The former home secretary, James Cleverly, tells the Daily Express that the government needs to ""get a grip, and fast"" on illegal migration, after more than 700 people crossed the Channel in a single day.  The Conservative leadership hopeful accuses Sir Keir Starmer of ""doing nothing"" to ""stop the boats"".  Downing Street insists it is working to ""smash the gangs responsible"". According to the Telegraph, one way Sir Keir is planning to do that is by working with his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni. The paper says he has expressed support for Ms Meloni's plans to overhaul the EU's police force, to make it focus on tackling people smuggling. Sir Keir is said to have floated the idea of officers from the UK conducting joint operations with Europol. Sources tell the Financial Times that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is considering turning to the private sector to pay for a £9bn highway and tunnel crossing the Thames.  The paper says that investors in the Lower Thames Crossing, which is due to link Kent and Essex, would receive returns from the toll road. The Guardian says that Labour MPs are closing their accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, because of what they call the spread of hate and disinformation on the platform.  One backbencher tells the paper that the website has become a ""megaphone for foreign adversaries and far-right fringe groups"" with an unnamed government minister saying they have cut down on posting on the site and are ""reluctant to return"". And the Times reports on the dying out of an age-old British tradition - a trip to the pub after work.  It highlights research by the think tank, the Work Foundation, which suggests that remote working, and a tendency among some younger employees to remain sober, mean that companies should instead host ""breakfast socials and away days"".  But, defending a post-work pint in its leader column, the paper says the pub "" remains the best place to let off steam, imbibe the wisdom of elders and turn workmates into lifelong friends"".

Chief executive Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down and will be replaced by Brian Niccol, the head of Mexican grill chain Chipotle, the company said.  The shake-up comes as Starbucks is grappling with a slump in sales amid a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Howard Schultz, a former executive who oversaw the growth of the coffee chain into a global powerhouse, said he believed Mr Niccol was ""the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history"".  ""He has my respect and full support,"" Mr Schultz said. Shares in Starbucks jumped more than 20% following the announcement. A change in leadership at the coffee chain has been brewing for the last two months, Starbucks board member Mellody Hobson told the Wall Street Journal. Last month, the firm said global sales fell 3% annually in the three months to the end of June amid weakness in the US and China. The company has faced criticism for long waits for drinks and a sharp rise in prices. Activist investors such as Elliott Investment Management, a firm known for taking stakes in companies and pushing for leadership and other changes, have also been piling on pressure. Mr Schultz had selected Mr Narasimhan, a former executive at PepsiCo and Reckitt, as his successor in 2022, who took up the reins full-time in March 2023. But despite his choice, Mr Schultz voiced concerns publicly about the direction of the company in the spring, after it reported an unexpectedly severe sales fall. Incoming boss Mr Niccol has led Chipotle since 2018, helping the brand recover from a crisis after food poisoning outbreaks.  Sales doubled during his tenure and the chain's share price surged from less than $7 to more than $50, as the burrito-maker opened nearly 1,000 new stores and introduced robotic grills and automated processors to make guacamole.  In recent months, it has been seen as a bright spot in the restaurant industry, where many businesses have reported customers cutting back. ""It's hard to leave such a great company and all of the talented people I've had the pleasure to work with, but I depart knowing the business is in great shape and poised for growth with a strong, experienced leadership team,"" Mr Niccol said.  Shares in Chipotle dropped more than 9% after his departure was announced. But Sharon Zackfia, an analyst at investment bank William Blair, said the new chief executive could be inheriting a tougher challenge at Starbucks than at Chipotle, noting that the company is both bigger and its problems more complex. ""While we cannot help but be more optimistic on today's news, we suspect the path to recapturing lost sales will be less linear than it was at Chipotle, which did not face boycott pressures, perceived value questions or material speed of service issues,"" she wrote. Starbucks saw its sales boom as the economy re-opened from the Covid pandemic lockdowns.  But the firm soon found itself embroiled in fight with staff in the US, thousands of whom have voted to join a union, tarnishing its progressive reputation.  Last year, after Starbucks sued the union for a social media post expressing ""solidarity"" with Palestinians, the dispute landed it in the middle of debates over Israel's war in Gaza, sparking global boycott calls. Starbucks has blamed misinformation about its views, after issuing a blanket statement condemning violence in the region."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxleqky15o,Last missing Israeli victim of Hamas attack declared dead,"Until now, no trace had been found of Bilha Yinon, whose house was burnt down on 7 October.",7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:06.186981,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The last person listed as missing from the Hamas attack on Israel 10 months ago has been identified as killed, Israeli authorities say. Bilha Yinon, 75, was murdered along with her husband, Yaakov, at their home in Netiv Haasara, when hundreds of gunmen from Gaza attacked communities in southern Israel on 7 October. The Yinons' home was burnt to the ground, and while Yaakov's remains were found, there was no trace of Bilha, although she was known to have been with him at the time.   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had now determined ""after complex testing"" of evidence in the area of the house that Bilha was killed. Previously even fingertip searches in the ash and debris had failed to find as much as a trace of Bilha's DNA. The couple's children had long accepted their mother was murdered on the day of the attack, but her death has only now been officially declared ""based on a combination of findings"", the IDF said. Bilha and Yaakov were together in their house, on the edge of the border with Gaza, when it was attacked on the morning of the invasion.  One of the couple's daughters, Maayan, said her father WhatsApped at the time to say he and Bilha were in a safe room and could hear shooting and rockets. ""The house got a direct hit and was on fire within minutes,"" Maayan told Israeli TV in February.  Virtually the whole structure was reduced to ash. Writing on X, Maoz Yinon a son of the couple, said his parents did not die in vain. ""They did not die for this war. They died for peace. ""I have no doubt in my heart that [Bilha Yinon] would be so proud of the journey my family are on - with Israeli and Palestinian partners - to create a path to peace, through hope and reconciliation,"" he said.  Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in the unprecedented attack, and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza and the ongoing war. More than 39,600 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry."

His half-brother, Salman, was about to become king – and Salman’s favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman, was preparing for power. The prince, known simply by his initials MBS and then just 29 years old, had big plans for his kingdom, the biggest plans in its history; but he feared that plotters within his own Saudi royal family could eventually move against him. So at midnight one evening that month, he summoned a senior security official to the palace, determined to win his loyalty. The official, Saad al-Jabri, was told to leave his mobile phone on a table outside. MBS did the same. The two men were now alone. The young prince was so fearful of palace spies that he pulled the socket out of the wall, disconnecting the only landline telephone. According to Jabri, MBS then talked about how he would wake his kingdom up from its deep slumber, allowing it to take its rightful place on the global stage. By selling a stake in the state oil producer Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, he would begin to wean his economy off its dependency on oil. He would invest billions in Silicon Valley tech startups including the taxi firm, Uber. Then, by giving Saudi women the freedom to join the workforce, he would create six million new jobs. Astonished, Jabri asked the prince about the extent of his ambition. “Have you heard of Alexander the Great?” came the simple reply. MBS ended the conversation there. A midnight meeting that was scheduled to last half-an-hour had gone on for three. Jabri left the room to find several missed calls on his mobile from government colleagues worried about his long disappearance. The Kingdom: The World’s Most Powerful Prince The story of the extraordinary rise to power of the man who runs Saudi Arabia and whose control of oil affects everyone, starting with how he outwitted hundreds of rivals to become crown prince. Watch on BBC iPlayer  For the past year, our documentary team has been talking to both Saudi friends and opponents of MBS, as well as senior Western spies and diplomats. The Saudi government was given the opportunity to respond to the claims made in the BBC’s films and in this article. They chose not to do so. Saad al-Jabri was so high up in the Saudi security apparatus that he was friends with the heads of the CIA and MI6. While the Saudi government has called Jabri a discredited former official, he’s also the most well-informed Saudi dissident to have dared speak about how the crown prince rules Saudi Arabia – and the rare interview he has given us is astonishing in its detail.  By gaining access to many who know the prince personally, we shed new light on the events that have made MBS notorious – including the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the launch of a devastating war in Yemen. With his father increasingly frail, the 38-year-old MBS is now de facto in charge of the birthplace of Islam and the world’s biggest exporter of oil. He’s begun to carry out many of the groundbreaking plans he described to Saad al-Jabri – while also being accused of human rights violations including the suppression of free speech, widespread use of the death penalty and jailing of women's rights activists. The first king of Saudi Arabia fathered at least 42 sons, including MBS’s father, Salman. The crown has traditionally been passed down between these sons. It was  when two of them suddenly died in 2011 and 2012 that Salman was elevated into the line of succession. Western spy agencies make it their business to study the Saudi equivalent of Kremlinology – working out who will be the next king. At this stage, MBS was so young and unknown that he wasn’t even on their radar. “He grew up in relative obscurity,” says Sir John Sawers, chief of MI6 until 2014. “He wasn’t earmarked to rise to power.” The crown prince also grew up in a palace in which bad behaviour had few, if any, consequences; and that may help explain his notorious habit of not thinking through the impact of his decisions until he had already made them. MBS first achieved notoriety in Riyadh in his late teens, when he was nicknamed “Abu Rasasa” or “Father of the Bullet”, after allegedly sending a bullet in the post to a judge who had overruled him in a property dispute. “He has had a certain ruthlessness,” observes Sir John Sawers. “He doesn’t like to be crossed. But that also means he’s been able to drive through changes that no other Saudi leader has been able to do.” Among the most welcome changes, the former MI6 chief says, has been cutting off Saudi funding to overseas mosques and religious schools that became breeding grounds for Islamist jihadism – at huge benefit to the safety of the West. MBS’s mother, Fahda, is a Bedouin tribeswoman and seen as the favourite of his father’s four wives. Western diplomats believe the king has suffered for many years from a slow-onset form of vascular dementia; and MBS was the son he turned to for help. Several diplomats recalled for us their meetings with MBS and his father. The prince would write notes on an iPad, then send them to his father’s iPad, as a way of prompting what he would say next.  The prince was apparently so impatient for his father to become king that in 2014, he reportedly suggested killing the then-monarch – Abdullah, his uncle – with a poisoned ring, obtained from Russia. “I don’t know for sure if he was just bragging, but we took it seriously,” says Jabri. The former senior security official says he has seen a secretly recorded surveillance video of MBS talking about the idea. “He was banned from court, from shaking hands with the king, for a considerable amount of time.” In the event, the king died of natural causes, allowing his brother, Salman, to assume the throne in 2015. MBS was appointed Defence Minister and lost no time in going to war. Two months later, the prince led a Gulf coalition into war against the Houthi movement, which had seized control of much of western Yemen and which he saw as a proxy of Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran. It triggered a humanitarian disaster, with millions on the brink of famine. “It wasn’t a clever decision,” says Sir John Jenkins, who was British ambassador just before the war began. “One senior American military commander told me they had been given 12 hours’ notice of the campaign, which is unheard of.” The military campaign helped turn a little-known prince into a Saudi national hero. However, it was also the first of what even his friends believe have been several major mistakes. A recurring pattern of behaviour was emerging: MBS’s tendency to jettison the traditionally slow and collegiate system of Saudi decision-making, preferring to act unpredictably or upon impulse; and refusing to kowtow to the US, or be treated as head of a backward client state. Jabri goes much further, accusing MBS of forging his father the king’s signature on a royal decree committing ground troops. Jabri says he discussed the Yemen war in the White House before it started; and that Susan Rice, President Obama’s National Security Advisor, warned him that the US would only support an air campaign. However, Jabri claims MBS was so determined to press ahead in Yemen that he ignored the Americans. “We were surprised that there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions,” Jabri says. “He forged the signature of his dad for that royal decree. The king’s mental capacity was deteriorating.” Jabri says his source for this allegation was “credible, reliable” and linked to the Ministry of Interior where he was chief of staff. Jabri recalls the CIA station chief in Riyadh telling him how angry he was that MBS had ignored the Americans, adding that the invasion of Yemen should never have happened. The former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers says that while he doesn’t know if MBS forged the documents, “it is clear that this was MBS’s decision to intervene militarily in Yemen. It wasn’t his father’s decision, although his father was carried along with it.” We’ve discovered that MBS saw himself as an outsider from the very beginning - a young man with much to prove and a refusal to obey anybody’s rules other than his own. Kirsten Fontenrose, who served on President Donald Trump’s National Security Council, says that when she read the CIA’s in-house psychological profile of the prince, she felt it missed the point. “There were no prototypes to base him on,” she says. “He has had unlimited resources. He has never been told ‘no’. He is the first young leader to reflect a generation that, frankly, most of us in government are too old to understand.” MBS’s purchase of a famous painting in 2017 tells us much about how he thinks, and his willingness to be a risk-taker, unafraid to be out of step with the religiously conservative society that he governs. And above all, determined to outplay the West in conspicuous displays of power. In 2017, a Saudi prince reportedly acting for MBS spent $450m (£350m) on the Salvator Mundi, which remains the world’s most expensive work of art ever sold. The portrait, reputed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci, depicts Jesus Christ as master of heaven and Earth, the saviour of the world. For almost seven years, ever since the auction, it has completely disappeared. Bernard Haykel, who speaks regularly to the crown prince and is a Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, says that despite rumours that it hangs in the prince's yacht or palace, the painting is actually in storage in Geneva and that MBS intends to hang it in a museum in the Saudi capital that has not yet been built.  “I want to build a very large museum in Riyadh,” Haykel quotes MBS as saying. “And I want an anchor object that will attract people, just like the Mona Lisa does.” Similarly, his plans for sport reflect someone who is both hugely ambitious and unafraid to disrupt the status quo. Saudi Arabia’s incredible spending spree on world-class sport – it is the sole bidder to host the FIFA World Cup in 2034, and has made multimillion-dollar investments in staging tournaments for tennis and golf – has been called “sportswashing”. But what we found is a leader who cares less about what the West thinks of him than he does about demonstrating the opposite: that he will do whatever he wants in the name of making himself and Saudi Arabia great. “MBS is interested in building his own power as a leader,” says Sir John Sawers, the former Chief of MI6, who has met him. “And the only way he can do that is by building his country’s power. That’s what’s driving him.” Jabri’s 40-year career as a Saudi official did not survive MBS’s consolidation of power. Chief of staff for the former Crown Prince Muhammed bin Nayef, he fled the kingdom as MBS was taking over, after being tipped off by a foreign intelligence service that he could be in danger. But Jabri says MBS texted him out of the blue, offering him his old job back. “It was bait – and I didn’t bite,” Jabri says, convinced he would have been tortured, imprisoned or killed if he returned. As it was, his teenage children, Omar and Sarah, were detained and later jailed for money laundering and for trying to escape – charges that they deny. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for their release. “He planned for my assassination,” Jabri says. “He will not rest until he sees me dead, I have no doubt about that.” Saudi officials have issued Interpol notices for Jabri’s extradition from Canada, without success. They claim he is wanted for corruption involving billions of dollars during his time at the interior ministry. However, he was given the rank of major-general and credited by the CIA and MI6 with helping to prevent al-Qaeda terrorist attacks. The killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 implicates MBS in ways that are very hard to refute. The 15-strong hit squad was travelling on diplomatic passports and included several of MBS’s own bodyguards. Khashoggi’s body has never been found and is believed to have been hacked into pieces with a bone saw. Professor Haykel exchanged WhatsApp messages with MBS not long after the murder. “I was asking, ‘how could this happen?’,” Haykel recalls. “I think he was in deep shock. He didn’t realise the reaction to this was going to be as deep.” The veteran US diplomat Dennis Ross met MBS shortly afterwards. “He said he didn’t do it and that it was a colossal blunder,” says Ross. “I certainly wanted to believe him, because I couldn’t believe that he could authorise something [like] that.” MBS has always denied knowledge of the plot, although in 2019 he said he took “responsibility"" because the crime happened on his watch. A declassified US intelligence report released in February 2021 asserted that he was complicit in the killing of Khashoggi. I asked those who know MBS personally whether he had learned from his mistakes; or whether having survived the Khashoggi affair, it had in fact emboldened him. “He’s learned lessons the hard way,” says Professor Haykel, who says MBS resents the case being used as cudgel against him and his country, but that a killing like Khashoggi’s would not happen again. Sir John Sawers cautiously agrees that the murder was a turning point. “I think he has learned some lessons. The personality, though, remains the same.” His father, King Salman, is now aged 88. When he dies, MBS could rule Saudi Arabia for the next 50 years. However, he has recently admitted he fears being assassinated, possibly as a consequence of his attempts to normalise Saudi-Israeli ties. “I think there are lots of people who want to kill him,” says Professor Haykel, “and he knows it.” Eternal vigilance is what keeps a man like MBS safe. It was what Saad al-Jabri observed at the beginning of the prince’s rise to power, when he pulled the telephone socket out of the wall before speaking to him in his palace. MBS is still a man on a mission to modernise his country, in ways his predecessors would never have dared. But he’s also not the first autocrat who runs the risk of being so ruthless that nobody around him dares prevent him from making more mistakes.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd074r6gxpo,Council pulls funds from firms linked to arms trade,"Waltham Forest Council says the decision to divest its pension funds is in line with its ""beliefs"".",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:06.358734,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A London council has said it will withdraw its pension investments in firms linked to arms producers. Labour-run Waltham Forest Council says £773,000 of its £1.1bn pension fund ""appears to be invested in companies that may derive some element of income from arms"". It says the decision is in line with its ""beliefs"" and it has updated its ""ethical investment policy"". Local campaign group Waltham Forest for a Free Palestine (WF4FP) has been calling for the council to take the action, known as ""divesting"", because of of Israel’s ongoing offensive in Gaza. Israel says it is defending itself, following the deadly attacks last October by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is proscribed by the UK government and others as a terrorist organisation. The decision was taken by the council's pensions committee, whose members act as trustees and have the job of deciding how the fund should be invested in the best interests of the scheme's members. The BBC understands the move is to include cutting financial ties with firms involved in supplying arms not only to Israel, but to any country. Its chair, councillor Johar Khan, said the north-east London authority had taken a responsibility to invest the fund ethically, which it took ""extremely seriously"". ""We work hard to balance this responsibility with the important task of ensuring the fund performs well and continues to support the people who rely on it,"" Mr Khan said.  The local authority told the BBC the decision to divest was subject to a ""robust definition"" of the term ""arms trade"", but this definition may become ""better refined as the sources of information become more comprehensive"". It said while a small portion of its pension fund was held in firms involved with producing arms in some way, the fund had ""zero investment"" in companies that had arms identified as their main source of income.  Mr Khan said: ""This is a complex task that will take some time, and we will keep the community and the pension fund recipients informed as we progress."" Waltham Forest said it would also encourage other councils in the capital to divest in this way, which would be done through the London Collective Investment Vehicle (LCIV), which manages pooled pension funds on councils' behalf. The decision was announced at a special meeting of the council's pensions committee, attended by members of WF4FP. They were invited to present a petition calling for the council to divest from firms the group believed were ""complicit"" in arms dealing. A spokesperson for WF4FP said the group was ""extremely pleased"" with the decision and hoped it would set a precedent with other London boroughs. Although Israel is a major weapons exporter, its military has been heavily reliant on imported aircraft, guided bombs and missiles for its campaign in Gaza.  Waltham Forest's decision follows calls on the UK government to halt weapons exports to Israel. The government says it is ""reviewing the advice"" on exports to Israel and ""no decision has been made"". The campaign group We Believe in Israel is calling for any such plans to be scrapped. Its executive director Catherine Perez-Shakdam said: ""Israel has an unequivocal right to self-defence, particularly in the face of threats from terror groups that the UK itself has proscribed. ""We fully acknowledge the concerns about civilian safety (in Gaza); however, the responsibility lies with Hamas, which continues to incite violence and endanger innocent lives.""  Many public bodies and private companies hold pension funds in firms that some consider to be unethical in some way. These include tobacco, gambling and alcohol firms, as well as arms.  Justin Wray, of the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, said: “Pension schemes have a significant interest in ensuring that the companies they invest in operate to high standards. Funds of all types will typically apply screening along environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles relevant to the types of investment strategy they offer."" “Where they are not happy with the actions of the company they may take the decision to divest,” he explained. However, he added that, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there had been ""renewed debate about the ethics of investing in arms manufacturers"". In April, the former Conservative government issued a joint statement with the Investment Authority, which said: ""Investing in defence companies contributes to our national security, defends the civil liberties we all enjoy, while delivering long-term returns for pensions funds and retail investors. ""Investing in good, high-quality, well-run defence companies is compatible with ESG considerations as long-term sustainable investment is about helping all sectors and all companies in the economy succeed."" Waltham Forest's decision has also been welcomed by national campaign group the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which believes many other local authorities have pension investments in firms linked to the arms trade. Its director Ben Jamal said the decision was a ""huge breakthrough"" in its campaign. ""We thank the councillors of Waltham Forest for standing on the right side of history,"" he said. ""We look forward to them putting this policy into action as soon as possible, and hope other councils around the country will quickly follow suit.” The PSC has previously reported 52 of the 86 Local Government Pension Scheme funds across England and Wales had investments totalling £1.1bn in firms supplying weapons or systems to Israel. This was based on data supplied under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, in 2021.  Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgj2nw4lgro,UK military on standby for possible Lebanon evacuation,Preparations are being made after the government warned the situation in the Middle East could deteriorate.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:06.630677,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"More than a thousand British military personnel have been put on standby in case British nationals need to be evacuated from Lebanon. Preparations are being made in response to a Foreign Office warning that the situation in the Middle East could rapidly deteriorate. On Saturday, the Foreign Office repeated a call for UK nationals to leave Lebanon – while confirming that preparations were underway to help with an evacuation of the country if necessary. An estimated 16,000 British people are currently in Lebanon, Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the House of Commons last week. Hundreds of troops have been sent to Cyprus, where the UK already has a military presence. Meanwhile, in the UK, hundreds more troops have been put on notice - meaning they are ready to be deployed to the region if necessary. The UK already has a significant military presence in Cyprus. An RAF base at Akrotiri is likely to be a hub for any air movements, with RAF Typhoon fighter jets already stationed there. Those jets were involved in defence against an Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel in April. The statement released by the Foreign Office at the weekend said military personnel were in the process of deploying to provide operational support to UK embassies in the region. It did not mention the number of troops involved. A Royal Navy destroyer – HMS Duncan – and a landing ship – RFA Cardigan Bay – are already in the Eastern Mediterranean. RAF helicopters have also been placed on standby. Tensions have been growing across the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in the attack, triggering a massive Israeli military response in Gaza. At least 39,480 Palestinians have been killed since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.  Hostilities between Israel and its neighbours have escalated following the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last Wednesday - an attack Iran has blamed on Israel. Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. In response, Iran has vowed ""severe"" retaliation against Israel. Western officials fear that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement based in Lebanon, could play a key role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response. The US, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and Jordan are among the countries to have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Last year, the British government helped co-ordinate the evacuation of British nationals from Gaza, with some 200 UK citizens thought to be living in the territory before the war broke out. In 2021, over 15,000 people were evacuated from Afghanistan to the UK after the country fell to the Taliban. "

Protesters claim the camp, by King's College, was started over concerns about Cambridge University's investments in relation to the defence and arms industry. In a statement, the university said it was committed to reviewing ""our approach to responsible investment"". Alex Fox, one of the demonstrators, said ""the action we've taken has had clear results."" ""The last hundred days have been completely transformative for me,"" the former student added. ""The sense we are building community and resistance is hugely important.  ""The whole city of Cambridge is joining us as we fight for Palestinian lives. The action we've taken has had clear results."" He added: ""We have shown that we are stronger than an 800-year-old institution whose bureaucracy stalls everything. We won't go away until Palestine is free."" Mahmoud Atallah, a spokesman for protesters at the camp, said: ""The time to disband is now [because we need] to reorganise.  ""We achieved much more than our initial demands. We wanted disclosure, divestment, reinvestment and protection. At least three of those are in the process of being done."" Mr Atallah, a 23-year-old Cambridge University student who grew up in Egypt, said investment had been put in place for scholarships for Palestinian students. ""The bigger win is building this community,"" he added. In a statement published on 1 August, the university said: ""We are aware that the students who have been participating in the protests are seeking firm commitments and a clear roadmap. ""We will ensure that the review processes relating to responsible investments and research relationships outlined in this document take place rapidly during Michaelmas Term 2024 [8 October - 6 December], with the aim of arriving at initial positions by the end of the term.  ""The University will also keep the community updated on progress throughout.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd3g1vw79o,Gaza to get 1.2m polio vaccines amid outbreak fears,"The agency's chief called for a ceasefire and ""total freedom of movement"" so the vaccine programme can be rolled out.",7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.114160,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced plans to send 1.2 million polio vaccines to Gaza after the virus was detected in wastewater. The agency’s chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outlined plans for two rounds of vaccination, targeting 600,000 children under the age of eight. The first round is due to start on 17 August. Polio is a serious infectious disease that causes a fever - and, in some cases, can lead to paralysis or death. It is spread primarily through contact with faecal matter.  Gaza remains the focus of a 10-month-long Israeli military operation which has left only 16 out of 36 of the territory's hospitals even partially functional. It will be a “huge logistical challenge” to ensure the 1.2 million vaccine doses are deployed successfully, said WHO official Andrea King. Vaccines need to be continuously stored in a limited temperature range – from the moment they are manufactured until they are administered - which presents a technical challenge during ongoing hostilities. The WHO called for a ceasefire and requested “absolute freedom of movement” during the rollout of the vaccine programme. It said it was in the process of obtaining the necessary approvals to enter Gaza. However, previous calls for a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds have not been granted by Israel. The Israeli military said in July it had begun vaccinating its soldiers against the disease. Testing run by WHO last month showed that sewage samples collected in two areas of Gaza were positive for polio. The genetic nature of the samples indicated they had been circulating in Gaza “for some time, maybe as early as since September of last year”, WHO polio specialist Dr Hamed Jafari said in July. He added that Gaza offered “ideal conditions” for polio transmission, because of “displacement, overcrowding, sewage contamination, lack of clean water”. The WHO says immunisation rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank were optimal before the conflict. Polio vaccine coverage was estimated at 99% in 2022, although it had declined to 89% last year, according to the latest data. Last week, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said the territory had become a ""polio epidemic zone"". It blamed the reappearance of the virus on Israel's military offensive and the resulting destruction of health facilities. The WHO says that fewer than half of Gaza's primary healthcare facilities are operational. As many as 70% of sewage pumps in Gaza have been destroyed and not a single wastewater treatment plant is working, the agency said, presenting the ""perfect breeding ground"" for disease to spread. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the  territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not distinguish between civilian and militant deaths. Israel's offensive began in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynlxr2lx6o,Western envoys shun Nagasaki event over Israel snub,"The Japanese city's mayor says the decision to exclude Israel was not political, but will not change.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.206367,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Ambassadors from Western countries including the United States and the United Kingdom will not attend a ceremony marking the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki after Israel was snubbed.  The mayor of the south-western Japanese city, Shiro Suzuki, said on Thursday that Israel not being invited to attend was not politically motivated but added there would be no change to the decision.  The remarks come a day after it was revealed that the ambassadors of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the US and the European Union had sent a letter to Nagasaki in mid-July saying ""it would become difficult for us to have high-level participation"" in the event if Israel was excluded.  The bomb dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 is thought to have killed about 74,000 people, both from the explosion itself and later from radiation. It came three days after the first bomb dropped on Hiroshima and six days before Japan's surrender in World War II. Mr Suzuki said security reasons, including potential demonstrations, were behind his decision not to invite Israel to the commemoration ceremony.  But he said he regretted the ambassadors' decision. ""It is unfortunate that they have communicated to us that their ambassadors are not able to attend,"" he said. A spokesperson for the British embassy in Tokyo confirmed to the BBC that ambassador Julia Longbottom would not attend the ceremony in Nagasaki.  Ambassador Longbottom had said that the decision not to invite Israel created an unfortunate and misleading equivalency with Russia and Belarus - the only other countries not invited to this year's ceremony.  US Ambassador Rahm Emanuel will also not attend. An embassy statement said the mayor of Nagasaki politicised the event by snubbing Israel. A spokesperson told the BBC the ambassador would instead go to a peace ceremony at a temple in Tokyo. Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, who was invited to and attended a memorial ceremony in Hiroshima on Tuesday, said Nagasaki’s decision ""sends a wrong message to the world"". In June, Mr Suzuki said Nagasaki had sent a letter to the Israeli embassy calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza. Almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's massive military offensive in Gaza, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. It was triggered by  the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages. "

The Israeli military says it carried out two separate air strikes in the north of the territory targeting members of armed groups.   There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October. The local health ministry says at least 600 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - have been killed in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.  At least 17 Israelis, including 12 security forces personnel, have also been killed in the West Bank, according to a UN tally. Palestinian Authority spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeinah condemned the recent violence, as well as alleged torture and abuse of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as the ""crossing of all red lines"". Footage from Aqaba, near Tubas, shows a house stained with blood. Locals say that a boy of 14 was among four killed after a dawn raid by Israeli forces resulted in violent confrontations.   Meanwhile, in Jenin - a regular flashpoint - an Israeli aircraft attacked what the Israeli military described as “terrorist cells” killing at least five.   A column of Israeli armoured personnel carriers was filmed entering the city, while armoured bulldozers dug up roads.   Tensions remain very high across the West Bank. In the south of the territory, a Palestinian was killed after allegedly stabbing an Israeli soldier in Beit Jala, at a main checkpoint on a road to Jerusalem."

Speaking in a televised speech to mark one week since Fuad Shukr’s killing, Hassan Nasrallah said the retaliation would be “strong” and “effective”, and that the assassination could not be treated as an ordinary attack. He added that the group might act alone or in co-ordination with other Iranian-supported factions in the region. Countries around the world have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon in recent days, amid concerns that a possible attack from the heavily armed Hezbollah on Israel could lead to a wider war between the two sides. Iran has also vowed to retaliate following the assassination of the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last week. Both Hamas and Iran blame Israel, which has not commented. On Tuesday afternoon, low-flying Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier above Beirut, in the minutes before Nasrallah was due to begin his speech. Nasrallah, who spoke for more than an hour and a half, said that the sonic booms were intended to provoke those who had gathered to listen to him.  Earlier on Tuesday, Israel said it had carried out an air strike against what it said was a ""military structure"" used by Hezbollah, the militia and political movement, in southern Lebanon. Four people were killed in the strike on a house in the town of Maifadoun, around 19 miles (30km) from the Israeli border, the Lebanese health ministry said. The four men were Hezbollah fighters, security sources told the AFP news agency. In an apparent response, the group launched drone strikes on towns in northern Israel, injuring two people. Several countries, including the US, have urged citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. The country's foreign minister said on Tuesday that he was working to ensure that Hezbollah did not trigger a major escalation with its response to Shukr's death. The Israeli attack on Maifadoun was carried out by fighter jets, and was guided by intelligence agencies, the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement posted to social media. Officers from the internal security agency Shin Bet and military intelligence agency Aman provided assistance to the military. In response, Hezbollah fired what it called a ""swarm"" of drones at Israel, injuring two people in the northern town of Mazra’a. But a source in the group told the Reuters news agency that the attack was not part of its response to the death of Shukr. US President Joe Biden met his senior national security team on Monday as concerns of a retaliatory attack on Israel grew. Mr Biden said he had been briefed on preparations to support Israel, should it be attacked, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said officials were working ""around the clock"" to prevent an escalation. The United Nations' rights chief Volker Turk called on ""all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation"". Elsewhere,  several US military personnel have been injured  in a strike on a base in Iraq. The rocket fire on the Ain al-Assed base is the latest in a series of attacks on the facility, which hosts American forces fighting the Islamic State group."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxjjvdq7eyo,Hamas names Yahya Sinwar as new overall leader,"Hamas has named Yahya Sinwar as its new political chief, replacing Ismail Haniyeh who was killed last week.",7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.529924,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"After two days of lengthy negotiations in Doha, Hamas has named Yahya Sinwar as its new overall chief, replacing Ismail Haniyeh who was assassinated in Tehran last week. Since 2017, Sinwar has served as the group's leader inside the Gaza strip. He will now become leader of its political wing. The Hamas leadership unanimously chose Sinwar to lead the movement, a senior Hamas official told the BBC. The announcement comes at a moment of soaring tensions in the Middle East, as Iran and its allies threaten retaliation for the killing of Haniyeh, which they blame on Israel. Israel has not commented. Over the course of two days in Doha, intensive meetings involving Hamas’s leading figures hammered out the options for the group's next chief. Many scenarios were discussed, but ultimately, just two names were put forward: Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Hassan Darwish, a shadowy figure who heads the General Shura Council, a body that elects Hamas's Politburo. The council voted unanimously to choose Sinwar, in what one Hamas official described to the BBC as “a message of defiance to Israel”. “They killed Haniyeh, the flexible person who was open to solutions. Now they have to deal with Sinwar and the military leadership,” the official said. Prior to his death, Ismail Haniyeh was viewed by regional diplomats as a pragmatic figure compared to others in Hamas - a key driver of the group’s political outreach. Yahya Sinwar, on the other hand, is viewed as one of Hamas’s most extreme figures. Sinwar currently tops Israel’s most-wanted list. Israel's security agencies believe he masterminded the planning and execution of the 7 October 2023 attacks, which left over 1,200 people dead and 251 taken back into Gaza as hostages. ""The appointment of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, is yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organisation off the face of the Earth,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on X. “Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist, who is responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack in history,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari told Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya.  Sinwar has not been seen in public since the attacks in October, and is believed to be hiding “10 storeys underground” in Gaza, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in June. Javed Ali, a former US National Security Council official, told the BBC that Sinwar's appointment could further hinder ceasefire and hostage release talks as he is ""much more inflexible and much more difficult to negotiate with"". Sinwar was born in Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza in 1962. In the late 1980s, Sinwar founded the Hamas security service known as Majd, which among other things targeted alleged Palestinian collaborators with Israel. He has spent much of his life in Israeli jail - and after his third arrest in 1988 he was sentenced to four life terms in prison. However, he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in the 2011 exchange for Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive for over five years by Hamas. The 61-year-old was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017, a position he served in until now. The US includes Sinwar on its blacklist of ""international terrorists""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewlle7jrgdo,'Squad' member Cori Bush loses congressional primary,Ms Bush was unseated in Missouri's first congressional district by St Louis prosecutor Wesley Bell.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.631590,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Democratic congresswoman and ""Squad"" member Cori Bush has lost her primary race in Missouri, according to US media projections.  Wesley Bell, a St Louis prosecutor, will instead be the party's candidate in the state's first congressional district this November.  Ms Bush, a nurse, came to prominence as an organiser in the Black Lives Matter movement and, after taking office in 2021, as one of the Democratic members of the ""Squad"", who are known to support progressive causes.  She has been a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza, with pro-Israel groups spending more than $10m (£7.9m) on efforts to unseat her in the primary. Projections from both the Associated Press news agency and NBC News suggest Mr Bell is on track to win the vote with 51% of ballots cast, compared to Ms Bush's 46%.  The district is a strongly Democratic area and Mr Bell is expected to hold it in the November general election.  Almost all the money spent in campaigning against Ms Bush reportedly came from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Aipac is a pro-Israel lobbying group and has vowed to spend over $100m to unseat progressive lawmakers who have spoken out against the war in Gaza, Politico reported. In her concession speech, Ms Bush declared: ""All they did was radicalise me, so now they need to be afraid."" ""Aipac, I'm coming to tear your kingdom down,"" she added.  It marks the second loss for the Squad - a group of nine progressive Democrats in the US House of Representatives - during the 2024 election cycle.  In June, more than $15m was put into a successful bid to oust Jamaal Bowman, another critic of Israel, from his seat in New York. The figure was the most spent in any House primary in history. Mr Bowman was ousted just weeks after he was censured for pulling a fire alarm while the House was in session. Speaking to CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, ahead of the vote, Mr Bell accused Ms Bush of ""not doing her job"".  ""She is not working with others, and it's hurting our district."" Ms Bush defended her record to the outlet: ""My community knows who I am. They know that I am going to fight for the people in the streets."" Less than two weeks after the 7 October attacks, Ms Bush introduced a resolution calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid. The attacks, carried out by Hamas and other armed militant groups saw around 1,200 people killed in Israel and another 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. In response, Israel declared a ""complete siege"" on Gaza, cutting off supplies of electricity, food, fuel, and water. To date, more than 39,600 people have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Bush also boycotted a joint address to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July, calling him a war criminal and saying he was at the forefront of a genocide. Dozens of House and Senate Democrats boycotted Mr Netanyahu's address.  In a statement ahead of the vote Ms Bush accused Mr Netanyahu of perpetrating a ""genocide"" in Gaza and claimed Congress was ""actively celebrating"" his actions.  Ms Bush has also been investigated by the justice department, House ethics committee and Federal Elections Commission for her campaign spending, mostly over allegations that she improperly paid her husband, a security guard, for protection. She previously said any claims she had misused federal funds were ""simply false"". Three other US states - Kansas, Michigan and Washington - also held primary elections on Tuesday. Dan Newhouse, one of the last remaining Republicans to have voted to impeach Donald Trump, appeared to have scraped through in his primary election. Washington state holds what is known as a jungle primary, allowing the top two finishers - regardless of party - to advance to the general election. Mr Newhouse, an agricultural scientist who has represented a central Washington district since 2015, faced off against two Trump-endorsed candidates - Navy veteran Jerrod Sessler and ex-nurse Tiffany Smiley. Early projections of the race show Mr Sessler leading Mr Newhouse, with Ms Smiley close behind them - meaning that the incumbent could face a difficult challenge in November.  Of the so-called ""Impeachment 10"" - Republicans who voted in favour of Trump's impeachment - only Mr Newhouse and California's David Valadao remain in the House.  All other pro-impeachment Republicans have either left Congress since their 2021 vote or been defeated in primary races."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqr48zld2o,"Long-doubted by Democrats, Kamala Harris faces her biggest political moment",She has generated huge voter enthusiasm since becoming the party’s presidential candidate - and it reflects years of deliberate preparation for a role many thought she wasn’t cut out for.,18 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.747843,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"When Kamala Harris steps onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week as the party’s presidential nominee, she’ll do so knowing that many in the audience cheering her on once counted her out. Ms Harris, 59, has faced years of doubt from some within her party about her ability to run for America’s highest political office - including from President Joe Biden, the man whom she continues to serve as vice-president. Since replacing Mr Biden as Democratic nominee in mid-July, Ms Harris has seen a tidal wave of enthusiasm for her candidacy - reflected in polling, fundraising and the enormous crowds that have come out to see her at rallies across the country. But the political momentum and energy she has generated in recent weeks among Democrats was never a given. After failing in a short-lived presidential bid in 2019, she began her vice-presidency on a shaky footing, beset by stumbles in high-profile interviews, staff turnover and low approval ratings. And for the last three-and-a-half years in the White House she has struggled to break through to American voters. Advisers and allies say that in the years since those early struggles she has sharpened her political skills, created loyal coalitions within her party and built credibility on issues like abortion rights that energise the Democratic base. She has, in other words, been preparing for a moment exactly like this one. On Thursday, as she formally accepts the Democratic nomination, Ms Harris has an opportunity to reintroduce herself on the national stage with fewer than 80 days until an election that could see her become the nation’s first female president. At the same time, she’ll have to prove that she is capable of leading a party that never saw her as its natural leader and remains divided over the war in Israel and Gaza. But above all, she’ll need put to rest any lingering doubt among the Democratic faithful that she can meet the challenge of defeating former president Donald Trump in what remains a tight and unpredictable contest. Before Kamala Harris became a national figure, the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general had forged a reputation as a rising star in the party, landing the endorsement of President Barack Obama in her 2010 race to become the state’s top lawyer. But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state’s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. “Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden’s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling. She attacked Mr Biden for an earlier campaign moment in which he fondly recalled working with two segregationist senators, before accusing him of opposing the bussing of students between schools to help integrate them. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Ms Harris said. “And that little girl was me.” But campaign infighting and indecision on which issues to emphasise ultimately sank her presidential bid. The campaign was marked by “a lot of rookie mistakes”, said Kevin Madden, an adviser on Republican Mitt Romney’s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. “The substance that needed to be there to pass the commander-in-chief test and to really fill in some of the blanks for voters, it just wasn’t there and as a result her opponents filled it in for her.” Eight months later, Mr Biden put aside their primary rivalry and announced Ms Harris as his running mate. She became the first woman of colour to ever be nominated in that position - and in January 2021, the first female vice-president in US history. It was five months into her job as Mr Biden’s vice-president that Ms Harris endured her first public stumble during a foreign trip to Guatemala and Mexico. The trip was meant to showcase her role in pursuing economic initiatives to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the US southern border, a foreign policy assignment given to her by Mr Biden. But it was quickly overshadowed by an awkward exchange in an interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, in which she dismissed repeated questions about why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border. Later that day, during a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Ms Harris tried to recapture the narrative, delivering a stark message to migrants thinking of making their way to the US. “Do not come,” she told them. “Do not come.” While the NBC News interview fuelled Republican attacks that continue to this day, the latter comments drew the ire of progressives and were quickly panned on social media, even though other administration officials had echoed the same rhetoric. The vice-president’s allies blamed the White House for failing to adequately prepare her and assigning an unwinnable issue. They complained that as the first woman, African-American and Asian-American to serve as vice-president, outsized expectations had been imposed on her from the very start of her term, giving her little time to settle. “There was immense pressure in the beginning to own things,” said one former aide who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their time in the White House. In the months that followed, Ms Harris endured more scrutiny as she faced high staff turnover, a slew of negative headlines about her performance and underwhelming media appearances. Hemmed in by Covid restrictions, she was limited in her public engagements, fuelling the perception that she was invisible. When critics labelled her a prop for standing behind Mr Biden at bill-signing ceremonies – as her white male predecessors in the role regularly did – a decision was made to remove her from those events altogether, according to aides, triggering more criticism that she was absent. “People had an expectation to experience her as vice-president as if she was Michelle Obama, but she was in a job… built for Al Gore or Mike Pence,” said Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist who was brought in as her communications director during the second year. As her team sought to improve her poor public image, Ms Harris stepped into a bigger foreign policy role. She travelled to Poland in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, held bilateral meetings in Asia amid heightened tensions with China and stood in for Mr Biden at the Munich Security Conference that same year. But in May 2022, a political earthquake would reshape the trajectory of her vice-presidency. In a rare breach of the Supreme Court, a leaked draft opinion revealed plans to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade abortion ruling - which had protected American women’s federal right to abortion for nearly half a century. She seized on the opportunity to be the lead messenger on an issue that Mr Biden – a devout Irish Catholic who avoided even saying the term “abortion” – was reluctant to own. “How dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body?” she told the crowd at an event for a pro-choice group on the same day the bombshell leak was published, deciding to attack the nation’s top judges before their decision was officially released. The issue proved to be a driving force for voters in the midterm elections a few months later, helping Democrats to perform better than expected in congressional races and to hold the Senate. In seeking to become the administration’s leading voice on abortion, Ms Harris tackled the issue with “clarity of purpose”, said former longtime adviser Rachel Palermo. She convened state legislators, faith leaders, constitutional law experts, healthcare providers and advocates for roundtable discussions. It was a move panned by some activists as not meeting the seriousness of the moment but it was part of a strategy of coalition-building across local and state politics that also helped lay the groundwork for any future presidential run. Ms Harris, who spent most of her career navigating California’s tricky mix of liberal and traditional Democratic politics, knew every event mattered. Every meeting, photo opportunity or dinner - whether it was with black business leaders or Hispanic female CEOs – was tracked by her team in detailed spreadsheets that she could utilise when the time came to call on a deep political network for support. “She forced the operation to mobilise around how she views politics, which is coalitions,” a senior official said. Ms Harris always had her eye on a 2028 bid for the White House, as Joe Biden’s natural successor, assuming he won a second term in the 2024 contest. Yet as rumblings mounted about replacing Mr Biden on the ticket after his stumbling debate performance in late June against Donald Trump, some Democrats openly overlooked her. They, and many pundits, suggested popular governors like California’s Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro or Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer as better replacements who could motivate voters and take the fight to Trump. On 21 July, Mr Biden phoned Ms Harris to tell her of his plans to drop out of the race and endorse her as his successor. It was a decision that took many of his closest allies by surprise, but she sprang into action. Over the course of 10 hours that Sunday, she called more than 100 party officials, members of Congress, labour leaders and activists. Within days, any potential rivals, including the powerful governors, had fallen into line and it was clear that she would take the Democratic mantle with no serious challenge. As a candidate, the vice-president has yet to lay out a detailed policy agenda or sit down for a tough media interview. She released an economic blueprint on Friday, calling for tax cuts for families and a wider push on capping drug pricing, her most detailed vision for the country so far. Even as Republicans  accuse her of avoiding scrutiny, the team around her see no rush in cutting off the momentum she’s built over the last month. Political strategists say the campaign is right to capitalise on the “sugar high”. “What Kamala Harris is experiencing is a massive, pent-up demand for people to vote for anybody not named Biden or Trump,” said Mr Madden, the former Romney aide and Republican communications strategist. “But the test always comes with being exposed to interviews, the press, debates and the harsh glare of a campaign.” Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who helped organise a meeting of historians at Ms Harris’s official residence last year, said the fact that she has been a blank slate for voters is more of a benefit than a burden. “She may not have been able to be in full bloom under Biden but she never crossed wires with him,” he said. “So she was able to be positioned for this moment and she can take what’s good about the Biden years and shed the baggage of what she wants to, or slightly disagrees with.” Though her entrance has jolted an outpouring of support among Democrats, it’s unclear whether she can translate that into broad appeal. While Ms Harris has made some inroads with key demographic groups that had drifted from Mr Biden – black, Latino and young voters in particular – she lags in other constituencies that made up his winning 2020 coalition. Recent polling puts her ahead or tied with Trump in six of the seven battleground states, according to a Cook Political Report survey released on Wednesday. In May, when Mr Biden was still the Democratic candidate, Trump was ahead or tied in all seven states. Thursday night’s speech at the Democratic convention is the most consequential moment in Kamala Harris’s political career. While the Republican convention served as a coronation for Trump, who was nominated as his party’s candidate for the third consecutive time, Ms Harris’s sudden rise means her speech will be seen as a pivotal moment to define who she really is. While she’s stood on the stage before, a senior aide said the speech will have a heavier focus on her personal story than previous nominees. “This is the why part of the conversation. Why is she running for president? What is her vision for the country?” said Mr Simmons, her former communications director. “That will help tie together all of the strands of her policy and political life that will make sense for people.” But over the course of four days, Ms Harris will need to sharpen her messaging around crime, inflation, the economy and immigration – issues the Trump campaign will relentlessly target between now and election day. Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican strategist, said Ms Harris will also at some point have to clarify the left-leaning positions she took in 2019 during her failed presidential bid. ""Her greatest vulnerability is that there is plenty of evidence that she's a San Francisco liberal with a whole set of far left wing policy positions that are outside the mainstream of American thinking, and she hasn't had to answer for those yet,"" he said.  She will also be confronted with protests over Israel’s actions in Gaza, a polarising issue that has politically cleaved the party. Ms Harris has been more forceful in her calls for a ceasefire and condemnation of civilian deaths than President Biden, but she has not wavered from the administration’s steadfast support for Israel - a stance that risks alienating the party’s progressive wing. “How she positions [herself on Gaza] is going to be her hardest trick,” said Mr Brinkley, the presidential historian. Still, allies and advisers who have been preparing her over the last week contend she’s built the foundations for a presidential run over the last four – sometimes bumpy – years, even if few expected she would actually find herself in this position at this moment. “Opportunity is preparation meeting a little bit of luck and I wouldn’t characterise this as luck, because nobody wanted it to be this way, but certainly she was prepared to meet the moment of opportunity,” a senior political adviser said. Susie Tompkins Buell, a Democratic donor and co-founder of Esprit and The North Face who has known Ms Harris since the 1990s, said she wasn’t surprised by how Ms Harris had performed in the last few weeks. In the days after Mr Biden’s halting debate performance, she attended an event with the vice-president and said she could tell change was afoot. After telling Ms Harris to fasten her seatbelt, Ms Buell said the soon-to-be Democratic nominee quipped, “I was born with a seatbelt.” “I liked her response,” said Ms Tompkins Buell, who helped Ms Harris raise $12m at a San Francisco fundraiser earlier this month. “It was sudden and it was right on. She’s ready.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xxeqel5po,Calls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow,"Fears grow that Iran may attack Israel after high-profile assassinations, with Hezbollah in Lebanon joining.",5 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.828791,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Several countries have urged their nationals to leave Lebanon, as fears grow of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Iran has vowed “severe” retaliation against Israel, which it blames for the death of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday. Israel has not commented.  His assassination came hours after Israel killed Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Western officials fear that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement based in Lebanon, could play a key role in any such retaliation, which in turn could spark a serious Israeli response.  Diplomatic efforts by the US and other Western countries continue to try to de-escalate tensions across the region. A growing number of flights have been cancelled or suspended at the country’s only commercial airport in Beirut. The US, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Turkey and Jordan are among the countries to have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Fears of an escalation of hostilities that could engulf Lebanon are at their highest since Hezbollah stepped up its attacks on Israel, a day after the deadly Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in support for Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the violence has been contained to border areas, with both sides indicating not being interested in a wider conflict.  Hezbollah, however, has vowed to respond to Shukr’s assassination, which happened in Dahiyeh, the group’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs. It came after 12 children and teenagers were killed in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. Israel said Shukr was behind it. Meanwhile there has been continuing firing between the two sides. Hezbollah said it launched drones at a military barracks in Ayelet HaShahar, northern Israel, in the early hours of Monday morning. The Israeli military said two soldiers were wounded.  It came a day after Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at the nearby town of Beit Hillel. There were no reports of casualties from that attack. Israel’s air force responded by striking targets in southern Lebanon. A Hezbollah fighter and a paramedic were killed in a strike on the town of Mays al-Jabal, less than a mile from the border with Israel. In a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The attacker, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank, was later “neutralised”, police said. Also on Sunday, officials from the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza said an Israeli air strike had hit a tent inside a hospital, killing at least five people. The officials said 19 Palestinians had been killed across the day.  In a statement on Saturday, the US embassy in Beirut said those who chose to stay in Lebanon should “prepare contingency plans” and be prepared to “shelter in place for an extended period of time”. The Pentagon has said it is deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, a strategy similar to the one adopted in April, when Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria.  It blamed Israel for that strike. Many fear Iran’s retaliation on this occasion could take a similar form. The UK says it is sending extra military personnel, consular staff and border force officials to help with any evacuations. It has urged UK citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial flights are running. Two British military ships are already in the region and the Royal Air Force has put transport helicopters on standby. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the regional situation “could deteriorate rapidly”. In a phone call with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell on Friday, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran would ""undoubtedly use its inherent and legitimate right"" to ""punish"" Israel. On Friday, an announcer on Iran's state TV warned ""the world would witness extraordinary scenes"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Tensions escalated after a rocket strike on a football pitch in the occupied Golan Heights killed 12 children and teenagers.  Israel accused Hezbollah and vowed “severe” retaliation, though Hezbollah denied it was involved. Days later, Shukr, who was a close adviser to the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in a targeted Israeli air strike in Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours after that, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran, Hamas's main backer. He was visiting to attend the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said Israel will suffer a “harsh punishment” for the killing. Haniyeh's assassination dealt a blow to the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, the main hope to defuse tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvyyz8461yo,UN staff fired over possible links to 7 October attack,The sackings follow a UN investigation into their possible involvement in the Hamas-led attack on Israel.,6 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.912560,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Nine staff members at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel, the United Nations says. All nine would have their employment terminated, said UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq. He said the UN had completed an investigation following allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff were involved. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn. Since the attack, the Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed more than 38,400 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  Mr Haq did not specify what the men's precise involvement may have been. ""For us, any participation in the attacks is a tremendous betrayal of the sort of work that we are supposed to be doing on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" he said. An Israeli Defense Forces spokeperson said the report showed UNRWA had hit a ""new low"". The UN investigated 19 members of UNRWA staff in all, after Israel alleged that 12 took part in the attack. Israel later claimed that more than 450 UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups, but a UN review published in April found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims. Aside from the nine employees who the UN said may have had links to the 7 October attack, its report found no evidence of involvement in one case, and insufficient evidence in the case of nine others. UNRWA, which employs 13,000 people in Gaza, said in March that some of its employees reported being pressured by Israeli authorities into making false statements while in detention. Most countries withdrew funding for the UN agency because of the Israeli allegations.  In July, the UK joined other countries that had resumed funding since then, leaving the US, UNRWA's single biggest donor, as the only country not to have restarted donations.  UNRWA has provided aid for Palestinian refugees since 1949."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly99379qjgo,Biden meets national security team as fears of Iran attack on Israel grow,Iran has vowed to respond to the killing of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week.,6 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.071241,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden met his senior national security team on Monday as concerns of a possible Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel grew. Mr Biden said he had been briefed on preparations to support Israel should it be attacked, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken said officials were working ""around the clock"" to prevent an escalation.  Tensions have risen over the last week following the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, for which Iran has blamed Israel and vowed “severe” retaliation. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination. Numerous countries, including the US and UK, have also told their citizens to leave Lebanon, from where it is feared Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia and political movement, could play a role in any response.   During Monday's briefing, Mr Biden was told the timing and nature of an Iranian attack remained unclear, according to US news site Axios. A day earlier, Mr Blinken reportedly told his G7 counterparts that Iran and Hezbollah could attack Israel within 24 to 48 hours. In a statement released after the briefing, Mr Biden said: ""We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again.""  He added that steps were being taken to respond to attacks on US forces ""in a manner and place of our choosing"". On Monday, several US personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Mr Blinken said officials were ""engaged in intense diplomacy pretty much around the clock with a very simple message: All parties must refrain from escalation"".  ""Escalation is not in anyone's interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity,"" he said. He added that a ceasefire would ""unlock possibilities for more enduring calm not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict can spread"".  ""It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Biden spoke to King Abdullah II of Jordan about ""efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal"", a statement from the White House said. A joint statement from the G7 also expressed ""deep concern at the heightened level of tension in the Middle East which threatens to ignite a broader conflict in the region"".  ""No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East,"" it said. Talks that had brought renewed hope of a ceasefire deal to end the conflict in Gaza have faltered following the events of recent weeks.  On 27 July, 12 children and teenagers were killed in a strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel accused Hezbollah of carrying out the strike, though Hezbollah denied any involvement. Days later, Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah military commander, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Four others, including two children, were also killed. Hours later, Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said Haniyeh was killed in a ""strong blast"" caused by a ""short-range projectile"" fired from outside a house where he was staying while visiting the capital, Tehran.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in an interview with Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that the killing would have a ""negative impact on the ongoing negotiations"". Israel has not commented on the assassination, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterwards that Israel had delivered “crushing blows” to Iran’s proxy groups in recent days. Following the killings in Lebanon and Iran, the IRGC said Israel would receive a ""severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner"", while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the conflict had entered a ""new phase"". It is the closest the conflict has come to escalation since April, when Iran fired some 300 drones and missiles at Israel in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria that killed a number of senior military commanders. On Monday, Jordan asked all airlines planning to land at its airports to carry an additional 45 minutes' worth of fuel, a move thought to be a precaution in case Jordan has to close its airspace in the event of a regional conflict.  German flag carrier Lufthansa has suspended all flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran, and Beirut until and including 12 August.  US airline Delta has also paused flights to Tel Aviv until at least 31 August ""due to ongoing conflict in the region"". The UK Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Lebanon and has urged British citizens in the country to leave. It also advises against all travel to the northern area of Israel that shares a border with Lebanon.  The conflict in Gaza began following the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas and other militant groups, which saw around 1,200 people killed and another 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages.  Since the launch of Israel's retaliatory ground invasion in Gaza, more than 39,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hezbollah and Israeli forces have also exchanged near-daily attacks since the conflict began, with hundreds of people killed and thousands displaced on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border.  Hezbollah and Hamas are both backed by Iran and form part of what Iran calls the ""axis of resistance"", a loose alliance of militant and political groups across the region that oppose Israel and its key ally, the US.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yylgze4ro,"Blindfolded, bound and beaten: Palestinians tell of Israeli jail abuse","An Israeli rights group says prisons are overwhelmed, amid allegations of physical and mental violence.",6 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.168676,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Warning: This article contains details which some readers may find upsetting Israel’s leading human rights organisation says conditions inside Israeli prisons holding Palestinian detainees amount to torture. B’tselem’s report entitled “Welcome to Hell”, contains testimony from 55 recently released Palestinian detainees, whose graphic testimony points to a dramatic worsening of conditions inside prisons since the start of the Gaza war 10 months ago. It's the latest in a series of reports, including one last week by the UN, which contain shocking allegations of abuse directed against Palestinian prisoners. B’tselem says the testimony their researchers have gathered is remarkably consistent. “All of them again and again, told us the same thing,” says Yuli Novak, B’tselem’s executive director. “Ongoing abuse, daily violence, physical violence and mental violence, humiliation, sleep deprivation, people are starved.” Ms Novak’s conclusion is stark. “The Israeli prison system as a whole, in regard to Palestinians, turned into a network of torture camps.” Since the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October, in which around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the number of Palestinian detainees has doubled to around 10,000. Israel’s prisons - some run by the army, others by the country’s prison service - have become overwhelmed. Jails are overflowing, with a dozen or more inmates sometimes sharing cells designed to accommodate no more than six. B’tselem’s report describes overcrowded, filthy cells, where some inmates are forced to sleep on the floor, sometimes without mattresses or blankets. Some prisoners were captured in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Others were rounded up in Gaza as Israel’s invasion got under way, or were arrested in Israel or the occupied West Bank. Many were later released without charge. Firas Hassan was already in jail in October, held under “administrative detention”, a measure by which suspects – though it has overwhelmingly been applied to Palestinians - can be detained, more or less indefinitely, without charge. Israel says that its use of the policy is necessary, and compliant with international law. Firas says he saw with his own eyes how conditions quickly deteriorated after 7 October. “Life totally changed,” he told me when we met in Tuqu’, a West Bank village south of Bethlehem. “I call what happened a tsunami.” Mr Hassan has been in and out of jail since the early nineties, twice charged with membership of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel and much of the West. He makes no secret of his past affiliation, saying he was “active”. Familiar with the rigours of life in prison, he said nothing prepared him for what happened when officers entered his cell two days after 7 October. “We were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms,” he said. “We were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face. They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us while beating us.” Mr Hassan was eventually released, without charge, in April, by which time he said he had lost 3 stone (20kg). A video filmed on the day of his release shows a gaunt figure. “I spent 13 years in prison in the past,” he told B’tselem researchers later that month, “and never experienced anything like that.” But it’s not just Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank who talk about the abuse in Israeli prisons. Israeli citizens, like Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer from Haifa, say it has also happened to them. Mr Khourieh was held at the Megiddo prison in northern Israel for 10 days last November. The police said that two of his Facebook posts had glorified the actions of Hamas – a charge quickly dismissed. But his brief experience of prison – his first – nearly broke him. “They just lost their mind,” he says of the scenes he witnessed at Megiddo. “There was no law. There was no order inside.” Mr Khourieh says he was spared the worst of the abuse. But he says he was stunned by the treatment of his fellow inmates. “They were hitting them badly for no reason,” he told us. “They were screaming, the guys, ‘we didn't do nothing. You don't have to hit us.’” Speaking to other detainees, he quickly learned that what he was seeing was not normal. “It wasn’t the best treatment before 7 October, they told me, but afterwards everything was different.” During a brief spell in an area of isolation cells known by the prisoners as Tora Bora (a reference to al-Qaeda’s network of caves in Afghanistan), Mr Khourieh says he heard a beaten inmate pleading for medical help in an adjacent cell. According to Mr Khourieh, doctors tried to revive him, but he died shortly afterwards. According to last week’s UN report, “announcements by IPS (Israel Prison Service) and prisoners organisations indicate that 17 Palestinians have died in the custody of the IPS between 7 October and 15 May”. Israel’s military advocate, meanwhile, said on 26 May that it was investigating the deaths of 35 Gaza detainees in army custody. Several months after Mr Khourieh’s release – again, without charge – the lawyer is still struggling to make sense of what he witnessed at Megiddo. “I’m an Israeli…I’m a lawyer,” he told us. “I’ve seen the world outside the prison. Now I’m inside. I see another world.” His faith in citizenship and the rule of law, he says, has been shattered. “It was all crushed after this experience.” We put claims of the widespread mistreatment of Palestinian detainees to the authorities involved. The army said it “rejects outright allegations of systematic abuse of detainees”. “Concrete complaints regarding misconduct or unsatisfactory conditions of detention,” the army told us, “are forwarded to relevant bodies in the IDF, and are dealt with accordingly.” The prison service said it “was not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred”. Since 7 October, Israel has refused to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Palestinian detainees, as international law requires. No explanation has been given for this refusal, but the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently expressed its frustration over the ICRC’s failure to gain access to Israeli and other hostages being held in Gaza. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) has accused the government of “consciously defying international law”. Last week, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners ignited a furious public row, as far right demonstrators – including members of Israel’s parliament – violently tried to prevent the arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a prisoner from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military base. Some of those protesting were followers of Israel’s hardline security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, the man in overall charge of the prison service. Mr Ben Gvir has frequently boasted that under his watch, conditions for Palestinian detainees have deteriorated sharply. “I’m proud that during my time we changed all the conditions,” he told members of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, during a rowdy session in July. For B’Tselem, Mr Ben Gvir bears a heavy responsibility for the abuses now being reported. “These systems were put in the hands of the most right wing, most racist minister that Israel ever had,” Yuli Novak told us. For her, Israel’s treatment of prisoners, in the wake of the traumatic events of 7 October, is a dangerous indicator of the nation’s moral decline. “The trauma and anxiety walks with us each and every day,” she says. “But to let this thing turn us into something that it not human, that doesn’t see people, I think is tragic.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg64642q0dxo,Iran says Hamas leader killed from close range,Western media reports suggest Israel's secret service planted bombs inside the building Ismail Haniyeh was staying in.,3 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.256720,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed with a ""short-range projectile"" fired from outside his guesthouse in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says. The paramilitary organisation said the projectile weighed about 7kg (16lbs) and caused a ""strong blast"", killing Haniyeh and his bodyguard last Wednesday. The Hamas leader had been visiting the Iranian capital for the inauguration of President Massoud Pezeshkian. The IRGC accused Israel of designing and implementing the operation - supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. The IRGC account is at odds with reports in Western media, which have suggested that explosives were planted in the guesthouse by Israeli operatives. The failures surrounding Haniyeh's death, especially on a day marked by intense security, have caused embarrassment for Iran and the IRGC.   Dozens of IRGC officers have been arrested or dismissed in the days since Haniyeh's death, the New York Times reported on Saturday.  The paper said the organisation's intelligence agency had taken over the investigation. Staff members at Haniyeh's guesthouse have been interrogated and their phones and other electronics have been seized, it added.  Meanwhile, the security details of Iranian politicians have been overhauled. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh on Thursday, but was whisked away soon after the ceremony by his security detail.  The IRGC's statement on Saturday came after Britain's Daily Telegraph said Haniyeh was killed by bombs planted in his room by agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency  Citing Iranian officials, the paper said two Mossad agents had entered the guesthouse and planted explosives in three rooms. The Iranians, who had viewed CCTV footage of the operatives, said the two subsequently left the country before detonating the bombs from outside Iran. The New York Times also reported that Haniyeh was killed by explosives detonated in his room, saying they could have been planted up to two months earlier.  The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.  But Hamas officials told the BBC earlier this week that Haniyeh had stayed at the same guesthouse before. He had made up to 15 visits to Iran since becoming the head of the political bureau in 2017.  The papers' reports - if true - would represent an even bigger failure for the IRGC, who have long controlled internal security in the country. Experts also said it would highlight the degree to which Mossad can operate with impunity in Iran.  Regardless of the manner of Haniyeh's death, both Iran and Hamas have vowed to retaliate.  The IRGC said on Saturday that Israel would receive ""a severe punishment at the appropriate time, place and manner"". Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group in Lebanon, has also vowed reprisals. One of their top commanders, Fuad Shukr, was killed in an Israeli strike last Tuesday. After an Israeli operation killed IRGC Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi in Damascus earlier this year, Iran fired 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and at least 110 ballistic missiles towards Israel.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... We have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". His ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on the country's communication infrastructure.  Despite the government's warnings, the mood appeared relaxed on Tel Aviv's seafront, with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas. But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full-scale war. Israel is on high alert and several international airlines have suspended flights to the country. The US has also deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has warned that the risk that ""the situation on the ground could deteriorate rapidly is rising"". Meanwhile, at least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Hamas-run government media office has said.  It comes as Israel said an airstrike it conducted in the occupied West Bank killed a Hamas commander and four senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters on Saturday.  The Israeli military said the air strike hit a vehicle as the men were on the way to carry out an attack.  Elsewhere, Israeli officials - including the directors of Mossad and the internal security agency Shin Bet - have arrived in Cairo for fresh ceasefire talks.  They will meet Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, and other senior military officials in a bid to rescue a potential truce. But US President Joe Biden admitted on Friday that Haniyeh's death had damaged the talks.  Haniyeh was heavily involved in negotiations and Mr Biden said his death “doesn’t help” efforts to end the ten-month old conflict.  The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,550 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Tensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Missile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was ""ironclad"". Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel for the assassination of Haniyeh. The Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented. Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza war. His death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed Fuad Shukr, the top military commander of Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. A Pentagon statement said the new deployments would ""improve US force protection... increase support for the defence of Israel, and ... ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies"". The deployments would include additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, it said. On Tel Aviv’s seafront, the mood appears relaxed with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas. But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full- scale war. Israel is on high alert.  Several international airlines have suspended flights to the country.  Meanwhile, Israeli ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on communication infrastructure. Earlier on Saturday, Israeli forces killed a Hamas operative in the West Bank. Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed in strikes on Gaza in the last 24 hours - a reminder that Israel’s war in the region continues even as diplomats scramble to prevent its escalation. The US military has stepped-up deployments before, on 13 April when Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles. Israel and its allies shot down almost all of roughly 300 drones and missiles that were fired. Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Haniyeh. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered ""crushing blows"" to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of Shukr in Beirut. He warned Israelis that ""challenging days lie ahead... we have heard threats from all sides. We are prepared for any scenario"". Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable. ""I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don't want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off-ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal,"" Singh said. An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Mr Netanyahu said on Friday. Hamas sparked the war with its 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in Gaza that has killed almost 40,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The circumstances surrounding Haniyeh's death are, as yet, still unclear. On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that Iranian agents hired by Israel's Mossad spy agency had planted bombs in a building where Haniyeh was staying. The newspaper says that two agents placed bombs in three rooms of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp guesthouse in Tehran, which were detonated from abroad. An earlier report by the New York Times said that the bombs had been snuck into the building two months earlier.  The BBC has not been able to verify these claims."

Some of those killed were displaced people sheltering at the schools, rescuers said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the strikes, saying it had targeted Hamas ""command and control centres"" within two schools in Gaza City. The strikes were the third time in a week schools in Gaza have been hit by Israeli strikes.  The IDF said: ""The schools were used by Hamas's al-Furqan Battalion as a hiding place for its terrorist operatives and as command centres used to plan and execute attacks against IDF troops and the state of Israel."" Footage on social media purported to show bodies inside one of the schools as rescuers evacuated casualties, including children. Palestinian media said at least 30 people were killed in the strikes. Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Defence, said most of the dead were women and children. He added that more people were believed to be buried under the rubble. The attack on the al-Nasr and Hassan Salama schools came on the day of an attack on a camp for displaced people in a hospital in central Gaza, which reportedly killed at least five people.  On Saturday, officials said an air strike on Hamama School in Gaza City had killed at least 17 people.  Days earlier, a strike on Dalal al-Mughrabi School killed 15, according to officials. The IDF says it takes care to minimise risk to civilians when conducting strikes but the Palestinian Civil Defence described Sunday's attacks as ""a massacre"".  In a separate development on Sunday morning, two people were killed in a stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Holon. The Palestinian attacker was later shot dead, police said. The Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October, when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

The attack comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Middle East was at a critical moment following the killings of senior leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. Officials told the BBC’s partner CBS News that the Al Asad airbase in western Iraq was attacked and that they are still assessing the damage. They have not yet said who was behind the attack. Security sources told CBS that two Katyusha rockets were fired at the base, and that one had fallen inside the base. “We can confirm that there was a suspected rocket attack today against US and Coalition forces at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq,” said a Department of Defence spokesperson. “Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured. Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” the spokesperson added. It is unclear how many US personnel were injured. A senior US military official said no critical injuries, such as a loss of limbs, have been reported at this time, and no service members were killed. President Joe Biden was briefed on the suspected attack, a White House official said. In a statement on X, Mr Biden said he and vice-president Kamala Harris were briefed in the Situation Room on ""developments on the Middle East.""  ""We received updates on threats posed by Iran and its proxies, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, and preparations to support Israel should it be attacked again,"" the president said. ""We also discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing."" The attack comes after the US carried out a strike in Iraq last week that was described as an act of self-defence against militants who officials said were preparing to launch drones against US and coalition forces in the region. Tensions have been escalating following the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last Wednesday by a blast at his guesthouse. Iran’s revolutionary guard (IRGC) has accused Israel of killing Haniyeh and said it was supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. Also last week, Israel said it killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on a southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killings. The Al Asad base was attacked in January this year by Iranian-backed militias, who launched ballistic missiles and rockets - most of which were intercepted, US Central Command said at the time. A number of US personnel were assessed for traumatic brain injuries after the attack, while at least one Iraqi service member was wounded. The airbase has been used by the US since 2004, following the invasion of Iraq, and has been visited by former US presidents George W Bush and later Donald Trump. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05v009n2ko,Hezbollah leader says conflict with Israel in 'new phase' after killings,"The killing of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders crossed ""red lines"", Hassan Nasrallah says, but he stops short of declaring all-out war.",2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.667055,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"In Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiya, the stronghold of Hezbollah, large crowds wearing black joined the funeral for Fuad Shukr, a senior commander of the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement, and the most high-profile member to have been assassinated by Israel during these current hostilities. They carried placards with Shukr’s face, waved the yellow-and-green Hezbollah flag and chanted some of the group’s slogans, sometimes with their fists in the air. According to the Israeli military, Shukr was behind a missile strike that killed 12 children and teenagers on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last Saturday. Hezbollah has denied involvement, although it initially claimed an attack on a nearby military base, which raised the possibility that the missile missed its intended targeted. Shukr, who was also known as Sayyed Mohsin, was said to be a close adviser to Hassan Nasrallah, the influential and long-time Hezbollah leader. As people were gathered, Nasrallah gave a televised speech that was watched closely for any indication of Hezbollah’s possible next moves. The conflict with Israel had entered a “new phase"", he said, speaking from a secret location, as he always does for security reasons. The enemy must wait for the “inevitable response” because it had crossed “red lines”, he added, saying that the reaction would be proportionate to Israel’s targeting of a civilian building. His tone seemed to indicate that the group remained uninterested in another major war with Israel. But there are concerns that they could be sliding into one. “I’m not afraid of war. We’re ready for whatever Sayyed [Hassan] Nasrallah decides to do,” one man in the crowd told me. “Inshallah,” said another, meaning God willing, when asked if he believed that Hezbollah would retaliate for the killing. Shukr's killing on Tuesday - an attack that killed six other people, including two young siblings - renewed fears that the relatively contained conflict between Hezbollah and Israel could escalate into an all-out war, with the potential to engulf the entire Middle East. Hezbollah says its campaign, which started a day after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, is in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Most of the group’s attacks, and Israel’s counterattacks, have been limited to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border. Supported by Iran, Hezbollah has long been seen by Israel as a much more formidable foe than Hamas. The group has an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weapons that includes attack drones and precision guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. A conflict with Hezbollah would probably involve other Iranian-supported groups in the region, members of what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance” - the Houthis in Yemen or militias in Iraq, for example.  Iran, too, has vowed to respond to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political chief who was killed on Wednesday while visiting Tehran for the inauguration of the new Iranian president.  Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel, which has stayed silent. The killing has dealt a blow to the possibility of any success in ongoing talks for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. It is the main hope to defuse tensions with Hezbollah, and diplomatic efforts continue to try to de-escalate the situation. The Israeli military has said it is ready for any scenario, as the country braces itself for a possible response to the two assassinations. Nasrallah’s speech contained, as expected, sharp words against Israel but did not appear to suggest that a bigger war was imminent just yet."

His comments came during an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of states with Muslim-majority populations, which convened in Saudi Arabia to discuss Iran’s response to the killing. The US said it hoped OIC members would caution Iran against taking “steps to escalate the conflict”. Tensions in the Middle East have soared since Haniyeh’s assassination in Tehran last week. Iran and its allies blamed Israel, though Israel has not commented. The OIC convened in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Wednesday, at the request of Iranian and Palestinian officials.  Acting Iranian Foreign Minister Baqeri Ali Bagheri Kani told members “it is expected” that they support Iran’s response to the killing. “Iran's action is not only a defence of its own sovereignty and national security but also a defence of the stability and security of the entire region,"" he said. A statement later released by the OIC said the bloc holds Israel ""fully responsible"" for the ""heinous attack"", which it described as ""a serious infringement"" of Iran's sovereignty. But it stopped short of endorsing any Iranian military action. In April, Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel - nearly all of which were shot down - in retaliation to an attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria. Many fear Iran's response on this occasion could take a similar form. OIC Chair Mamadou Tangara said Haniyeh’s killing had the potential to cause “a wider conflict that could involve the entire region"". The killing ""will not quell the Palestinian cause but rather it amplifies it,” he said. Saudi Arabia commented on the killing for the first time on Wednesday, with deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji calling it a ""blatant violation"" of Iran's sovereignty. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that the US hoped ""all parties that have a relationship with Iran impress upon Iran, the same way we've been impressing upon the government of Israel, that they shouldn't take any steps to escalate the conflict"". Miller said the US had been in contact with some members of the OIC and believed there is a ""broad consensus"" that ""escalation would only exacerbate the problems facing the region"". Diplomatic efforts have been ongoing since the start of the week, with US President Joe Biden speaking on the phone to the leaders of Jordan, Qatar and Egypt on Tuesday. ""No one should escalate this conflict. We've been engaged in intense diplomacy with allies and partners, communicating that message directly to Iran. We communicated that message directly to Israel,"" US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Tuesday. In a phone call on Wednesday, French president Emmanuel Macron told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that an Iranian escalation “would lastingly harm regional stability.” Pezeshkian told Macron that if the West wants to prevent war it ""should immediately stop selling arms and supporting"" Israel, his office said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3gpy74ydo,"Hamas military chief was killed in July strike, Israel says","Hamas has not confirmed the death of Mohammed Deif, who led the group's military wing.",1 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.875496,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's military says it has confirmed that Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip last month. Deif was targeted in the strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area on 13 July. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. On Wednesday, Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran. Israel has not commented on his death directly.  The Israeli military said in a statement that ""following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated"" in the 13 July strike. Gaza’s Hamas-run health authorities said at the time of the air strike that it had killed more than 90 people, but denied that Deif was among the dead. Deif is widely seen as the second-ranking Hamas official in Gaza, behind Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in the territory.  Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the death of Deif is “a significant milestone” in the dismantling of Hamas. ""This operation reflects the fact that Hamas is disintegrating, and that Hamas terrorists may either surrender or they will be eliminated,"" he added. Mohammed Deif was appointed head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement, in 2002.  For decades he's been seen as one of Israel's most wanted men - and has survived a reported seven assassination attempts, including one that reportedly saw him lose an eye. He was born in Gaza's Khan Younis refugee camp in 1965, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. As a young man in the late 1980s, he joined Hamas shortly after its formation and quickly rose to prominence within the group. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s.   Deif is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to enter Israel from Gaza.  During his leadership of the al-Qassam brigades, he was credited with designing Hamas's signature weapon, the Qassam rocket. In 2014, Israel attempted to kill Deif with an air strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza, which killed Deif's wife, Widad, and their infant son, Ali. Israel thought it had killed Deif, too, but he was not in the building at the time. Enemies are known to have dubbed Deif ‘the cat with nine lives’, due to the fact he survived so many attempts on his life. During the current conflict, Deif is believed to have directed Hamas' military operations from within underground tunnels inside Gaza.  Israel's confirmation of Deif's death comes at the end of a turbulent week in the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has stoked fears of a broader regional war. On Saturday, 12 Druze children and young people were killed after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon-based Hezbollah, saying they would pay ""a heavy price"". On Tuesday, Israel retorted with air strike on Beirut which killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, as well as four others, including two children. Hours later, Hamas’s political leader Ismael Haniyeh was killed in a strike on a building he was staying in during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran. Iran has blamed Israel for Haniyeh's death, threatening “harsh punishment”. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg798l439ydo,Harris rejects claims she would support Israel arms embargo,The news comes after Ms Harris was heckled at a rally in Michigan by pro-Palestinian protestors.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:24.627414,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Kamala Harris will not support an arms embargo on Israel, her national security adviser says, a day after the presidential candidate was heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters at a rally in Detroit. In a post on Twitter/X, Biden administration official Phil Gordon said Ms Harris ""has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups"". The statement came after leaders of the Uncommitted movement - which has urged Democrats to boycott the election over US support for Israel - said Ms Harris had ""expressed an openness"" to meeting with them to discuss an arms embargo.  Mr Gordon seemed to dispute that report. He added that Ms Harris ""will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law"". His statement comes as tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate. Iran has threatened to ""punish"" Israel after the assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Israel has not claimed responsibility.  The US has accelerated its weapon supplies to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attacks. Both Mr Biden and Ms Harris have called for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid in Gaza.  Since Mr Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his second in command, leaders of the Uncommitted movement have been pressing Ms Harris to halt US military support for Israel.  Ms Harris's rally on Wednesday took place in a swing state that is home to the largest Arab-American community in the US.  Leaders of the Uncommitted movement said in a statement that they had a chance to speak to the vice-president before the rally and told her that the US needed an arms embargo. ""We want to support you, Vice-President Harris, and our voters need to see you turn a new page on Gaza policy that includes embracing an arms embargo,"" Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of Uncommitted, said he told the Democratic nominee.  Afterwards, a number of pro-Palestinian protestors gathered at the rally and interrupted Ms Harris's speech, chanting: ""Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won’t vote for genocide"". Ms Harris responded by telling the crowd: ""Everyone's voice matters.""  But as the protestors continued to chant, she stopped again and said: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” Both JD Vance, Trump's running mate, and Ms Harris have made a number campaign stops in the Midwest this week as they try to woo voters in critical swing states.  The latest poll, from Marquette University Law School, shows Ms Harris is leading Trump 53% to 47% among likely voters, a big bump from when Mr Biden was still in the race and was trailing Trump nationally and in several battleground states.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wgqypwrxo,Bowen: Israel's killing of Haniyeh deals hammer blow to ceasefire prospects,"The Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and it is widely believed Israel was behind the killing.",1 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:24.728911,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel has inflicted two devastating blows on its enemies. It has not confirmed that it killed the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but it is hard to see who else would have wanted him dead more than the Israelis. As for the Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Israel says he was killed in Beirut in an “intelligence-based elimination”. For Israel, everyone senior in Hamas is a legitimate target after the attacks of 7 October 2023, which inflicted the worst single day of bloodshed on Israel since independence in 1948. Fuad Shukr, Israel says, was killed because as a veteran Hezbollah commander he was responsible for the rocket attack that killed 12 children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah has confirmed he was killed in the raid on Beirut. It denies carrying out the attack in the Golan. Once again, the Middle East is full of speculation that the all-out war feared since 7 October is imminent. The deadly irony is no side wants that war, but increasingly they are prepared to risk it. The Israelis have been under pressure from their American allies to calibrate their response to Hezbollah, inflicting a blow that will hurt the group without provoking a devastating retaliation and igniting a wider and deeper war. But two assassinations amount to a major gamble. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, might still decide that an attack on their stronghold in southern Beirut warrants a matching attack on Tel Aviv. Israel might also have calculated that Iran would not go to war over an assassinated Palestinian leader, even though his death in their capital, under their protection, is a humiliation. Killing Haniyeh, just after he had met the new Iranian president, is a dramatic display of Israel’s reach. The Islamic Republic thought it re-established deterrence when it fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in April - that claim has now been exposed as hollow. April’s barrage was also retaliation, for the Israeli air strike that killed two Iranian generals in Iran’s embassy in Damascus. More retaliation looks certain from Iran, its ally Hezbollah or one of its proxies. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq have made it clear that they blame the US equally for what has happened. In the Red Sea, the Houthis might redouble their attacks out of Yemen. There are limits to what Hamas can do, after months of the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. But the Israelis are on high alert for attacks in the occupied West Bank or inside Israel itself. It is important to realise that the Middle East is already in a regional war, but also to recognise that it could get much worse. Even so, this round of killing and retaliation might not be the spark that ignites all-out war, though it is easy to construct scenarios based on the clear and dangerous risks and realities in the world’s most turbulent region. Pulling back from the brink, repeatedly, is not making war any less likely. It makes it harder to construct a diplomatic pathway away from the looming threat of all-out conflict. The only credible first step for lowering the deadly temperature in the Middle East is a ceasefire in Gaza. In recent weeks the Americans have said that it was getting closer. That was always hard to imagine while the two sides’ definitions of an acceptable ceasefire were so far apart. For Hamas, a ceasefire meant an Israeli withdrawal and the end of hostilities. For Israel, it meant a pause that allowed for the release of some or all of the surviving hostages, and the right to resume the war afterwards. Now a ceasefire in Gaza looks as far away as ever, although the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said again that it remains America’s diplomatic priority. Ismail Haniyeh was a leading figure on the Hamas side in the ceasefire talks. With his colleagues, he communicated with the US and Israel via the head of the Egyptian secret service and the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohamed bin Jassim al Thani. The prime minister posted his response to the assassination of Haniyeh on X, writing: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask how mediation can succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side.” The assassination fits more closely into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conception of “total victory” over Hamas than into the American idea that a ceasefire is vital to avoid an even deeper regional catastrophe. It will also strengthen the belief held by Mr Netanyahu’s critics inside and outside Israel that he wants to prolong the war, to avoid the moment when he faces a reckoning of the mistakes he made that allowed Hamas the space to attack with such devastating consequences on 7 October. The Americans and French have also worked hard to find a diplomatic way to stop the border war between Israel and Hezbollah. But the vital first step would be a ceasefire in Gaza, and the prospect one was close has taken another hammer blow."

Councillor Habib Rahman, who came to Newcastle from Bangladesh more than 40 years ago, says there needs to be a ""sensible, grown-up debate"" on immigration and thinks people with legitimate concerns have been ""sucked into"" supporting demonstrations organised by the far right. The Elswick ward councillor condemned the riots that have taken place around north-east England over the past week, and attributed the violence to ""misinformation"". The Home Office has been approached for comment. Mr Rahman told BBC Radio Newcastle people were right to ""echo their frustration"" at the ""huge inequality in our society"". He cited issues such as youth unemployment, educational attainment and a ""lack of future"" as reasons for individuals believing misinformation about asylum seekers and refugees. ""When someone is faced with those deep inequalities, a lot of the time they're sucked into supporting the far-right movement,"" he said. Mr Rahman believes immigration ""is a problem"" but that there is a lot of misunderstanding about asylum seekers. ""When I hear people say people who enter our shores are getting a house, a car, a fridge, hundreds of pounds - [this is] nonsense,"" he said.  ""The Home Office, the government, needs to explicitly put it out that if you enter this country and seek asylum, no, you don't get luxuries."" Mr Rahman became Newcastle's first Muslim lord mayor in 2021 and quit the Labour Party earlier this year in protest over its stance on the Israel-Gaza war, labelling the party a ""culture of institutional racism"". ""I'm a migrant,"" the former lord mayor continued. ""I've lived here for the last 40-odd years.  ""Britain is my country, Newcastle is my city - it's my home.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwr8lj9jro,Al Jazeera rebuffs Israeli claim killed journalist was Hamas operative,"Israel said Ismail al-Ghoul took part in the 7 October attack, but Al Jazeera said that was a lie.",2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:24.944881,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Al Jazeera has strongly rejected the Israeli military’s claim that its correspondent killed in an air strike in Gaza this week was a Hamas operative who participated in the 7 October attacks. Harrowing video shared on social media showed Ismail al-Ghoul’s decapitated body after he was targeted in his car in Gaza City on Wednesday. His cameraman, Rami al-Rifi, and a boy passing on a bicycle, Khalid Shawa, were also killed. While regional news this week has been dominated by other high-profile assassinations, many Palestinians have also focused on the killing of the locally prominent journalist. In a statement on Thursday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) described Ismail al-Ghoul as a “Hamas military wing operative and Nukhba terrorist” - the assertion being he was part of an elite unit in the armed group. It alleged that as part of his role he “instructed other operatives on how to record operations and was actively involved in recording and publicising attacks against IDF troops”. The IDF did not include Rami al-Rifi in its statement. Al Jazeera called the accusation against its staff member “baseless” and said it “highlights Israel’s long history of fabrications and false evidence used to cover up its heinous crimes”.  Ismail's brother Jihad also told the BBC that his late sibling was strictly a civilian “portraying the suffering of the Palestinian people inside Gaza City to the outside world”. Based in Gaza City, the reporter had become a regular face on the Qatar-based TV channel, which is a popular news source in the region but has faced intense criticism from Israeli authorities. As Friday prayers in Gaza were dedicated to the late Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran, some Palestinians said they were also thinking about those who had been killed closer to home. “I am truly heartbroken about Ismail [al-Ghoul],” commented Maha Sarsak, who has been displaced from Shujaiyeh to the centre of the strip. “I was keeping up on the news in the north through him on social media. We didn’t always have a TV, but we could hear his voice on the radio.” Journalists in Gaza laid down their flak jackets at one gathering to honour al-Ghoul and al-Rifi this week. A friend of the pair said: “They hadn’t been sleeping for days nor eating. They had even lost a lot of weight.” Ismail al-Ghoul covered Israel’s raid of Shifa Hospital in March and was arrested by the IDF at the site - but released after 12 hours without charge. Al Jazeera claimed this “debunks and refutes their false claim of his affiliation with any organisation”. The two Al Jazeera journalists’ last assignment had been gathering reaction to news of Haniyeh’s death. Their car was targeted close to the Hamas leader’s destroyed house in Shati Camp, an urban refugee camp. Israel has blocked international journalists from entering the Palestinian territory during the war, except on limited and highly controlled visits with the Israeli military. Prior to the closure of its Rafah border crossing with Gaza, Egypt also prevented reporters from entering. Over 10 months, many networks, including the BBC, have relied on local Palestinian staff for their on-the-ground news coverage and taken on new employees or freelancers. Al Jazeera said that Ismail al-Ghoul had been working for the channel since November. It said that he had endured “hardships” during the war including losing his father and brother. Other cameramen spoke of how al-Rifi had used his technical expertise to help them with their filming. After images of a dead Khaled al-Shawa, the boy killed in the strike, were widely publicised, the boy’s mother put out a message on social media pleading for him to be remembered too. “My son is not an unidentified martyr,” she said.  “We must say the names of our martyrs. They should not talk about us as numbers.” Al Jazeera, which broadcasts in English and Arabic, has recently seen a series of attacks against its staff in Gaza and their families. In late October, Wael Dahdouh, the network’s well-known bureau chief, was reporting when he received word on-air that his wife, daughter, a son, and grandchild were killed in an Israeli airstrike. In December, he was injured in an attack that also killed another Al Jazeera cameraman, Samer Abudaqa. In January, a strike killed Mr Dahdouh’s son, Hamza, and Mustafa Thuria, a video stringer, while they were working for Al Jazeera. The IDF later alleged the men were “members of Gaza-based terrorist organizations"". Al Jazeera has previously fiercely denied Israel’s claims and accused it of systematically targeting its employees.  The network has also condemned the decision by Israel’s government in May to ban its broadcast in the country on accusations it harms national security. Last month, the ban was extended by the Tel Aviv District Court. The United Nations has called for a full investigation and accountability for the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists and others, saying that journalists everywhere must be protected. There are differing tallies of the number of media workers killed since the unprecedented, deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel that prompted the war in Gaza. However, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the latest deaths in Gaza bring the number of journalists killed to 113, including 108 Palestinians, three Lebanese and two Israelis who were killed during the 7 October assault."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql8ly2g10no,"Killing of Hamas leader 'doesn't help' ceasefire talks, says Biden",The US president made the criticism in his first comments on the apparent Israeli assassination.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:25.109451,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US President Joe Biden has said that the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh “doesn’t help” talks over a potential ceasefire in Gaza. Haniyeh was killed during a visit to Iran’s capital, Tehran, on Wednesday. Iran and its allies have blamed Israel, although Israel is yet to comment on his death. Haniyeh was Hamas’s most senior official and was highly involved in ceasefire and hostage release talks from his base in Qatar. Mr Biden said he was “very concerned” about rising tensions in the Middle East. ""We have the basis for a ceasefire. He [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] should move on it and they [Hamas] should move on it now."" Israel and Hamas recently resumed tentative, indirect talks to try to reach a ceasefire in the war in Gaza, though there have been conflicting accounts of progress. At the end of May, Mr Biden outlined what he said were the terms of an Israeli ceasefire proposal. This has become the basis for on-off indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel since then, with Qatar, Egypt and the US acting as mediators.  Earlier this week, Israel and Hamas accused each other of obstructing progress. Hamas said Israel had introduced new conditions, while Mr Netanyahu's office said Hamas had demanded 29 changes to the proposal. The war began in October when Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered a massive Israeli military response, which has killed at least 39,480 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.  Mr Biden's comments were his first on Haniyeh's assassination since the Hamas chief was killed. The US president spoke to journalists at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, ahead of welcoming home American citizens as part of a prisoner exchange with Russia. He said he had spoken to Mr Netanyahu earlier on Thursday and had promised to protect Israel ""against all threats from Iran"", which has vowed to retaliate. Iran is Hamas's most important backer and is an arch-foe of Israel. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Mr Netanyahu said after the killing that Israel had delivered “crushing blows” to Iran’s proxy groups in recent days.  Haniyeh’s assassination came at a time of soaring tensions in the Middle East. On Saturday, 12 children and young people were killed after a strike on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel blamed Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement and vowed ""severe"" retaliation, though Hezbollah has denied involvement.  On Tuesday, hours before the killing of Haniyeh, Israel killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, who it said was behind the attack on the Golan Heights, in a targeted air strike in Beirut."

Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran early on Wednesday. However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon hours before the Tehran strike. He warned Israelis that “challenging days lie ahead”, as fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow. ""Since the strike in Beirut, we have heard threats from all sides,"" he told a televised address. ""We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a ""dangerous escalation"" of hostilities in the region.  Hamas's armed wing said the death of Haniyeh, who was widely viewed as the group's overall leader, would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. The group attacked Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people. Since the attack, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Haniyeh, who played an important role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza, was killed hours after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in Tehran. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the killing took place in the same building where Haniyeh had stayed during previous visits to Iran. Three Hamas leaders and a number of guards were with him in the same building, they said. Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told a news conference that a missile hit Haniyeh ""directly"", citing witnesses who were with him. The group's leadership has been left in ""a state of shock"", top Hamas officials have told the BBC. Hours before Haniyeh was targeted, Israel said it had killed senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Israel believes he was responsible for a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied any involvement. The Iran-backed group confirmed Shukr's body was found among the rubble of the residential building which was struck. Four other people, including two children, were killed. A response from Hezbollah is almost certain. In the past, the heavily-armed, Iranian-supported group has responded to the killings of senior members by firing barrages of rockets into Israel. The US has updated its travel guidance for citizens, advising them not to travel to Lebanon due to ""rising tensions"", and the UK foreign secretary has urged nationals to leave the country. Several airlines have cancelled flights to Beirut, while United, Delta and British Airways are expected to announce they are suspending flights to Tel Aviv."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728vj21qepo,'Still alive' - graduate Asmaa's texts to BBC from the ruins of Gaza,A young woman's sporadic messages to the BBC's Paul Adams give unique insight into life in Gaza.,3 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:25.264974,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"For six years the BBC’s Paul Adams has been in contact with a young graduate in Gaza. Her text messages give a unique insight into the terrors and small triumphs she has experienced during the current conflict, and her fears for the future. My phone lights up. It is Asmaa. “Still alive,” she writes. It is 19 March 2024 and after several weeks of silence, Asmaa Tayeh has reappeared on WhatsApp. “Sorry. Bad internet connection and dangerous days.” And then silence. For another two months. It has been like this since 7 October. Long disappearances, punctuated by flurries of text messages, as the 28-year-old emerges, briefly, amid the nightmare of Gaza’s longest war. It is always late at night. Somewhere, Asmaa has found a signal. Far away in London, my phone pings as the messages tumble in. I met Asmaa in 2018. I was in Gaza, reporting on daily protests at the border fence with Israel, where thousands of mostly young Palestinians angrily commemorated their ancestors’ displacement during Israel’s War of Independence, 70 years earlier. Asmaa was not part of the protests. I found her at her family’s home a few miles away in Jabalia, quietly writing stories, some of which I had read online, about daily life in a place she both loved and hated. Her laptop was a cherished portal to the world outside. She had only ever known the Gaza Strip and its stifling sense of isolation. From her spartan room, she watched vloggers and Youtubers casually exploring places she could only dream of. As a recent graduate in a place with few job prospects and frequent outbreaks of extreme violence, the exotic images flashing onto her computer screen were intoxicating but painful. “They show me how handcuffed I am,” she wrote that year. A refugee camp of tents and tin shacks in the 1950s, Jabalia had long since morphed into a small city, more than 100,000 people crammed together in a place of tall buildings, teeming alleyways and open sewers. Despite her narrow confines, the young Asmaa was hopeful. In September 2022, she launched her own business, Star Café, an online coffee delivery service. Her social media feeds suggested an optimistic young entrepreneur, finally achieving long-cherished goals and planning for the future. A year later, on 6 October 2023, in an Instagram post artfully depicting her branded products alongside a vase of roses and a manicured hand, she thanked God for “the blessing of self-employment”. But what she didn’t know was that a meteor was hurtling in her direction, about to obliterate everything. The following day, Hamas gunmen stormed across the border fence, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners in nearby communities and at the Nova music festival. Israel’s response was like nothing Gazans had ever seen before. Its military would go on to kill tens of thousands of people, displace more than 80% of the population, and render large parts of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable. Three days later, on 10 October, Asmaa got in touch. “Hey Paul. It’s nice to hear from you. We are unharmed,” she messaged. “But to be honest, I don’t feel safe at all. We could be bombed at any minute.” Despite hearing air strikes hitting nearby targets, Asmaa was hopeful the war would soon be over. But this was not a repeat of earlier Gaza wars. Within days, Israeli planes dropped leaflets, telling everyone in the northern Gaza Strip - more than one million people - to move south. Jabalia started to empty, but Asmaa’s family - 13 people spanning three generations - stayed put, fearing going south would prove a one-way journey. For the descendants of refugees who were forced or fled from their homes in 1948, never to return, the thought of history repeating itself stirred deep fears. Only her grandparents, elderly and frail, travelled, eventually finding shelter in Rafah. With electricity cut, food in freezers spoiling, and communications increasingly difficult, the family used a small generator every couple of days to charge mobiles and monitor the news. Asmaa’s messages were becoming increasingly sporadic. “It’s dangerous all over the Gaza Strip,” she told me on 15 October. At the end of October, Jabalia experienced its worst air strikes so far. Israel said it had targeted underground Hamas structures and killed large numbers of fighters. The scenes were apocalyptic, with civilians and rescue workers searching for survivors through vast craters and wrecked buildings. Asmaa vanished. My WhatsApp messages were no longer being read. I assumed the worst. But six weeks later, she suddenly reappeared. “I’m still alive, by God’s miracles,” she wrote on 12 December. It did, indeed, feel miraculous. In a torrent of messages that followed, Asmaa described the previous chaotic weeks. The family’s reluctant decision to leave Jabalia, efforts to head south thwarted by the intensity of the fighting, terrifying journeys through a city at war. “I saw so much that I cannot find words to describe,” she said. “The streets are scary and the smell of death is everywhere. People are getting skinny and sick. I feel like I’m living inside a horror movie.” When forced to walk, the family would spread out along the road, hoping this would improve their chances of survival. “We kept distance between us, so if any air strike comes, not all of us will die.” During a week-long ceasefire in late November, the family had briefly returned to the house in Jabalia. The top floor was gone. Asmaa’s own room, which had doubled up as her Star Café office and studio, was pockmarked by shrapnel. When the ceasefire collapsed on 1 December, they fled once more, finding refuge in a printing shop in Gaza City where one of Asmaa’s brothers had worked before the war. It was filthy, reeked of paint, and had no kitchen, mattresses, or water. “We basically lived with rats,” she says. When it was safe enough to go outside, they would walk, sometimes for hours, searching for clean water - especially vital to make up the formula for Asmaa’s two-month-old nephew. But after less than three weeks in the shop, Asmaa got a phone call from the Israeli army. She was used to the army’s recorded messages and leaflets dropped from the sky, with instructions to leave areas about to be attacked. But this time she found herself talking to a real person. The man said Israel was about to start an operation nearby. For her safety, and that of her family, she needed to leave. “I wanted to curse him, but I couldn’t.” She says she was curious, after two-and-a-half months of war, to find herself speaking to an Israeli. She imagined what it must feel like to spend your whole day making the same phone call over and over. “I felt like there is on the other side an employee who’s sick of his work.” For all the horrifying immediacy of the war consuming the north, this was as close as Asmaa ever came to meeting an Israeli soldier. Part of her wishes that she’d had more contact. “I’m really curious about the way they’re fighting, how they look at us, how they understand the struggle,” she told me later. “I feel like I need to dive inside their minds.” At the end of December, as the bulk of the fighting moved south, the family made its weary way back to the house in Jabalia. “We started the new year in the best way ever - all together in our partially-destroyed home.” Asmaa’s father,  a retired carpenter, spent the following weeks repairing the damage, fixing windows, doors and cupboards. But food was in desperately short supply. International aid agencies warned that famine was looming. Asmaa noticed that people in Jabalia were starting to look gaunt. Asmaa’s family had stocked up on canned goods. But flour, meat, fruit and vegetables had all disappeared from the markets. Aid agencies were struggling to bring humanitarian relief to the north. The family eked out their dwindling rations, ate twice a day, and drank tea without sugar - something practically unheard of among Palestinians. On the roof of the house, where her brother’s room had once stood, her father started growing vegetables. Asmaa had lost 9kg (almost 20lb) and felt her appetite ebbing away. But slowly, the humanitarian situation started to improve. Air drops and new aid routes into the north kept famine at bay. Flour was back. The family had chicken and tomatoes for the first time in months. There was more water, too. Enough for the occasional shower.  “We started to feel a little bit settled down.” But then the war came back. On 12 May, the Israeli army returned to Jabalia, saying intelligence indicated Hamas was once more operating out of the area. Asmaa was bewildered. “Only days ago, they were talking about a very possible ceasefire,” she wrote, “and suddenly I woke to ‘Let’s pack, we have to leave asap.’” The family went west, to an area known as al-Nasr, near the coast, where her grandparents had lived before the war. Al-Nasr was a wasteland, much of it reduced to rubble months earlier. But her grandparents’ house was intact. Long-since looted following their departure for the south, but somehow undamaged. The family moved in and settled down, wondering how long this third dislocation would last. One day, driven by curiosity, Asmaa walked to the nearby beach, where she marvelled at the sight of Gazans frolicking in the waves, despite the ominous presence of Israeli gunboats patrolling offshore. “We’ve started to feel careless,” she told me. “We don’t care for our lives any more. That’s how tired we are.” On 19 May came the news that Asmaa had long dreaded. Her grandfather had died the day before, aged 91. After being forced to move repeatedly, he and his wife had recently settled in a tent in al-Mawasi, a desperately overcrowded place of dismal conditions, where many Palestinians had fled after the Israeli army began an operation in Rafah at the start of the month. Sheltering in his abandoned house, Asmaa felt bereft. She hadn’t seen her grandfather since just before the war, when she had persuaded him to pose for a selfie. “I was so happy that I managed to take that memory.” Israeli forces finally left Jabalia on 1 June. Four days later, the family trudged back through streets so ravaged they were barely recognisable, to find their home still standing but increasingly battle-scarred. The whole process - of cleaning, repairing and planting - had to start again, made harder this time by the fact that a missile had destroyed the workshop where her father kept all his tools. For months, Asmaa and I had only ever communicated by text. Finally, in early July,  we spoke on the phone. Two long conversations in which Asmaa took me through her Gazan odyssey and described how it had changed her. Each time, her voice faded in and out and the line crackled, creating the impression of enormous distance. Each time, Israeli drones, ubiquitous since this war began, could be heard buzzing in the background. Asmaa said survival was a mixed blessing. Everyone in the house was alive. But the war wasn’t over and the threat of death was constant. “I feel anxious all the time, thinking that there will be one day in which I will lose something,” she said. “I mean, our turn will come.” Gaza, where Asmaa had nurtured her dreams, had been devastated. But it wasn’t the physical changes that were absorbing her the most. Society, she said, had been utterly transformed. The constant shocks of death, displacement and trauma leaving whole neighbourhoods teetering on the brink of disintegration. Tight-knit communities had been blown apart, she said, with family members and neighbours scattered up and down the length of the Gaza Strip, and beyond. Sometimes, in the struggle for survival, Gazans had turned on themselves. A total breakdown in law and order leaving gangs and rival families to battle it out for control of precious resources. “It’s becoming really normal to see people even killing each other,” Asmaa said. But if war had brought out the worst in people, it had also brought out the best. In Jabalia, Asmaa said, people were sharing food and water, exchanging the latest news and information on where to charge mobile phones. With basic foodstuffs once again in short supply, women were swapping improvised recipes. “Everyone is really taking care of each other.” Asmaa said it would take decades for Gazans to recover the meagre, confined, life they knew before 7 October. Defiant talk of reconstruction and renewal, she said, felt delusional. As for herself, Asmaa’s only dream now was to escape. “I don’t have any hope in this place,” she told me. “I’m not the same person any more. I don’t think I’ll recover.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clly4v4l13vo,What does Haniyeh's killing mean for Gaza ceasefire?,"As Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh was a key interlocutor in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations.",31 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:25.374227,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"We’re beginning to get some idea of how Ismail Haniyeh was killed. Early indications suggest that he and his bodyguards died when a rocket hit the house where he was staying in Tehran. All eyes will inevitably fall on Israel, which vowed to hunt down and punish all Hamas leaders following the brutal attacks of 7 October, in which around 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed. Israel typically does not comment on its operations abroad, but this attack may have followed the same pattern as an Israeli operation which targeted Iranian air defences around its nuclear facility in Natanz on 19 April. Israeli jets are believed to have fired rockets from outside Iranian airspace. But while details of the attack slowly emerge, its political consequences are also coming into focus. The most obvious is the likely damage to fragile efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza. Ismail Haniyeh may not have been in charge of day-to-day events on the ground in Gaza – that is the domain of the military commander Yahya Sinwar – but as the Hamas leader in exile he was a critical interlocutor in negotiations brokered by Qatar, the US and Egypt. American officials had recently suggested that ceasefire negotiations might soon succeed, although a meeting in Rome last weekend did not result in a breakthrough. But it is extremely hard to see how any progress can be made in the immediate wake of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.  All of which begs the question: If this was, as everyone assumes, an Israeli operation, why was it carried out? Beyond the desire to exact revenge on anyone associated with Hamas, what was Israel hoping to achieve? Turkey’s foreign ministry has already summed up the likely reaction of many in the region. ""It has been revealed once again that the government of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu has no intention of achieving peace,""  it said in a statement. In Ramallah, headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, news of Haniyeh’s death has been greeted with dismay. “It’s opening the door of hell,” Sabri Saidam, deputy secretary general of the Central Committee of the ruling party, Fatah, told the BBC. Mr Saidam said he was feeling a mixture of shock and anger. “Not only did I feel that Israel was targeting the life of Ismail Haniyeh,” he said, “but rather the life of any settlement in the region. Israel has killed all hopes and aspirations for an end to hostilities.” Fatah and Hamas have long been rivals, sometimes bloody rivals. But Mr Saidam strongly rejected the suggestion that Fatah might benefit from the death of the Hamas leader. “There's never been in Palestinian politics a feeling that leadership by elimination is the way forward,” he said. “If anything, it creates more resentment and more friction.” A strike has been called in Ramallah and across the West Bank.  Shops are closed and a protest march being held which could be an awkward moment for the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. The most recent opinion poll showed that Ismael Haniyeh was considerably more popular than the elderly Palestinian President, Mahmud Abbas. The timing of Haniyeh's killing suggests this was a wider part of Israel’s threatened retaliation for the Hezbollah rocket attack that killed 12 Druze children and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday - retaliation that included the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut on Tuesday. Israel had warned that its response would be harsh. Israeli officials regularly point out that Iran is the nexus for the so-called “arc of resistance” in the Middle East, which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, and the Houthis in Yemen. After dealing a blow to Hezbollah in Beirut (and recently to the Houthis in Hodeidah), killing the Hamas leader in Iran sends an emphatic, chilling message, to the militant groups and their Iranian backers: Israel can and will come after you, wherever you are."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wex26nl61o,What has happened to Hamas's most prominent leaders?,What we know about Hamas leaders since the start of the war with Israel.,1 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:25.454087,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Since the war began in Gaza following Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, its leaders have been targeted, allegedly by Israel. Some have been killed, others remain defiant. Here is a rundown of what has happened to Hamas's most prominent figures.  Ismail Haniyeh was widely considered Hamas's overall leader.  He was assassinated, reportedly in an aerial strike, on a building he was staying in during a visit to Tehran on 31 July, 2024. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the strike. A prominent member of Hamas in the late 1980s, Israel imprisoned Haniyeh for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising. He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders. After a year he returned to Gaza. In 1997 he was appointed head of the office of Hamas's spiritual leader, strengthening his position. Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections. But he was dismissed a year later amid deadly violence in Gaza, with Hamas ultimately ousting Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip. Haniyeh rejected his sacking as ""unconstitutional"", and Hamas continued to rule in Gaza. He was elected head of Hamas's all-powerful political bureau in 2017, making him in effect overall leader. In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the last several years. Yahya Sinwar is the leader of the Hamas movement within the Gaza Strip. Israel believes he masterminded the unprecedented attack on 7 October 2023. Sinwar was born in Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza in 1962. A year after Hamas was founded in 1987, he formed its internal security service, which amongst other things targeted alleged Palestinian collaborators with Israel. Sinwar was arrested by Israel three times. He was sentenced to four life terms in 1988 for planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians. However, in 2011 he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in exchange for an Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas for over five years. Sinwar returned to his position as a prominent leader in Hamas and was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017, making him Hamas's leader in the territory. In 2015, the US included Sinwar on its blacklist of ""international terrorists"". Sinwar has not been seen since the start of the war with Israel in October.  He is believed to still be in Gaza, hiding “10 storeys underground”, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. Mohammed Deif was the head of Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement. He was Israel's most wanted man for decades, and was killed in an Israeli air strike last month, Israel says. Hamas has not confirmed this. Deif, a shadowy figure, became known to Palestinians as The Mastermind, and to Israelis as The Cat with Nine Lives. Israeli authorities imprisoned him in 1989 during the first Palestinian intifada (uprising), and released him after a year and half. Soon afterwards he formed the al-Qassam Brigades, with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers. He also helped engineer the construction of tunnels that enabled Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza. Deif was accused by Israel of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. He was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in 2000, but escaped seven months later at the beginning of the second intifada. He became Israel's most wanted man, but since then left behind little trace.  The most serious assassination attempts on his life were in 2002: Deif survived but lost one of his eyes. Israel says he also lost a foot and a hand, and was left with difficulty speaking. Israel tried and failed again to assassinate Deif during a 2014 assault on the Gaza Strip, but killed his wife and two of his children. Deif was one of the figures accused of planning the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, 2023. Israel said it killed him in an air strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area of Gaza on 13 July.  Hamas has not confirmed that Marwan Issa, deputy commander-in-chief of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in March 2024, as reported by the White House. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he had been killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), following reports in Israeli media that he had died in a strike on a tunnel complex under the Nuseirat refugee camp. The senior commander is also known as the Shadow Man and has been viewed as Mohammed Deif's right-hand man. Prior to reports of his death, he was on Israel's most wanted list, and was injured when Israel attempted to assassinate him in 2006. Israeli forces detained him during the first intifada for five years because of his activity with Hamas. The Palestinian Authority arrested him in 1997, but he was freed after the second intifada in 2000. Israeli warplanes also destroyed his house twice during invasions of Gaza in 2014 and 2021, killing his brother. It was not known what he looked like until 2011, when he appeared in a group photo taken during a reception for exchanged prisoners. He is thought to have played a significant role in planning incursions into Israel, including the most recent. Khaled Meshaal, who was born in the West Bank in 1956, is considered one of the founders of Hamas. Under direct instructions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Mossad spy agency attempted to assassinate Meshaal in 1997 while he was living in Jordan. Mossad agents entered Jordan with forged Canadian passports and Meshaal was injected with a toxic substance while walking along a street. Jordanian authorities discovered the assassination attempt and arrested two Mossad members. The late King Hussein of Jordan asked Israel's prime minister for the antidote for the substance Meshaal was injected with. Facing pressure from then-US President Bill Clinton, Mr Netanyahu provided it, after initially rejecting the request. Meshaal, who lives in Qatar, visited the Gaza Strip for the first time in 2012. He was received by Palestinian officials and crowds of Palestinians came out to welcome him. Hamas elected Ismail Haniyeh to succeed Meshaal as head of its political bureau in 2017, and Meshaal became head of the group's political bureau abroad. Mahmoud Zahar was born in Gaza in 1945 to a Palestinian father and an Egyptian mother. He is considered one of Hamas' most prominent leaders, and a member of the movement's political leadership. He went to school in Gaza and university in Cairo, then worked as a doctor in Gaza and Khan Younis until Israeli authorities dismissed him over his political position. Mahmoud Zahar was held in Israeli prisons in 1988, months after the founding of Hamas. He was among those deported by Israel to no-man's land in 1992, where he spent a year. With the Hamas movement winning Palestinian general elections in 2006, Zahar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh's newly formed government before its eventual dismissal. Israel attempted to assassinate Zahar in 2003, when a plane dropped a bomb on his house in Gaza City. The attack left him with minor injuries, but killed his eldest son, Khaled. His second son, Hossam, who was a member of the al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza in 2008."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynl828yp0o,Row over Tory MP's Allahu Akbar arrest call,The Tory leadership hopeful says police should “immediately arrest” any protesters shouting Allahu Akbar.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:29.704989,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Conservative MP Robert Jenrick has defended himself after being accused of Islamophobia for saying police should have “immediately arrested” any protesters shouting Allahu Akbar during last year’s Gaza ceasefire protests. Speaking on Sky News, the Tory leadership candidate accused police of treating far-right marches and violence more harshly than the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that began after the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year. Several Muslim MPs have argued Mr Jenrick's claim linked all Muslims to extremism and fuelled violent groups. But Mr Jenrick said the Arabic phrase - meaning God is great - had been “abused” by “extremists” to intimidate people. He told Sky News he had been angered by the way pro-Palestinian demonstrations had been policed. “I have been very critical of police in the past, particularly around the attitude of some police forces to the protests we saw since 7 October. “I thought it was quite wrong that somebody could shout Allahu Akbar on the streets of London and not be immediately arrested, project genocidal chants on to Big Ben and not be immediately arrested.  ""That attitude is wrong and I’ll always call out the police for it.” Mr Jenrick said he stood by earlier comments that ""our streets to be dominated by Islamist extremists"". Pressed further, he said: ""There were instances back then where we saw Islamist extremists on our streets. ""I've just given you one example where you literally had somebody chanting or shouting Allahu Akbar off Oxford Street."" Mr Jenrick, a former home office minister, was criticised by former Conservative party chair Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and Labour MPs Naz Shah and Afzal Khan, among others.  In a social media post, Baroness Warsi said: ""Every day before we start parliamentary business in the Commons and Lords we say a prayer and praise God - we say our parliamentary version of Allahu Akbars at the heart of democracy - a process Robert Jenrick is a part of.  ""This language from Jenrick is more of his usual nasty divisive rhetoric - he is such a tool."" Ms Shah, the MP for Bradford West, called Mr Jenrick's comments ""textbook Islamophobia"". His comments ""literally equates every Muslim in the world with extremism"" she argued.  In a social media post she said: “Imagine in this climate, either being that ignorant or deliberately trying to stigmatise all Muslims. He should apologise and speak to Muslim communities and learn more about our faith.” Afzal Khan, another Labour MP, said: “Another day, another senior Tory being Islamophobic.  ""Allahu Akbar means God is great – the Muslim equivalent of hallelujah. Jenrick’s confidence in going on national TV to say people should be arrested for saying Allahu Akbar exposes his deep-seated prejudice against Muslims.” Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said: “People like Robert Jenrick have been stirring up some of the problems that we’ve seen in our communities.   ""Actually, what we want to see is communities come together, and the vast majority of the community want to see that.” Mr Jenrick stood by his comments in a later social media post. He said: ""Allahu Akbar is spoken peacefully and spiritually by millions of British Muslims in their daily lives”. But “aggressive chanting” of the phrase as seen by gangs of men in balaclavas in Birmingham was “an offence under Section 4 and 5 of the Public Order Act”. A spokesperson for Mr Jenrick said: ""Robert has called out all disorder in the strongest possible terms, whether from the far-right or retaliatory violence from sectarian mobs. ""We are yet to see one Labour politician do the same. The country needs strong leadership, not squeamishness."" But Baroness Warsi accused Mr Jenrick of being dishonest and called on him to apologise. ""You do not get to go on national broadcasters and say one thing and try and pretend you said something else after,"" she said. Mr Jenrick is one of six candidates vying to replace Rishi Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party. He is facing: A winner will be announced on 2 November."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87r7jpl5zlo,IDF failures led to aid workers' deaths - Australia,"The strike on 1 April killed seven charity workers from the World Central Kitchen, including one Australian.",2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:29.797976,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"An Australian government review has found that ""serious failures"" by the Israeli military led to drone strikes on an aid convoy that killed seven workers in Gaza. The strike on 1 April killed charity workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) from Australia, Canada, Poland, the UK and the US, as well as their Palestinian colleague.   The review, released on Friday, concluded that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) failed to follow procedures and made identification and decision-making errors. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the Australian government would ""press for full accountability"" for those responsible for the incident, ""including any appropriate criminal charges"".  ""The military advocate general of Israel is still to decide on further action,"" she said in a statement on Friday. The IDF had launched an internal investigation amid intense international pressure and sacked senior officers after acknowledging that the strike was a ""serious failure"" and a ""grave mistake"".  The charity's team had been authorised by the Israeli military to help transfer aid supplies from the coast to a warehouse. The convoy was hit in the Gazan city of Deir al-Balah when drone operators did not follow rules and thought WCK's cars were carrying Hamas gunmen, the IDF's inquiry said. WCK founder José Andrés had accused Israeli forces of targeting his aid workers ""systematically, car by car"". While WCK recognised at the time that the IDF's admission of failure was an important step forward, it called for an independent investigation into the deadly attack. ""It is also clear from their preliminary investigation that the IDF has deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement,"" WCK said in a statement in April. ""We demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza."" Shortly after the attack, the Australian government appointed former defence force chief Mark Binskin as a special advisor on a review into the WCK workers' deaths. Ms Wong said at the time that Mr Binskin would examine the ""sufficiency and appropriateness of the steps taken by the Israeli government"" in relation to the incident. Following the release of the review on Friday, Ms Wong said the Australian government would implement all of Mr Binskin's recommendations, including calls for Israel to improve coordination with humanitarian organisations working on the ground. The IDF had also said that it had formally reprimanded three commanders for their overall responsibility in the strikes, and that those who carried out the attack could face criminal prosecution. Ms Wong said Israel is still in the process of determining accountability.  ""Our expectation remains that there be transparency about the military advocate general's process and decision,"" she added. More than 250 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, according to the United Nations."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cye0rj48kg5o,St Andrews rector removed from role after Gaza 'genocide' email,Stella Maris was removed as president of the university court following complaints by students.,1 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:29.888328,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"St Andrews University's rector has been removed from her role on the university court in a row over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war. Stella Maris sent an email to all students referring to ""genocidal attacks"" by the Israeli government, shortly after she was elected in October. An investigation found she had ""breached her responsibilities"" to students, but Ms Maris said it set a ""dangerous precedent for freedom of speech"". She will no longer sit as president the university court - its highest governing body - but will remain in a pastoral care role for students. Ms Maris, a former St Andrews student, will retain the title and office of rector until her term expires in October 2026. The university said the decision came after she repeatedly declined to accept the conclusion of an independent investigation into her comments.  It found she had made some students “fear for their safety” and failed in her responsibilities and legal obligations as a court member. But Ms Maris said her removal showed ""a lack of respect"" for the rector's role in speaking independently for students. She added: ""It is clear that I have been removed from court because I called for an end to Israel’s war crimes against Palestinians, and I will not apologise for doing so.  ""As a young, neurodiverse Black woman with limited financial resources, I have faced the full force of the university, including a KC investigation, all because I made a statement supported by the overwhelming majority of students, calling for an end to a genocide."" Chair of the university court Ray Perman, said Ms Maris was in ""serious and persistent breach of her responsibilities"" after emailing all 10,000 St Andrews students with her personal opinions on the Gaza conflict. He added: ""We recognise that parts of the rector’s statement were an important source of comfort to students affected by the conflict in Gaza. “We also wish to stress most explicitly that the rector has never been asked to diminish or change her support of the Palestinian cause, only to acknowledge that in her handling of this matter, she caused distress and fear to some students, whom it was her duty to support and represent."" University principal Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said: ""We can disagree passionately on the most difficult issues, but it should always be with courtesy and respect for those whose views may differ from our own."" Members of the university court are also automatically trustees of the university - a registered charity. Ms Maris also had her trustee status removed. Ms Maris, who previously studied English and philosophy at St Andrews, served in a series of student representation roles before she was elected rector by students in October last year. "

The UN report gathered testimony from men, women and children who had been detained, who said ""they were held in cage-like facilities, stripped naked for prolonged periods, wearing only diapers"". UN  High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said testimony received by his office suggested Israeli authorities may have inflicted ""appalling acts"" on detainees, including ""waterboarding and the release of dogs"". Many have been held without without charge, access to a lawyer, and in ""deplorable conditions,"" the report adds. The report also documents the suffering Israeli hostages say they endured while held by Hamas. Former hostages said they were deprived of adequate food and water in captivity, with some also saying they were beaten. Israeli forces have detained thousands of Palestinians over the course of the war in Gaza - mostly from Gaza but also from the occupied West Bank and Israel itself.  Human rights defenders have raised concerns about the detention facilities some detainees are being held in, with both Israeli whistleblowers and released detainees alleging widespread mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says it has been refused permission to visit facilities where Palestinian prisoners are being held. In July Israeli authorities said they were investigating reports of abuse in detention centres, but gave no details.  Responding to previous allegations, Israel said violence against detainees was “absolutely prohibited” and that it regularly briefed its forces on the conduct required of them. Earlier this week, Israeli military police detained reservists accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian prisoner in the Sde Teiman jail in southern Israel. The US state department has also previously expressed concern about allegations of ill-treatment. But today’s UN report contains the most extensive accounts, from former detainees and families of those detained, of alleged mistreatment.  The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year, when militants from the group killed around 1,200 Israelis and took 251 more hostage.  Israel retaliated with a months-long military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The report suggests thousands of Palestinians have been arrested, some of them medical staff together with their patients, others children sheltering in schools. At least 53 people are believed to have died in detention. Those released told UN human rights investigators of being blindfolded, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burnt with cigarettes.  Some women and men also spoke of sexual and gender-based violence. Mr Türk said the testimonies in the report indicated a ""flagrant violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.""  Detaining people indefinitely, denying them access to lawyers or any contact with their families or humanitarian organisations could, the UN says, amount to the international crime of enforced disappearance. The report is sure to anger Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which insists its troops are upholding international law in Gaza, and has long claimed the UN is biased against Israel.   The UN report calls on all parties to the conflict to ""immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention, including the holding of hostages, as well as torture or other ill-treatment, rape and other forms of gender-based violence, and ensure accountability for serious violations and abuses""."

Late on Wednesday, the Iran-backed group said Fuad Shukr's body had been found in the rubble of a building that was hit on Tuesday. Four other people were killed in the strike, including two children. Earlier, the Israeli military said Shukr had been the target of an ""intelligence-based elimination"". It said the strike was a response to a rocket attack that killed 12 people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, which Israel says the commander helped plan. Hezbollah has denied having any involvement.  Fuad Shukr, who was in his early sixties, is believed to be a key military adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The strike targeted a building in Haret Hreik, a part of the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. It is a fortified, densely populated area. Dahiyeh itself is surrounded by checkpoints. The children killed in the air strike were a 10-year-old boy and a his six-year-old sister. Shukr will be buried on Thursday, the statement said. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati called the attack a ""criminal act"". An Israeli reaction to Saturday's rocket attack on the Golan had been widely expected. The country's security cabinet had authorised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to decide how to retaliate. A retaliation from Hezbollah is now almost certain. In the past, the heavily-armed, Iranian-supported group has responded to the killings of senior members by firing barrages of rockets into Israel.  Shortly before Hezbollah's announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a televised speech acknowledging that ""challenging days lie ahead"". He added: ""Since the strike in Beirut there are threats sounding from all directions. We are prepared for any scenario."" Early on Wednesday, the political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas - which is also backed by Iran - was killed in a attack in the Iranian capital. Israel has not commented, but it has promised to destroy Hamas following the 7 October attack on southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people. Fears of a regional war have led to international calls for all sides to show restraint. There had been regular fighting between Hezbollah and Israel but hostilities have escalated since Hamas' attack on Israel on 7 October. Hezbollah - which supports Hamas - opened up a limited second front in Israel's north, and the two sides have been exchanging fire ever since. And while so far they have stopped short of an all-out war, near daily attacks have left communities in Israel and Lebanon devastated."

The university took legal action against ""persons unknown"" over the ""unauthorised occupational encampment"" on its main site on Gower Street in central London, claiming activists were trespassing on private land. The High Court granted a summary possession order, which decided the case in the university's favour without a full trial.  In a social media post in response to the court’s decision, protest group UCL Stand for Justice said it was ""disheartening"" that the university had chosen to ""smear"" its actions rather than address its concerns ""through open and honest dialogue"". Protesters have alleged some universities are ""complicit"" in the loss of life in Palestine and want them to divest from Israel in response to its military operation in the Gaza Strip. UCL told the High Court that it had spent more than £200,000 on security fees for managing the unauthorised protest camp. The university also argued that the encampment affected its ability to deliver core educational functions. Katharine Holland KC, for UCL, said in written arguments that the aim was to ""protect the claimant's right to possession of its own land and enable it to carry on the activities of the university and prevent disruption to other members of the university's community”. The protest began on 2 May with 12 tents, growing to an encampment that ""at its peak"" involved about 50 people and some 52 tents, Ms Holland said. The university had identified ""escalating incidents and disruption"" allegedly associated with the encampment, with there being ""obvious concern"" about its ability to use its main quad for events such as its student ""welcome week"" in September, the court was told. UCL sought ""an immediate order for possession"" covering its main campus stretching from Gower Street to Gordon Street and Gordon Square and from Gower Place to Torrington Place. Judge Francesca Kaye said the university's decision-making process was ""appropriate"" and that an order covering its whole campus was ""compatible"" with protesters' human rights, and UCL has a right to regain possession of its land.  UCL Stand for Justice said on Instagram that it remained ""open to negotiating in a manner that respects the rights and voices of all students"" and urged the university to ""commit to engaging with us in good faith"". A UCL spokesperson said: “We have a long and proud tradition of upholding the right to freedom of speech and protest, but we must now gain full access to our campus to ensure activities that are so important to the life of the university can go ahead.  ""In particular, we are looking forward welcoming our new students to UCL in a way that equips them to make the very best of their time here.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Charlotte Gerada, leader of the Labour group on Portsmouth City Council, suggested the official link with Valletta to the authority's twinning advisory group. She said there were already ""strong links"" between the two maritime cities. Portsmouth also has an active Maltese community which organises local cultural events. The practice of twinning, or sister cities, was introduced after World War Two to promote diplomacy along with cultural and commercial ties. Ms Gerada, who is of Maltese descent, mentioned that hundreds of Maltese people moved to Portsmouth in the late 1970s for work in the dockyard, including her grandfather. With many Royal Navy personnel either having been posted to Malta or having trained there, Ms Gerada said: “If you have anything to do with the navy or the maritime industry, then Malta is renowned.” She also highlighted further similarities, noting that both cities feature historical fortifications, boast island locations, and have populations that share “enterprising” and “outward-looking” attitudes toward life. The lord mayor, Jason Fazackarley, has agreed to host a flag-raising ceremony on 21 September to celebrate Malta’s Independence Day. Councillors recently met to discuss other twinning proposals, including with Berehomet in Ukraine, two port cities in Turkey, and Jericho in Palestine. Portsmouth is already twinned with Caen in France, Duisburg in Germany, Haifa in Israel, and Sydney in Australia, along with other cities in China, Japan, Bangladesh, and Canada.

The Israeli military says Fuad Shukr was the target of an ""intelligence-based elimination"".  Hezbollah has not yet confirmed his death, but says Shukr was in a building that was hit at the time. Israeli officials say he was responsible for a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday which killed 12 people, mostly children. Hezbollah has denied any involvement in that attack.  In a statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah said the rubble was still being removed from the site of the building in Daniyeh - a stronghold of the armed group which was ""still waiting for the result"".  It said a number of people had been killed in the attack. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned ""blatant Israeli aggression"". He described it as a ""criminal act"" in a ""series of aggressive operations killing civilians in clear and explicit violation of international law."" In a brief post on social media after the attack, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: ""Hezbollah crossed the red line"". An Israeli official has confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Israel gave the US notice of its Beirut strike. Fuad Shukr is believed to be a senior adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, the US has previously said. It has been offering a $5m (3.9m) reward for information about him, alleging he also played a ""central role"" in the 1983 bombing of a US Marines barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 US military personnel. Haret Hreik, the area of Dahiyeh hit by the air strike, is densely populated and strongly fortified. Dahiyeh itself is surrounded by Hezbollah checkpoints. Speaking after the Israeli strike, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that US President Joe Biden believed a wider war between Israel and Hezbollah could be avoided. ""We do not want to see an escalation, we do not want to see an all-out war,"" she said. Earlier in the day, two unnamed Israeli officials told Reuters news agency that while Israel sought to hurt Hezbollah, it did not want to drag Lebanon into all-out war. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) later said there would be no new instructions for Israelis on taking shelter, suggesting they did not anticipate an immediate or significant Hezbollah reaction.  Both sides are aware of the cost of all-out war, which could bring in Iran in support of its Lebanese proxy. An Israeli reaction had been widely expected after the deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, and Israel's security cabinet had authorised Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant to decide how to retaliate. At least 12 people were killed - mostly children - when a rocket hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams on Saturday. Israel has blamed Hezbollah, but the group denies any involvement. It was the deadliest incident near the Israel-Lebanon border since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in October. That escalation came after Hamas' attack on Israel on 7 October. Hezbollah - which supports Hamas - opened up a limited second front in Israel's north, and the two sides have been exchanging fire ever since. Recent days have seen world leaders urge restraint over fears of an all-out war. On Tuesday the UK foreign secretary told UK nationals in Lebanon to leave immediately or risk ""becoming trapped in a warzone"". David Lammy has arrived in Qatar along with Defence Secretary John Healey ""to ""drive forward efforts to bring the conflict in Gaza to an end and to press for de-escalation in the region"", the Foreign Office said. He said escalation and destabilisation were ""in no-one's interests"", adding: “It is absolutely vital that we engage closely with partners like Qatar, who play a key role in mediating the conflict in Gaza, so that we can bring this devastating war to an end."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx285v8djejo,Big rise in antisemitic incidents in UK - charity,"The Jewish securities charity CST recorded 1,978 anti-Jewish hate incidents from January to June 2024.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:36.122543,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK in the first half of this year have reached another record high, according to figures from a Jewish security charity. From January to June 2024, the Community Security Trust (CST) recorded reports of 1,978 anti-Jewish hate incidents, up from 964 in the first half of 2023. The CST says the record high total in the first half of 2024 is a continuation of the impact of antisemitic reactions to the 7 October attack in Israel and the ongoing war. The report relies on figures from incidents that are self-reported. Some 1,037 of the recorded antisemitic incidents were in Greater London, including 411 in Barnet - the local authority home to the biggest Jewish community in the UK.  The CST said a technical problem in March onwards disrupted the flow of reports received from the Metropolitan Police, meaning the actual figure for Greater London would be even higher.  The region with the second highest number of recorded antisemitic incidents was Greater Manchester with 268, followed by West Yorkshire with 115.  Across the UK, the CST recorded 121 incidents of assault in the first six months of the year, an increase of 41% in the same period last year. Cases of damage and desecration to Jewish property rose by 246% from 24 in the first half of 2023 to 83 between January and June 2024. There were 142 incidents of threats in the six months from January to June. This is a rise of 158% from 55 in the same period a year ago. There were 162 cases of antisemitism affecting people and property in education.  This is an increase of 119% from the 74 such incidents reported from January to June 2023. The starkest figure is the rise in anti-Jewish hate involving higher education showing a 465% rise. In the first six months of the year there were 96 antisemitic incidents in which victims were or offenders were students or academics, or which involved student unions or societies. The CST says it is a record half-year spike as there were 17 instances of university-related antisemitism in the first six months of 2023. Mark Gardner, chief executive of the CST, says the figures are unprecedented. “The CST will continue its steadfast protection of our British Jewish communities, driven by our values of Community, Security and Trust,"" he added.  ""CST applauds our community’s ever-increasing determination to stand strong and proud, despite the hatred.” Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the figures as ""truly appalling"". She added: ""There is no place in Britain for this vile hatred and we are absolutely clear that those who push this poison - on the streets or online - must always face the full force of the law."" Conservative shadow home secretary James Cleverly said: ""We must root out antisemitism wherever it occurs.  ""It is up to all of us to stop and reverse the increase in this vile hatred we have seen in the UK since the Hamas terror attack on 7 October. ""It can never be right British Jews could be concerned for their safety on the streets of modern Britain."" In November, then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt promised £7m over the next three years to charities tackling antisemitism in the UK."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce98regp6y1o,Hamas 'in shock' over Haniyeh death,"Widely considered the group's overall leader, Haniyeh had been a prominent member since the late 1980s.",31 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:36.216129,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The leadership of the Palestinian armed group Hamas has been left in ""a state of shock"" by the assassination of its political leader Ismail Haniyeh, top officials have told the BBC. Hamas says Haniyeh, 62, was killed in an Israeli strike early on Wednesday morning in Iran. Widely considered the group's overall leader, he has been a prominent member since the late 1980s.  As head of its political bureau based in Qatar, Haniyeh led Hamas' outreach to regional governments and was central to its alliance with Tehran and its proxy groups across the Middle East.  He has been wanted by Israeli officials for months and the BBC understands that his protection team had recently vetoed a proposed trip to Lebanon amid security fears. But he played little role in Hamas' military operations and as such may have felt free to operate more openly than some of his colleagues - reflected by three trips he has taken to Iran since the 7 October attacks in Israel.  Questions over Haniyeh's succession were already coming into view before his death. Hamas' constitution prevents any political bureau chief serving more than two terms. A new candidate was set to be chosen in 2025.  But his death could now expedite an internal battle between competing wings of the movement.  Haniyeh himself was widely viewed by Arab diplomats as a pragmatic figure compared to others at the top of Hamas - driving the group’s political outreach to regional governments as opposed to the militant options favoured by Mohammed Deif and other leaders. Deif leads the military wing of Hamas. Earlier this month Israel said it had targeted Deif in deadly air strikes on Gaza but there has been no confirmation he was killed. One Hamas official told the BBC: “Hamas is an idea, Hamas is an ideology. And the killing of the leader will not change Hamas, and will not make Hamas surrender or make any more concessions.""  It suggests an attempt by some leaders to dismiss the idea of any tension within the movement.  But in truth, the looming succession process could be lengthy and chaotic - defined by rivalries between those keen to reach a negotiated settlement to the war and extremist elements more closely allied with Iran.  CIA Director Bill Burns said recently that tensions have emerged among some senior Hamas commanders who have been urging the group's leadership to show more flexibility in negotiations and to accept a hostage-ceasefire deal. However, anger over the death of Haniyeh - and the January assassination of his deputy Saleh al-Arouri - likely puts the hardliners in pole position.  In summer 2023, one Hamas official identified Yahya Sinwar and al-Arouri as the two leading candidates to replace Haniyeh. On Wednesday, Hamas officials told the BBC that there were now three likely candidates to put their names forward in the coming days.  The most likely contender is Sinwar. He is the group's head in the Gaza Strip and is believed to be the mastermind behind the 7 October attacks in Israel that killed 1,200 people and sparked the ongoing conflict.  Sinwar is the key decision maker on how Hamas prosecutes the ongoing conflict and is said to be in hiding in Hamas' tunnel network beneath Gaza.  Khaled Meshaal is another possible candidate. He is widely seen a less militant candidate than Sinwar and has previously served as chief of the political bureau. However, he has difficult relations with Iran - now the key ally and supplier of Hamas' military wing.  During the height of the Syrian civil war, Meshaal - then living in Damascus - refused to support the Iranian-backed President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. The failure forced Hamas to relocate their political bureau to Qatar.  The final potential candidate is Zaher Jabareen, who is responsible for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. He could play a key role in ongoing negotiations on prisoner swaps with Israel. Either way, the contest is almost certain to be drawn out.  Under normal circumstances, Hamas' political bureau is chosen by the Shura Council, whose members are elected by local council groups. The body then elects the 15-person political bureau, who choose a leader.  But members of the political bureau are scattered across the Middle East with representatives living in exile in Turkey and Qatar, making it difficult to assemble them at short notice.  Many are also on Israeli wanted lists - which may make some reluctant to travel.  Other questions continue to swirl over Hamas' response to Haniyeh's death.  In 2012, the death of the deputy lead of Hamas' military wing, Ahmed al-Jaabari, saw Hamas respond with missile fire.  So how Hamas responds to Haniyeh's death could indicate how much damage has been done to its military infrastructure after 10 months of war.  One Palestinian official also observed that his death could have a profound impact on the ongoing peace negotiations with Israel.  Haniyeh, as the acceptable face of Hamas to some in the region, was viewed as the most likely person to be able to broker a deal due to his good relations with regional diplomats. "

A rocket strike on a playing field in Israeli-occupied Majdal Shams killed 12 young people on Saturday, sharply escalating fears of a new war in the region. Israel says the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group backed by Iran was behind the attack, though the group has denied this. Speaking in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the estimated 16,000 British people currently in Lebanon should ""leave"" while ""commercial flights are still running"". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer chaired a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday amid tensions in the Middle East. Saturday's attack is deadliest incident on what the de-facto Israel border with Lebanon since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in October. Majdal Shams is one of four towns in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights where about 25,000 members of the Arabic-speaking Druze religious and ethnic group live. Late on Tuesday, at least one explosion hit a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, which is a base for Hezbollah. Israel's army said it had carried out a strike and that it was targeting the Hezbollah commander responsible for the attack on Majdal Shams. Hezbollah is a heavily armed militant and political movement based in Lebanon, Israel's northern neighbour is financed, equipped, and trained by Iran. Mr Lammy said the government ""cannot guarantee we'll be able to evacuate everyone immediately"" if the conflict escalates. He said he was ""working with Foreign Office consular teams to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios"". He added: ""People may be forced to shelter in place and history teaches us that in a crisis like this one, it is far safer to leave while commercial flights are still running rather than running the risk of becoming trapped in a warzone. ""My message, then, to British nationals in Lebanon is therefore quite simple: leave."" Mr Lammy told MPs: ""We have begun the registration scheme that allows UK nationals to register their presence in Lebanon so we know where they are. ""Our estimation is that about 16,000 UK nationals are in the region, but of course asking people to register does enable us to know who is there and, of course, we urge people to leave on the many commercial flights that are available currently from Lebanon, to leave and make their way to Europe and back home."" Conservative Shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell warned of a risk of further escalation the border between Lebanon and Israel - known as the Blue Line. He said: ""We don't want to see a widening of this painful conflict and the opening of a new front would be in nobody's interest.  ""If we're to avoid it, all involved must show restraint."""

According to Iranian media, an air strike hit a building for war veterans in Tehran where Haniyeh was staying at around 02:00 (22:30 GMT).  Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Israel has not commented, but it has promised to destroy Hamas following the 7 October attack on southern Israel which killed 1,200 people. On Wednesday, the Israeli government's press office posted a photo of Haniyeh on social media captioned with the word ""eliminated"", which it has subsequently deleted. According to Hamas, Haniyeh was in Tehran to take part in the inauguration ceremony of the new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was sworn in on Tuesday. His death could now delay efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, as he was a critical interlocutor in the negotiations brokered by Qatar, the US and Egypt. Several countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Russia and Qatar have condemned the attack. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the assassination was ""something we were not aware of or involved in"". Hamas's armed wing said Haniyeh's death would ""take the battle to new dimensions"" and have major repercussions. Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed ""harsh punishment"" against Israel, and has declared three days of national mourning.   Haniyeh’s death comes just hours after Israel claimed it killed the top military commander of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group, also backed by Iran. Israel said it killed Fuad Shukr in an air strike, in retaliation for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights at the weekend. Hezbollah has not yet confirmed that a senior commander was killed by an Israeli attack in Beirut on Tuesday, but has said Shukr was in a building which was targeted. ""Since the incident, the civil defence teams have been working to lift the rubble steadily, but slowly, due to the situation of the destroyed classes, and we are still waiting for the result,"" a statement released by the group on Wednesday said.  Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the country was not seeking to escalate with Hezbollah, but was ""prepared to handle all scenarios"". Haniyeh was a prominent member of Hamas in the late 1980s and was imprisoned by Israel for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising.  He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders. Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections, but he was dismissed a year later after the group ousted Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence. Haniyeh rejected his sacking as ""unconstitutional"", stressing that his government ""would not abandon its national responsibilities towards the Palestinian people"", and continued to rule in Gaza. He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017. In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He had lived in Qatar for the past several years. His official funeral will be held on Thursday in Tehran, with the burial taking place on Friday in Doha, Qatar, according to a senior Hamas official. Following Hamas's attack on 7 October which killed 1,200 people, Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in the Gaza Strip which has killed at least 39,445 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj506dzqmqlo,Relief as Palestinian medical evacuees leave Gaza,One of the patients had been waiting six months to be able to get out of the war-torn territory.,30 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:36.493861,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Injured and critically ill Palestinians are on their way from Gaza to the United Arab Emirates for treatment, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, in the largest single medical evacuation since the war began following the brutal Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October. Later on Tuesday the WHO said 85 sick and severely injured patients from Gaza had been evacuated to Abu Dhabi. The sweeping Israeli military operations that followed have wrecked Gaza’s healthcare system. And the main route for medical evacuees through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut down after the Israeli military took control there in early May. The WHO says so far some 5,000 Gazans have received treatment outside of the territory, but another 10,000 still need to leave. This latest group began to gather on Sunday at pickup points for transport to a central location before departing. In the central city of Deir al-Balah the bus station was crowded with patients and their families. “I call on the whole world to look at us with compassion,” said Shaza Abu Selim, who was pushing her daughter, Lamis, in a wheelchair. The young girl needs major surgery for scoliosis, which has been delayed now by six months. She barely moved, her face stained with tears and exhaustion. “I could not believe it when they contacted me [to say] that my daughter was among those on the list going outside Gaza for treatment,” said her mother. “I do not know when the war will end… and may God make it easy and heal everyone.”  Even before the conflict some Gazans got care outside the territory because the health system wasn’t equipped to deal with complex medical conditions. But Israeli bombardments have closed hospitals, killed doctors, blocked medicines, and overwhelmed remaining facilities with casualties. Nasima al-Ajeel’s story encapsulates the misery and desperation this has caused. “We were struck” she says. “My eldest son was killed, my father was killed, my youngest son, Asser, lost his sight.” Ms al-Ajeel is sitting and holding little Asser, his eyelid closed over an empty socket. Her leg is wrapped in bandages. “His left eye was blown out with a skull fracture,” she said. “My middle son suffers from a leg injury and leg deformities, and I suffer a skull fracture, blindness in my left eye, and a broken shoulder and ribs."" The Israeli army says it has discovered Hamas combatants and infrastructure inside hospitals and health clinics, something the militant Islamist movement, which controlled Gaza before the war, denies.  But human rights activists have accused Israel of obstructing medical evacuations. Physicians for Human Rights in Israel and other groups filed a petition in Israel’s High Court of Justice in early June after the Rafah crossing was closed. Since Israeli forces captured the border area at the start of their ground operation there two months ago, Egypt has refused to reopen the crossing, the only route out of Gaza that does not lead into Israel and previously a main exit point for fleeing civilians and a major channel for aid. Egyptian officials have insisted that the Gazan side of the crossing must be returned to Palestinian control. As a result of the court action, the Israeli government committed to establishing a permanent mechanism for allowing regular medical evacuations. But it has yet to do so, and on Sunday it announced it was cancelling the expected evacuation without saying why. The Kan public broadcaster reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had made the decision himself, following a deadly Hezbollah attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights at the weekend which killed 12 children and teenagers. That seems to have been quickly reversed. Azza Ahmed Kafarneh, a 57-year-old mother and grandmother suffering from cancer, told the BBC that the patients had prepared to go back home on hearing the news, but were told to stay because “there is a big potential that they will agree for you to leave”. In the end the Israelis agreed to transfer the patients through Israel via Gaza's Kerem Shalom crossing and they flew out from an airport near the town of Eilat. ""We hope this paves the way for the establishment of evacuation corridors via all possible routes, including the Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings to Egypt and Jordan, and from there to other countries,” the WHO said in a statement.  “We also call for (medical) evacuations to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be restored.” Nothing is certain in this war, and for those fortunate enough to escape it, the goodbyes are bittersweet. Sarah Marzouk, a 12-year-old girl who says she lost her foot when her neighbour’s house was bombed, was wiping away tears at the bus station on Sunday. “I wish that the war would end and that all children like me would be able to come with me and have artificial limbs fitted and receive treatment abroad,” she said. “I also hope that I will return to see my father in peace.” Ms Ahmed Kafarneh said she wouldn’t leave if she didn’t feel so sick. She hasn’t heard of any medical evacuees who’ve returned to Gaza. “I am confused between leaving my family and going out to get treated,” she said. “And things maybe will take a longer time and the war maybe will take a long time and things might get worse. Nobody knows.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e1ygx7r1o,Biden burnishes his legacy with historic prisoner swap,The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:36.586624,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Last month, President Joe Biden said that he had “no higher priority” than gaining the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. On Thursday night, after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, arm-twisting and manoeuvring, Mr Biden and his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, exchanged hugs with the two men as they set foot at last on American soil. For Mr Biden, it was a valedictory turn in the final months of his presidency. For Ms Harris - the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee - it was a chance to share the limelight of a foreign policy success. In one particularly powerful moment, Mr Biden removed the American flag pin he always wears on his suit jacket lapel and put it on Mr Whelan. It was a tangible sign of the task accomplished and a promise fulfilled. The multilateral exchange of 24 prisoners with Russia – the largest such swap since the Cold War – represents a significant feather in the cap of a man who abandoned his re-election bid less than two weeks ago. Like many in the waning days of their White House tenures, Mr Biden has found that foreign policy is one area where a president, even when sidelined from electoral politics, can make a splash. Typically, this focus abroad occurs at the end of a second term, when the incumbent is unburdened by a re-election campaign and domestic attention is on the party's new nominee. Mr Biden's circumstances are unusual. The nearest historical parallel in the modern era is when President Lyndon Baines Johnson stood down his re-election bid because of growing discontent with his handling of the Vietnam War. That war dominated Mr Johnson's final months in office – and represented his political undoing.  Mr Biden, on the other hand, has been able to take a victory lap with this prisoner swap, basking in the joy of families of the released Americans at the White House on Thursday, after more than a month of personal and political turmoil. Mr Biden's month of turmoil, which began with a catastrophic debate performance in late June, culminated in last week's Oval Office address to the nation, where he discussed his decision to drop his re-election campaign. While he conceded that it was time to ""pass the torch"", his speech included a reminder that his presidential term wasn’t over and that his work wasn't done. It came with a heavy serving of foreign policy promises. He said he would bring home detained Americans - which Thursday’s news significantly advanced. He also pledged to continue to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders - which recent congressional funding has guaranteed well into next year. And he said he would work to end the war in Gaza ""and bring peace and security to the Middle East"". On that last item, the news has been trending from bad to worse in recent days. Tensions in the Middle East have been escalating dramatically. Israel was allegedly behind the assassination of a prominent Hamas political leader in Iran on Wednesday.  The chances of a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have grown, as the two sides exchanged attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border. An Israeli strike on Tuesday killed a senior Hezbollah leader, as well as an Iranian military advisor. The US State Department has warned American citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon – reflecting the growing concern of a widening regional conflict. Mr Biden, who once chaired the Senate Foreign Relations committee and oversaw an international portfolio as Barack Obama's vice-president, touted his foreign policy chops as he campaigned for president in 2020. But the Middle East has proven to be a diplomatic graveyard for even the most capable US foreign policy hands. While achieving the kind of lasting ""peace and security"" Mr Biden envisions would become a remarkable accomplishment, it seems as far off now as any point since the war began nearly 10 months ago. While foreign policy successes could bolster Mr Biden's legacy, the president's place in the history books – and, in particular, how he is viewed by his members of his own party – hinges most directly on the fate of his chosen successor. Although Ms Harris was not with the president at the White House on Thursday afternoon, she joined the president in greeting the newly released prisoners as they returned to US soil. The White House also has been quick to credit the vice-president for playing a key role in negotiating details of the complex multilateral prisoner exchange with US allies. A senior Biden administration official told the BBC that Ms Harris' February meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia at the Munich Security Conference were particularly crucial. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential ticket has quickly attempted to minimise any political benefits from the prisoner swap – both by taking credit for it and by questioning its wisdom. During a rally in Arizona, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance said that the exchange was really a reflection of what he said was the increasing likelihood that Donald Trump would win in November. ""There's a real sense that the world leaders are afraid that if Donald Trump comes in, they’re going to have to start behaving again,"" he said. ""The bad guys worry that Donald Trump will be back and the free ride is over.” The former president himself posted a lengthy response on his social media website, questioning Mr Biden’s negotiating strategy and speculating about the details of the exchange. ""We never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps,"" he wrote. ""Our 'negotiators' are always an embarrassment to us!"" The Russian asking price for the release of Mr Gershkovich and Mr Whelan - along with Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and a group of Russian dissidents - was unquestionably high. It included Russian intelligence agents convicted of an assassination and espionage. But the president and his senior staff, in their remarks on Thursday, said the deal was worth it. Mr Biden also took a moment  to tout his foreign policy vision in what could be an implied contrast with the former president's ""America first"", go-it-alone international outlook. ""Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world and friends you can trust, work with and depend upon, especially on matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this,"" he said. ""Our alliances make our people safer."" It was a pointed message from a president whose opportunities to pull the national spotlight his way – and to burnish his legacy – are diminishing as the final days of his presidency tick away."

Olympic organisers had lodged a complaint with police, after a ""banner bearing a political message was displayed"" during a Group D game between Israel and Paraguay on Saturday, a spokesperson said. One fan made ""gestures of an antisemitic nature"", they add. There have been reports of banners and chants during the game that referenced the ongoing war in Gaza. Neither the Paris prosecutor's office or Olympic officials have clarified the specifics behind the case. During the match some supporters could be seen holding a banner reading: ""Genocide Olympics"". French newspaper Le Parisien reported that this same group of fans later ""mimed provocative gestures of an antisemitic nature"", citing a police source. There are also reports that Israel's national anthem was booed by parts of the crowd, with news agency AFP reporting that some Israeli supporters chanted back ""free the hostages"". The match ended in a 4-2 victory for Paraguay. After the game the Olympic organising committee lodged a complaint with police. A Paris 2024 spokesperson said the organisation ""strongly condemns these acts"". ""Paris 2024 is committed to combating all forms of discrimination, which are in every way contrary to the Olympic and Paralympic values. ""We would like to remind everyone that the Games are a time for harmony and tolerance,"" they add. Meanwhile the prosecutors office has said it is also investigating death threats received by three Israeli athletes at the games. The threats were reported by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, and the investigation will be led by the national anti-online hate body. The war in Gaza started when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October last year - killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Since then more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's months-long campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9ejndq4d4o,Banksy's new urban jungle sparks hunt for hidden meaning,Banksy has unveiled a new animal artwork every day in London - but does anyone know what they mean?,10 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.216627,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"What do monkeys, wolves, pelicans, goats, cats and elephants have in common? We’re not at a zoo - these are all animals that Banksy has painted around London this week. Each day, the elusive street artist has unveiled a new artwork in a different location in the capital, posting it on Instagram at 13:00 BST. Banksy, famous for his enigmatic, often powerful artworks, has chosen not to caption his animals online. He also hasn't explained why they're all painted in the same black stencil style. All his agent would tell the BBC was that there was ""no comment on the theme"", adding there ""may or may not"" be more animal paintings to follow. This has left people to speculate about their meaning.  James Peak, presenter of the BBC’s The Banksy Story, thinks the message behind the paintings is less obvious than some of his previous works. ""It’s interesting that the meaning is more hidden than usual,"" he tells the BBC.  ""There’s often a message that is more clear and immediate in his work: maybe this time around he wants us to work it out for ourselves?""   Peak adds that Banksy's animals show his trademark use of negative space, saying he's ""using the built environment as part of the art"", for ""maximum impact from minimum effort"".  Peak also explains that the silhouettes for most of the animals this week are plain black, ""with no adornments or shading"". ""The monkeys look like they’re swinging from the bridge,"" he notes, ""the pelicans are nicking the fish from the fish shop."" Banksy’s work is often political. During Glastonbury, he set out a blow-up boat, filled with dummies in lifejackets, during a set from Bristol-based post-punk band Idles. It was controversial and the then Conservative home secretary James Cleverly called it ""vile"".  Bansky responded, saying: ""The real boat I fund, the MV Louise Michel rescued 17 unaccompanied children from the central Med last night. As punishment the Italian authorities have detained it - which seems vile and unacceptable to me."" But he's kept silent this time around. Fan theories online have ranged from the goat being about the Israel-Gaza war to the animals being compared to far-right rioters across the UK.  Peak also highlights ""other theories that all the animals are maybe threatened or near extinction"". ""The monkeys may be escaping gentrification and further development in the Brick Lane area. The elephants may be isolated and lonely,"" he said. The goat could represent Palestinians losing their footing - or may suggest ""we may be distracted or preoccupied with the ‘Greatest of All Time’ and the Olympics - instead of big global issues"". The Observer's arts correspondent, Vanessa Thorpe, has suggested Banksy is simply hoping the new works ""cheer people with a moment of unexpected amusement"", and demonstrate the ""human capacity for creative play, rather than for destruction and negativity"".  But what do people on the street think? At 08:00 BST on Friday, Brick Lane is relatively quiet - the hum of tourists who usually descend for food, fashion and street art are nowhere to be seen yet. But there are a few who take advantage of the lack of traffic, stopping in the middle of the street to take selfies and photos. The three primates on a railway line have been associated with the three wise monkeys in the Japanese proverb - ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"".  But in Banksy's work, the monkeys are not covering their eyes, ears or mouths. A group of women are excited to see the artwork, and a passerby stops and offers to take their photo together. They tell the BBC they love Banksy because of the mystery surrounding his identity (Banksy’s identity has always remained a secret, though on The Banksy Story, a 2003 interview was unearthed, where the artist confirmed his name was Robbie). ""I love his work because it’s secret, it’s undercover, and it’s always topical – it’s not random,"" Caz says. ""I think it might be in relation to what’s going on in the country at the moment,” says Sally, ""a statement."" About five minutes later, another man stops to take a photo on a professional camera – he says he’s going on a tour of London to catch the artworks which have appeared so far.  A couple of hours later, and it’s slightly busier in Walthamstow, where the fifth Banksy turned up on Friday: two pelicans eating fish, on the side of a chip shop. It wasn’t officially announced on social media until 13:00, but the suspected work had been circulating online. When I arrived there was a small huddle of people, mainly TV reporters and excited locals who were asking each other if the work is real. ""It brings character to the area - I’ve never seen people standing like this before,"" says Hather Ali, one of the people who asked if it was a legitimate Banksy. He lives next door to the fish shop and says he is going to check his CCTV footage from the night before, to see if he can see the secretive artist in action.  Following the first work in Richmond, media outlets published pictures of two men in a cherry picker - a mechanical platform at the end of a hydraulic lifting system.  One, who was masked, is believed to be Banksy.  Marcia McKnight has been living on the street for two decades and can see the artwork from her house. ""I’m in heaven, this is fantastic for my street, for the local neighbourhood,"" she says, adding it’s ""amazing"" for the family-run chippy. ""I’ve lived here 20 years, so I’ve seen the regeneration [of Walthamstow] happening.  ""So it’s actually nice that we’ve got a piece of art, rather than a tower block or block of flats going up,"" she adds. Marcia thinks the artwork comes on the back of the anti-racism gathering in Walthamstow on Wednesday - thousands of people took to the streets chanting, clapping and preaching a message of peace. ""I would suspect [that’s what it’s about], as Walthamstow had one of the biggest anti far-right rallies."" Although many people think the work is related to the UK riots, Peak still thinks it may have an environmental message. Throughout his career, Banksy has created work centred around the environment - in 2002, he did a poster for Greenpeace featuring characters from The Jungle Book.   In 2003, he was responsible for a grim reaper, which was painted on the side of Thekla, a boat and nightclub venue in Bristol.  Or, says Peak, the latest artworks could be more straightforward than all the theories.  ""It may be simply that he loves drawing animals and he’s having a great brat summer in London, proving he can still pop up and deliver something that gets the world talking, before he disappears again into the night."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e4m6m1r4eo,Rocket strike puts Israel and Hezbollah on brink of all-out war,Fears mount that the deadly attack on the occupied Golan Heights could trigger a major conflict.,28 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.313175,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"At the University of Haifa, less than 50km (30 miles) from Israel’s border with Lebanon, they’re taking no chances. The morning after a rocket fell on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers, the university authorities announced that all staff based above the fifth floor in the 30-storey building should work from home. The fear is growing that they’re in the line of fire from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. “In the last war with Hezbollah in 2006, their weapons reached Haifa”, Esther Parpara, a member of staff from the university told me. “This is a dangerous moment. Parents are helping police and guards to patrol kindergartens. I’m avoiding crowded places. We don’t seek war – but Hezbollah want to destroy Israel and the Jewish people, so can we just let them do that without defending ourselves?” Cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon has grown steadily since 8 October, when Hezbollah fired rockets and shells at Israeli sites in solidarity with the Hamas attack on Israel a day earlier. Both groups call for the destruction of the Israeli state. Frequent attacks by Hezbollah have struck northern Israel and the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 war and annexed in 1981. Israel has launched air strikes and missiles into southern Lebanon and beyond, including an overnight wave of attacks apparently in response to the rocket fire on Saturday.  The tit-for-tat strikes since October have killed more than 450 people in Lebanon – around 100 of them civilians – while Israel says 23 civilians and 17 soldiers have been killed. The skirmishes had been relatively contained, suggesting both sides were aiming to avoid a head-on confrontation. But now the question is how far Israel will go in response to Saturday’s tragedy, the biggest single loss of life in the cross-border attacks since October.  Thousands lined the streets of the town to mourn the young victims, holding flowers and photos as they crowded beside the small white coffins. Hezbollah says it did not fire the deadly rocket, but the Israeli government insists that’s a lie. Following the strike, the Lebanese militants are said to have pre-emptively cleared out some key sites in the south of the country and the eastern Bekaa valley in the anticipation of a large-scale Israeli attack. Israel’s prime minister returned early from the US to chair a security cabinet meeting, amid calls to hit back hard. Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that Hezbollah will “pay a heavy price which it has not paid up to now”.  Israel Katz, the foreign minister, said Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, should “pay with his head”, while the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, warned Israel was approaching all-out war with Hezbollah. But Israel knows that the price of such a war with the Lebanese militant group could be devastating – for both sides.  Hezbollah is the strongest non-state actor in the region, with an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles in its arsenal. It is Iran’s most important proxy in the Middle East – and an attack by Israel could draw in Tehran, which warned Israel that any “new adventures” in Lebanon could lead to “unforeseen consequences”.  And Israeli troops are still stretched in Gaza. Opening up another military front as their munitions run low could simply be unfeasible. On the other hand, some 60,000 Israelis have been displaced from the border region with Lebanon over the past few months – and many are demanding that their government neutralise the threat from Hezbollah.  And Mr Netanyahu, whose popularity at home is plummeting, is doing all he can for his political survival. Critics claim he is prolonging the war in Gaza by adding ever more stringent demands on Hamas for a ceasefire deal, knowing that once the fighting stops there, he could face an early election and the end of his career.  The fear is that weakened and under pressure from far-right bellicose ministers, he may now be tempted to expand the fight into Lebanon in part for domestic political aims. This is a perilous moment. And while the international calls for restraint from both sides grow louder, this tinderbox region waits to see if the Golan Heights rocket will spark an inferno."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c29dwgp3rr7o,"Hezbollah, Israel and the Golan Heights: What is happening and why?",A deadly strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights has escalated fears of a new war.,29 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.409266,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A deadly strike on a playing field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights has sharply escalated fears of a new war in the region. Israel says the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group was behind the attack, though the group has denied this. On the evening of Saturday 27 July, a blast hit a playing field in the town of Majdal Shams, killing 12 children and young people from the minority Druze community. It was the deadliest incident in or around Israel's border with Lebanon since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in October. The strike, with its young victims, caused outrage and shock in Israel and around the world.  Israel says Hezbollah carried out the attack with an Iranian-made rocket, fired from a short distance away in Lebanon. The US also says Hezbollah was to blame. Hezbollah has strongly denied involvement. Hezbollah is a heavily armed militant and political movement based in Lebanon - Israel's northern neighbour.  Its military wing is one of the most powerful forces in the region, equipped with up to 200,000 missiles and rockets, as well as attack drones. It is separate to the Lebanese army, and is much stronger. Hezbollah is also politically influential in the Lebanese government.  The movement follows the Shia branch of Islam and is financed, equipped and trained by Iran, the dominant Shia power in the Middle East. Hezbollah and its supporters consider it a legitimate resistance movement against Israel, which it claims still occupies part of Lebanese territory. Hezbollah is a strong supporter of Hamas and the Palestinians and rejects Israel's right to exist. The movement is banned as a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League The Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-west Syria, extending towards north-east Israel.  In the 1967 Middle East war, Israel captured about 1,200 km sq (about 460 square miles) of the Golan Heights, from which Syria had attacked it. Israel annexed the area in 1981, in a move which has not been recognised by the vast majority of the international community. The Trump administration broke with decades of US policy by recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights in 2019.  Syria says the land has always belonged to it and has vowed to recover the territory, while Israel says the heights are crucial for its defence and will remain in its hands forever. About 20,000 Jewish settlers live on the Golan Heights, which is also home to Israeli military bases and listening posts. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Druze people are an Arabic-speaking ethnic and religious group who mostly live in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Syria. Part of the community has lived on the Golan Heights for centuries. Those on the Golan Heights went from Syrian to Israeli rule in June 1967, when Israel occupied most of it. Majdal Shams is the largest of four Druze-majority towns there. Israel offered citizenship to all of the Golan Height's residents, though many chose to retain their allegiance to Syria.  About 20% of the approximately 21,000 Druze who live there today have accepted or inherited Israeli citizenship. Those who have kept Syrian citizenship also have Israeli residency status, with most of the same rights as Israeli nationals apart from the right to vote. Beyond the occupied Golan Heights, there about about 110,000 Druze who are full Israeli citizens. They are the largest non-Jewish community which serves in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), as part of the country's mandatory national service.  There are about a million Druze in the world, though estimates vary. Their faith is an offshoot of a branch of Shia Islam but theirs is a distinct religion with its own set of practices and beliefs. Hezbollah fired at Israeli targets the day after Israel was attacked by Hamas in the south on 7 October. Hezbollah says it is acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Since then, the two sides have exchanged fire on a regular basis, forcing thousands of people in Lebanon and Israel from their homes. Israeli security officials say the rocket which killed the youngsters was part of a barrage which struck several locations on the occupied Golan Heights. That followed an Israeli strike that killed four Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon. Most Hezbollah attacks since 8 October have hit northern Israel, with fewer strikes  on the Golan Heights. It has, though, repeatedly targeted Israeli military positions on part of the Golan Heights called the Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov, just a few miles from Majdal Shams. Hezbollah may have calculated that the international reaction to attacking an area considered to be under Israeli occupation would be relatively muted, while keeping up pressure on the Israeli government and military as they fight a war in Gaza.  Hezbollah supports Hamas, which has been at war with Israel since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  Hezbollah opened up a limited second front in Israel's north the next day and the two sides have been exchanging fire ever since. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran (although Hamas is a Sunni Muslim group and Hezbollah is Shia). Both are part of what Iran calls an ""axis of resistance"", a loose alliance of like-minded, Iran-backed groups across the Middle East, acting against Israel and Israel's key ally, the US, in the region. Hezbollah has not got directly involved in the war in Gaza and has said it will stop firing at Israel if and when there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."

The costs that Mr Netanyahu, his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Israel’s military chiefs decide to inflict on Hezbollah will determine whether the war either side of the Israel-Lebanon border stays limited and relatively controlled or explodes into something much worse. The border war started the day after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October last year, when Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel to support the Palestinians.  Since then, it has been fought within a grisly set of unspoken understandings. Israel and Hezbollah have mostly aimed at military targets, though both have also killed civilians.  As a result, the war, though highly dangerous, has stayed limited. Even so, tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have left their homes. Busy communities have become ghost towns. The fear from the outset has been that a big attack on either side’s civilians would cause uncontrolled escalation and in turn, cause a much worse war, as both Israel and Hezbollah bring their full force to bear.  Action against Hezbollah in the largely depopulated areas of south Lebanon might avoid escalation. Killing Lebanese civilians in Beirut or destroying infrastructure like bridges or power stations would not. Hezbollah claims, unconvincingly, that it did not carry out the attack in Majdal Shams. Even so, it is hard to see why it would target Druze children at a football match.  Hezbollah has mostly stuck to the tacit rules of the conflict, trying to kill soldiers, not civilians since it started the border war on 8 October.  It might have been aiming for the extensive Israeli early warning stations on military positions on Mount Hermon.  Hezbollah is a much more formidable enemy of Israel than Hamas. It is more powerful than the fragile Lebanese state and operates without consulting it.  Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah is close to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Hezbollah fighters are disciplined and well trained, and Iran has supplied them with a formidable arsenal of missiles that can hit Israel’s cities. Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill in their last big war in 2006. Its men have extensive combat experience after fighting for years in Syria in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Israel’s leadership know all that. They also know that despite their vast firepower they have not yet subdued Hamas in Gaza, and the reservists their army relies on are feeling considerable strain.  Israel is also under heavy pressure from its allies, including the US - without which it cannot sustain its war effort - not to take action that would escalate the war into an all-out fight. The Americans and the French have tried to negotiate a way of de-escalating the Israel-Hezbollah border war. The absence of a ceasefire in Gaza blights their chances of success. The border between Israel and Lebanon remains the mostly likely place for the wider Middle East war to intensify.  Even if the crisis caused by the killing of young football players and spectators in Majdal Shams passes without a much worse conflagration, the ""rules"" of the border war are tattered, imperfect, unstable and continue to carry the risk that a single bloody incident will touch off another catastrophic war."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c035r104dg7o,Bella Hadid shocked and upset over Adidas campaign,"An advertising campaign was criticised for ""unintentional"" connections to the 1972 Munich Olympics.",30 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.599344,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"US model Bella Hadid has spoken out after starring in an Adidas campaign which was criticised for what the brand called ""unintentional"" connections to the 1972 Munich Olympics. Hadid, who is half Palestinian, said:  ""I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign."" The advertising campaign for the retro trainers - the SL72s - referenced the 1972 Munich Olympics, which saw 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer killed in the attack by a Palestinian group called Black September. Adidas subsequently apologised and said it would ""revise"" its campaign, confirming to AFP that Hadid had been removed from it. Hadid, 27, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinians and earlier this year donated money to support relief efforts for the war in Gaza. ""I would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind,"" Hadid said in a statement shared on an Instagram story on Monday evening. ""In advance of the campaign release, I had no knowledge of the historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972.""  She continued: ""I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign. Had I been made aware, from the bottom of my heart, I would never have participated. ""My team should have known, Adidas should have known and I should have done more research so that I too would have known and understood, and spoken up."" The campaign released earlier this month saw Hadid holding a floral bouquet for the relaunch of the trainer which originally debuted in 1972,  the same year as the Munich Olympics. Hadid continued: ""While everyone's intentions were to make something positive, and bring people together through art, the collective lack of understanding from all parties undermined the process. ""I do not believe in hate in any form, including antisemitism. That will never waver, and I stand by that statement to the fullest extent. ""Connecting the liberation of the Palestinian people to an attack so tragic, is something that hurts my heart. ""Palestine is not synonymous with terrorism and this campaign unintentionally highlighted an event that does not represent who we are."" Hadid described herself as a ""proud Palestinian woman"". ""I will forever stand by my people of Palestine while continuing to advocate for a world free of antisemitism,"" she continued. ""Antisemitism has no place in the liberation of the Palestinian people. ""I will always stand for peace over violence, any day. Hate has no place here, and I will forever advocate for not only my people, but every person worldwide."" A previous statement from Adidas Originals shared on Instagram said connections to the 1972 attack were ""not meant"". The German company apologised ""for any upset or distress caused to communities around the world"". ""We made an unintentional mistake,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""revising the campaign"". When the ad was launched, it attracted criticism towards Hadid from some quarters, including on social media. But other users defended the model and called for a boycott of Adidas following the move to pull the campaign. The conflict in Gaza began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that more than 39,000 people have been killed in almost 10 months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y49rv174o,Israeli ministers authorise Netanyahu retaliation against Hezbollah,Israel is expected to retaliate after a rocket attack blamed on Hezbollah killed 12 young people.,29 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.699071,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's security cabinet has authorised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister to decide when and how to retaliate for a deadly rocket attack Israel and the US say was carried out by the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah. Ministers met in emergency session in the wake of the strike on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday evening, which killed 12 children and teenagers from the Druze community. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. It was the deadliest cross-border incident in months of exchanges of fire between the two sides. The attack has heightened fears that what has been relatively contained hostilities so far could spiral into all-out war.  Western governments are urging Israel to show restraint in its response. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Israel had a right to respond to Hezbollah after Saturday's strike, but emphasised that nobody ""wants a broader war"". Mr Netanyahu, who cut short a visit to the US following the strike, went to the scene of the attack in the Druze town of Majdal Shams on Monday afternoon. ""These children are our children,"" he said. ""The state of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe."" Scores of local residents protested against the prime minister's visit to the town, an AFP reporter there said. There has been anger against the authorities for not having prevented the strike.  The White House said it had been in ""continuous discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since the horrific attack"" on the playing field in Majdal Shams. It said it was ""also working on a diplomatic solution along the Blue Line [the unofficial frontier between Israel and Lebanon] that will end all attacks once and for all"".  On Monday morning an Israeli drone strike outside the Lebanese town of Shaqra, about 6.5km (four miles) from the Israeli border, killed two people, Lebanon's state media said. Hezbollah announced that the dead men were two of its fighters. Israel has not commented on the report.   Meanwhile Air France has become the latest airline to suspend flights to and from Beirut, as anticipation of Israeli retaliation grows. Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines, and Eurowings have similarly suspended flights. In Majdal Shams, the funerals of the young victims took place on Sunday amid scenes of raw grief. Thousands of people were gathered as the caskets, draped in white, were carried through the town. The attack is the most devastating to hit the Druze community, which has lived on the Golan Heights for centuries. They are part of an Arabic-speaking ethnic and religious group based in Lebanon, Syria, the Golan Heights and northern Israel. Those on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights have been under Israeli governance since Israel captured the area from Syria in the 1967 war, although many have retained their allegiance to Syria. There are about 21,000 who live on the rocky plateau, about 20% of whom have accepted Israeli citizenship. The attack on Majdal Shams has caused outrage across Israel and the Druze community, about 110,000 of whom also live in Israel.  On his return from the US on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu held meetings with defence officials before convening the security cabinet. After the hours-long meeting, the prime minister's office issued a brief statement, saying only that the ""members of the Cabinet authorised the prime minister and the defence minister to decide on the manner and timing of the response against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation"". In a condolence call earlier to the spiritual leader of Israel’s Druze community, Sheikh Muafak Ṭarif, Mr Netanyahu said Hezbollah would ""pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid to this point"". Hezbollah has strongly denied it was behind the attack, reportedly blaming the bloodshed on a failed Israeli interceptor missile.  In a statement on Sunday, the Israeli military Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) knew ""exactly where the rocket was launched from"". Gen Halevi identified it as an Iranian made unguided surface-to-surface Falaq rocket with a 53kg warhead. ""This is a Hezbollah rocket. And whoever launches such a rocket into a built-up area wants to kill civilians, wants to kill children,"" he said. Previously sporadic fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated since Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions a day after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of the Palestinians."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2q07kd3ld6o,Israeli protesters enter army base after soldiers held over Gaza detainee abuse,The Sde Teiman base has been at the centre of reports of serious abuses against Palestinians from Gaza.,30 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.879026,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Warning: this story contains a description of alleged sexual abuse. Israeli far-right protesters broke into an army base in a show of support for soldiers accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian prisoner there.  Large crowds gathered outside the Sde Teiman compound after Israeli military police entered it to detain the reservists, who are now subject to an official investigation.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement strongly condemning the incident and calling for “an immediate calming of passions”.  Protesters also broke into a second military base, where the reservists were taken for questioning, but a police spokeswoman said officers were able to clear it. Sde Teiman, near Beersheba in southern Israel, has for months been at the centre of reports of serious abuses against Gazan detainees. According to local media reports, at least nine Israeli soldiers at the base are accused of abusing the Palestinian detainee, a suspected Hamas fighter who was captured in Gaza.  He is said to have been hospitalised after what Israeli media reports describe as serious sexual abuse and injuries to his anus that left him unable to walk.  The Israeli military said its advocate general had ordered an inquiry “following suspected substantial abuse of a detainee”. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority's (PA) Commission of Detainees Affairs called on the international community to urgently intervene by carrying out an UN-mandated investigation. On Monday dozens of protesters, including far-right MPs from Israel's governing coalition, burst through the base's gate as others tried to scale the fence, chanting “we will not abandon our friends, certainly not for terrorists”.  Some soldiers at the base reportedly used pepper spray against the military police personnel who arrived to detain the reservists.  Israeli military Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said the break-in at Sde Tieman was ""extremely serious and against the law"". ""We are in the midst of a war, and actions of this type endanger the security of the state,"" he said.  ""I strongly condemn the incident, and we are working to restore order at the base."" Demonstrators also entered the Beit Lid military base in central Israel where the accused reservists were taken for questioning. Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said the investigation into the soldiers’ conduct must be allowed to continue, adding “even in times of anger, the law applies to everyone”. However some Israeli politicians have condemned the arrest of the reservists. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, called their detention “nothing less than shameful”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, Israeli authorities have rounded up and held thousands of Palestinians, often without legal representation. The BBC has previously spoken to medical workers at a field hospital set up in Sde Teiman, who alleged that detainees have been blindfolded, permanently shackled to their beds, and made to wear nappies rather than having access to a toilet. Last month, Israel’s Haaretz newspaper published allegations made by a doctor at Sde Teiman that leg amputations had been carried out on two prisoners, because of cuffing injuries. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. Detainees there have told journalists and United Nations officials that they were beaten and attacked. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have denied systematic abuse. Many Gazans detained by Israel’s army are released without charge after interrogation. Amnesty International this month called on Israel to end the indefinite detention of Gaza Palestinians and what it called ""rampant torture"" in its prisons."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72vg87rzd5o,Lebanon fears new phase in Hezbollah-Israel fighting,"Israel has warned Hezbollah will ""pay a heavy price"" following the rocket strike on Golan Heights.",28 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:42.964434,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Since October, the near-daily cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia and political movement in Lebanon, have killed hundreds of people and forced tens of thousands from their homes on both sides, raising fears that the relatively contained violence could escalate into an all-out conflict. Amid the strikes and counter-strikes, however, there have been indications that they were trying to avoid a major confrontation. But miscalculation was always a risk, and Saturday’s attack on the Druze town of Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, could have been that. Israel accuses Hezbollah of carrying out the strike on a football pitch that killed at least 12 people, including children, the deadliest attack in the current hostilities, and has promised to respond.  “Israel will not overlook this murderous attack,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office. “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price which it has not paid up to now.” Hezbollah denies being behind the attack.  Before the scale of the strike became clear, however, the group said it had targeted the Hermon Brigade with an Iranian-made Falaq missile, one of several attacks carried out on that day. The base, on the slopes of Mt Hermon, is about 3km (2miles) from where the explosion happened, raising the possibility that the missile missed its target. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said intelligence information indicated that the attack had been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon, describing the group’s denial as “a lie”.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, too, said “every indication” was that the missile had been fired by Hezbollah, and that the US stood by “Israel’s right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks”. Lebanon, then, is waiting for a possible major Israeli reaction. The strikes by Hezbollah started on 8 October, the day after the deadly Hamas attack on Israel, with the group saying they were in support for Palestinians in Gaza.  So far, more than 450 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, including about 350 Hezbollah fighters and at least 100 civilians. In Israel, 23 civilians and at least 17 soldiers have been killed. In Lebanon, most of the Israeli attacks have hit the south, where villages are destroyed and deserted, and the eastern Bekaa Valey, two areas where Hezbollah operates. An Israeli campaign targeting places that, so far, have been untouched, including parts of the capital Beirut, could lead to a dangerous and unpredictable phase in their fighting. Seen as a significantly more formidable foe than Hamas, Hezbollah has been preparing for another major conflict with Israel since their last one, in 2006, which inflicted heavy damage on both sides.  According to Western estimates, the group has about 150,000 rockets and missiles, which could overwhelm Israel’s sophisticated air defence systems. The arsenal also includes precision guided missiles capable of striking deep into Israeli territory. Israeli authorities have repeatedly described the attacks by the group as unacceptable and are under growing pressure to act to allow the return of displaced residents to northern communities. Military officials have said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which is still carrying out large operations against Hamas in Gaza, is ready to launch an offensive against Hezbollah, although details of what one might involve remain unclear. Hassan Nasrallah, the long-time Hezbollah leader, has repeatedly said the group does not want a full-scale war with Israel, but that it was ready for one. Last month, he said the group had deployed only a fraction of its weapons, and warned Israel that any war would be fought “without constraints or rules”. A major operation against the group could lead to the involvement of other Iranian-backed militias in the region that are part of what Tehran calls the “Axis of Resistance”. Any war would have a devastating impact on both countries, but especially for Lebanon, which has been in a state of permanent crisis for more than half a decade.  The economy has collapsed, with 80% of the population estimated to be in poverty, and political disputes have blocked the election of a president for almost two years. The government has limited influence – if any – over Hezbollah, which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others. But a full-scale war is not inevitable.  Diplomats were trying to avert a major escalation in hostilities, and the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told the BBC the authorities were “asking Hezbollah not to retaliate”. The Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Oren Marmorstein, said the “only way” to prevent a conflict was to implement the United Nations Resolution 1701, approved to end the 2006 war. The text includes the withdrawal of armed groups from southern Lebanon, between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier with Israel, but was never fully applied. Now, Mr Marmorstein said, was the “very last minute” to prevent a war diplomatically."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5rj16ed4lo,Thousands mourn children killed in Golan Heights strike,World leaders scramble to contain the fallout and de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah.,29 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:49.405631,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Thousands of people gathered on Sunday for the funerals of children and young people killed in a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, as world leaders scrambled to contain the attack’s political fallout. Members of the Druze community wept as they carried caskets through Majdal Shams, while some yelled in anger at government ministers there, Israeli media said. The White House, meanwhile, said Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah carried out the attack, which killed 12. Israel has also accused it. Hezbollah denies it was responsible. On Sunday, global leaders condemned the attack and moved to de-escalate tensions amid fears it could spark a war between Israel and Hezbollah. In response to Saturday’s strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory overnight, and Hezbollah struck two Israeli military bases on Sunday. Cross-border fire between the two sides has escalated since Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli sites a day after Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October. The Hamas attack triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of the Palestinians. Saturday’s attack was the deadliest loss of life in and around Israel's northern border since October. The strike hit a football pitch in Majdal Shams, one of four towns in the Golan Heights where about 25,000 members of the Arabic-speaking Druze religious and ethnic group live. Israel’s foreign ministry said 10 of the 12 victims were between the ages of 10 and 16, and has not released the ages of the other two victims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Hezbollah would ""pay a heavy price"", arrived in Israel on Sunday after cutting short his trip to the US. He planned to hold a meeting with his military chiefs to assess the situation and approve operational plans. Hezbollah denied it had anything to do with the strike, but had earlier on Saturday claimed responsibility for four other attacks, including one on a military base around 3km (2 miles) away. At a funeral in Majdal Shams on Sunday, weeping men wearing traditional red-topped white hats carried 10 of the white-covered caskets through packed streets, AFP reported. Women dressed in black abaya robes cried as they laid flowers on the caskets. Some mourners carried large photos of the dead children. Fadi Mahmud, 48, told AFP that it was the first time Majdal Shams had experienced such a loss during the war. ""Our community is very close-knit. These children are like children of everybody in the village,"" he was reported as saying. Anger among the community also boiled over at the funeral, with some directing their rage at Israeli government officials who attended, the Times of Israel reported. “Now you come here? Ten months you didn’t come!” a man wearing a military uniform was reported as shouting at Housing Minister Nir Barkat and Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman. His comments were met with applause. “We’re tired of your promises!” another person reportedly yelled at Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. In a video posted on social media, hecklers surrounded Mr Smotrich, cursing and saying “we don’t want him!”, according to a Times of Israel translation. Israeli media reported that a leader of the Druze community had asked in a letter that government ministers not attend the funeral to avoid turning the tragedy into a “political event”. The Druze are part of an Arabic-speaking ethnic group based in Lebanon, Syria, the Golan Heights and northern Israel. In Israel, they have full citizenship rights and comprise about 1.5% of the population. But most of those in the Golan have retained an allegiance to Syria. They can still study and work in Israel, though only those with citizenship can vote and serve in the army. The vast majority of the international community does not recognise Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights from Syria in 1981. On Sunday, global leaders spoke out against the strike and cautioned against escalation, although they differed on who was responsible. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a post on X that the UK “condemns the strike in Golan Heights that has tragically claimed at least 12 lives” and Hezbollah “must cease their attacks”. “We are deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation and destabilisation,” Secretary Lammy said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington backed Israel's right to defend itself, while adding that ""we also don't want to see the conflict escalate"". Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib told the BBC that he did not think Hezbollah carried out the attack, but added “it could be a mistake by the Israelis or by Hezbollah – I don’t know”.  The Lebanese government condemned the violence and called in a statement for a ceasefire on all fronts."

Protesters, and Brighton Pavilion MP Sian Berry, say Coca-Cola is an unsuitable sponsor for the city's Pride.  Green Party literature posted to Ms Berry’s X account states: ""For several years, Coca-Cola has faced calls to remove its factory from illegally occupied land in Palestine, but has refused to do so."" Coca-Cola said it supports the right to peacefully protest and that it decided the float could not continue due to safety concerns over its staff and other attendees. The drink brand’s float was blocked in Marlborough Place during the parade, meaning the procession was rerouted along Grand Parade. On Friday, Pride issued a statement saying it had received “many” requests for its views on international issues. Organisers said they had already committed to reviewing all sponsors ahead of next year’s event. “This will include an assessment of all our relationships with partners who have regularly sponsored Pride, including Coca-Cola,” the statement read.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo,Golan Heights strike: 'The whole town is mourning',"In the Golan Heights town where a rocket killed 12, mostly children, sirens were not enough to save their lives.",28 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:49.580121,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The scene around the football pitch here in Majdal Shams, where 12 children and young people died on Saturday, is quiet and deeply sombre. There are plenty of people here - local Druze elders in their distinctive red and white turbans and baggy trousers, military officials, visiting government ministers and of course many journalists.  But conversations around the crater where the rocket landed are hushed, respectful. A black flag flies at the spot where the rocket landed last night, gouging a shallow crater in the pitch and blowing out the metal fence around it. There are shrapnel holes everywhere. Wreaths have just been laid. Many people are simply standing by the crater, taking in the scene, lost in thought. In the corner of the pitch, someone has tried to remove the bloodstains on the astroturf, but with only limited success. Outside the fence, bicycles and scooters lie scattered, all blackened from yesterday’s brief but devastating fireball. There’s a bomb shelter metres away, but when the siren sounded last night, the children had mere seconds to respond. They had absolutely no chance. Israel says the rocket was fired from Shebaa, a small village just a short distance away across the western flank of Mt Hermon, which towers over Majdal Shams. Hezbollah disputes Israel’s claim, but around the time the rocket landed here, its media outlets announced that it had fired rockets towards an Israeli military base less than two miles from the football pitch. This is a day of funerals for those who died here, most of them boys and girls between 10 and 16. Grief hangs heavy in the summer heat. A voice is briefly raised, furious and urgent. “How come there’s still a Beirut?” he cries. “We’ve had 10 months of our children living in fear.” There’s a ripple of applause, but opinion here in this Druze minority town is divided on how forcefully Israel should respond. After almost 10 months of simmering conflict, the prospect of an all-out war scares many. When Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s hardline finance minister, arrives, the crowd swells and the sense of anger mounts. He’s accosted by angry locals. Some are demanding a decisive response against Hezbollah. Some accuse the government of abandoning the Golan Heights. Mr Smotrich tries to offer his condolences, even to hug those around him. But it seems not everyone is interested in his sympathy. In the middle of a large adjacent football pitch, 12 empty black chairs commemorate the lost. Fighting back the tears, 26-year-old Ugarit Abu Assad, from nearby Buqata, says she fears a major escalation. “I’m afraid of the consequences of all out war,” she says. “A lot of people are going to die.” Walking around the steep streets of this mountain community, the sense of collective shock and mourning is overwhelming. Small groups of men, women and children, all dressed in black, are moving around silently, from one grieving household to another. Sometimes you catch sight of people hugging or wiping away each other’s tears. Wahim, a teacher who knew many of the young victims, was utterly distraught, unsure whether to try to express his feelings or stay silent. “This is a disaster. How do I even start,” he said, before apologising and dissolving into sobs. Ivan Ebrahim pulled up a picture of his 10-year-old cousin, Milar Shaar, the youngest victim. A boy who loved football and gaming. “He is the greatest kid here. Everybody loved him,” Ivan said. “I don’t know. It’s hard to describe.” “We haven’t slept since yesterday,” Milar’s uncle, Nassar Ebrahim tells me. “The whole town is in mourning.” The people of Majdal Shams are used to the sound of rockets overhead, but Saturday’s attack took them all by surprise. “I don’t think the government needs to respond,” Nassar says. “They need to end the war, so no-one dies on either side.” The mood up here, away from the occasional angry outbursts down at the football pitch, is extremely subdued. But this is a part of the world where hospitality runs deep. A group of young men call us over, offering water thimbles of strong coffee. They’re determined to stay put, despite the danger. “We Druze don’t leave our homes,” one tells me, echoing a quiet defiance we encounter elsewhere. When it comes to what happens next, they’re unanimous: they don’t want a wider war. “The children here, the children in Lebanon, the children in Gaza. They don’t need more war,” another says."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx288w21y48o,Harris and Walz hold first rally together as new Democratic ticket,"At a raucous event in Pennsylvania, the pair attack their Republican opponents and vow to win the crucial swing state.",7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:49.689646,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Tim Walz touted his rural roots and said Donald Trump would take the US ""backwards"" as he appeared for the first time as Kamala Harris’s running mate at a raucous Democratic Party rally. At the event in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, the party’s new nominee for vice-president said their Republican rivals in November's election were ""weird as hell"". The Minnesota governor spoke in front of thousands of supporters just hours after he was announced as Ms Harris’s pick for the role. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, was quick to attack Mr Walz as a ""dangerously liberal extremist"". The 60-year-old is billed as someone who could win back rural and working-class voters who have gravitated to Donald Trump in crucial midwestern states. At the rally in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, Ms Harris, currently the US vice-president, said she and Mr Walz were the ""underdogs"" in what is expected to be a close election but had the momentum. She introduced her running mate as “a fighter for the middle class, a patriot”. Mr Walz then recounted his small-town roots in Nebraska and his career as a national guardsman and teacher, before attempting to draw a contrast with Trump. ""He doesn’t know the first thing about service - because he's too busy serving himself,"" said the former army sergeant and football coach. He got some of the loudest cheers of the night when he took aim at the former president's criminal record, with chants of “lock him up” from those in the arena. He also sparked applause when he invoked a viral attack line that caught the eye of the Harris campaign as she considered who would be her running mate. ""These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell,"" Mr Walz said of their Republican challengers.  The pair mostly pitched themselves as defenders of individual freedoms, including on abortion rights and safety from gun violence. Mr Walz showed the plain-spoken, folksy style that has won praise from Democrats, as he took a jab at Republicans on the issue of abortion access. “Mind your own damn business!"" he said, drawing an ovation from the crowd of more than 10,000 at Temple University. Ms Harris and Mr Walz have just launched a five-day tour of key battleground states. They will also speak at the Democratic National Convention, which runs from 19 to 22 August in Chicago. As the current two-term governor of Minnesota, Mr Walz has overseen one of the most productive legislative periods in state history, implementing a sweeping left-wing agenda. Democrats have used control of the state legislature to guarantee abortion rights, pass gun control measures and institute paid family leave. A source close to the Harris VP selection process told CBS News that his list of accomplishments for working families matched what Harris wants to do nationally. But Republicans have criticised Mr Walz for Minnesota's mask mandate and a shutdown of businesses and schools during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as his delay in deploying the National Guard to deal with rioting after George Floyd's murder in 2020. Trump called into Fox and Friends on Fox News on Wednesday and said he ""never thought"" Ms Harris would choose Mr Walz as her running mate - who he dubbed as ""very, very liberal"".  H said he is ""thrilled"" about the decision, suggesting it would be easy to go after his political record.  ""You know, nobody knew how radical left she was, but he's a smarter version of her,"" he said, comparing the Minnesota governor to Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator. Also in Philadelphia earlier on Tuesday was Mr Vance, Trump’s running mate, who assailed the new Democratic White House ticket. The Ohio senator told reporters that Ms Harris’s choice of Mr Walz shows that ""when given the opportunity she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party"". President Joe Biden, who suspended his own election campaign last month and endorsed Ms Harris, said in a statement that the Democratic ticket ""will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy"". Another of the finalists to be Ms Harris’s running mate, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, was also at the rally. He had faced sharp criticism from the left over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. Some Trump advisers have expressed relief that Ms Harris did not pick Mr Shapiro because of concerns he could help deliver the pivotal state of Pennsylvania. On Wednesday on Fox, Trump suggested that not picking Mr Shapiro was ""very insulting to Jewish people"".  Before entering the governor's office, Mr Walz represented a Republican-leaning district in the US Congress for 12 years. He won that seat in 2006 - the only Democrat to have done so in the mostly rural district over the past three decades. Mr Walz is a native of Nebraska and the son of a school administrator and a stay-at-home mother. He grew up farming and hunting and served in the Army National Guard for 24 years after joining aged 17. The young Mr Walz also taught secondary school pupils - first for a year in China, a country he says he has visited about 30 times. He speaks some Mandarin. His wife, Gwen Whipple, a fellow teacher, drew him to her native Minnesota, where he taught social studies and geography and coached American football.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c29dydz84ngo,Israel hits Hezbollah targets after football pitch strike kills 12 young people,"The deadly strike, which killed children, raises fears of all-out war between Israel and the Lebanon-based group.",28 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:49.888744,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel says it has hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanon after 12 children and young adults were killed in a rocket strike while playing football in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The country's air force has blamed the Iran-backed militant group for Saturday's strike on the Druze town of Majdal Shams, but Hezbollah has strongly denied any involvement. Early on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had conducted air strikes against seven Hezbollah targets ""deep inside Lebanese territory"". It is unclear whether there were any casualties. The rising tensions have the potential to trigger an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. Their forces have regularly exchanged fire since 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, triggering Israel's military offensive on Gaza. Saturday's bloodshed at the town's football pitch was the deadliest loss of life in and around Israel's northern border since October.  Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which had previously been sporadic, escalated when the militant group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attack, in solidarity with Palestinians.  Israel's foreign ministry released the identities of 10 children killed in Saturday's strike, saying they were aged between 10 and 16.  An eleventh person was named but no age was given. Details of the twelfth casualty were not confirmed. Verified video shows crowds of people on a football pitch and stretchers being rushed to ambulances.  Majdal Shams is one of four towns in the Golan Heights, where about 25,000 members of the Arabic-speaking Druze religious and ethnic group live. On Sunday, thousands of people gathered in the town for the funerals of those killed.  Hezbollah spokesman Mohamad Afif denied responsibility for Saturday's strike in the Golan Heights.  However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation immediately after it happened, saying the group would ""pay a heavy price"".  Hours later, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) said it had struck ""terror targets"" including ""weapons caches and terrorist infrastructure"" overnight.  Before reports of the strike's impact emerged, Hezbollah had claimed responsibility for four other attacks.  One was on a nearby military compound on the slopes of Mount Hermon, which lies on the border between the Golan Heights and Lebanon.  The base is around 3km (2 miles) from the football pitch.  IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari, who visited the scene of the air strike, accused Hezbollah of ""lying and denying responsibility for the incident"".  He said that the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1 ""owned exclusively by Hezbollah"". ""Our intelligence is clear,"" he said. ""Hezbollah is responsible for the murder of innocent children."" Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the leader of the Druze community in the area, said the ""horrific massacre"" had crossed ""every possible red line"".  Meanwhile, Iran warned Israel that any new military ""adventures"" in Lebanon could lead to ""unforeseen consequences"", said Nasser Kanani, a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry, according to AFP.  The air strike prompted Mr Netanyahu, who was visiting the United States, to return home early. His plane landed in Israel on Sunday.  International leaders condemned the strike and cautioned against escalation, but differed on who was responsible.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Sunday: ""Every indication is that indeed the rocket was from Hezbollah."" He said the US stands by ""Israel's right to defend"" itself, but does not want to see the conflict spreading.  Lebanon's government also issued a rare statement in response to the strike, saying it ""condemns all acts of violence and aggression against all civilians and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts"".  ""Targeting civilians is a flagrant violation of international law and goes against the principles of humanity,"" the statement added.  The Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib told the BBC that he did not think Hezbollah carried out the attack. “I don’t think Hezbollah would do it”, he said, explaining the group usually hits military targets, not civilian targets. But he added “it could be a mistake by the Israelis or by Hezbollah – I don’t know”. ""We are talking with Hezbollah because the victims are Druze and the Druze community here [in Lebanon] cares about them a lot. We are asking Hezbollah not to retaliate at this present time”, Mr Bouhabib said.  A United Nations statement said ""maximum restraint"" was crucial from all parties as the risk of a wider conflict would ""engulf the entire region in a catastrophe beyond belief"". In Majdal Shams on Sunday, where bloodstains remained on the astroturf pitch, locals expressed grief, anger and worry.  Fighting back tears, Ugarit Abu Assad, 26, from nearby Buqata, told the BBC she feared a major escalation. “I’m afraid of the consequences of all out war,” she said, adding that ""a lot of people"" could die.  Most Druze live in northern Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. In Israel, they have full citizenship rights and comprise about 1.5% of the population. Those living in the Golan were offered Israeli citizenship when the region was annexed from Syria in 1981, but not everyone accepted. Druze in the Golan can still study and work in Israel, though only those with citizenship can vote. Male Israeli Druze are required to serve in the army. They are the largest non-Jewish group in the IDF. The vast majority of the international community does not recognise Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5xn9enj45o,Iran reels after Hamas leader assassinated in heart of Tehran,Iran says it will avenge the killing of Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh - but what will that mean in practice?,31 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:50.002145,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The killing of Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran represents a major escalation in the tensions between Iran and Israel. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has blamed Israel for the air strike, and said the killing required “a harsh punishment”.  He added that it was Iran's ""duty to avenge his blood"". The country's new president Masoud Pezeshkian echoed this sentiment, saying: “We will make the occupying terrorist regime regret its action.” Israel has yet to respond but has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders following the 7 October attack launched by the group. Iran has confirmed Mr Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed at a guest house in northern Tehran at 02:00 local time by a missile fired from beyond Iran’s borders.  The immediate concern now is Iran’s response - what shape it might take and whether it would inflame tensions in the region, which are already at an all-time high. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Iran's mission to the UN said the response to the strike would be comprised of ""special operations"", which would be ""harder and intended to instil deep regret to the perpetrator"". In April, Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in reaction to the killing of seven of its officers - including a top commander of its Quds Force - in the Syrian capital Damascus. The action was unprecedented in its scope and seriousness, although Israel - together with the US and a number of regional and international partners - managed to destroy almost all the Iranian missiles and drones. It’s thought Iran could now unleash an attack of a similar kind on Israel. Tehran  could also ask its proxy militias in the region to step up their attacks. Lebanon's Hezbollah already has a reason of its own to escalate its cross-border missile war with Israel. The assassination of Mr Haniyeh came only a few hours after the killing of one of the group's own senior military commanders in southern Beirut.   Already there are commentators in the region who believe the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah could themselves spark a full-scale war. The strike happened on a significant day for Iran's leaders. Mr Haniyeh was in the Iranian capital to take part in the swearing-in of newly elected president Masoud Pezeshkian. He was among invited guests at the inauguration ceremony, alongside the leaders of some of Tehran's key allies. The leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, Hezbollah's second-in-command, and a leader from Yemen’s Houthi group were all also front row guests at the ceremony. All received a warm welcome from Ayatollah Khamenei. In his statement on Haniyeh's death, Iran's supreme leader said Israel had ""martyred our dear guest in our house"". Mr Pezeshkian has reacted to the killing on X, saying that while yesterday he was raising his hand in parliament, today he has to shoulder Mr Haniyeh’s coffin. The new Iranian president is viewed as a relatively moderate figure, who has spoken previously about mending relations with the West through dialogue, and putting Iran back on the map as a responsible member of the international community. However, Mr Pezeshkian will be under pressure to take a hard line on Israel and to  support Iran’s proxy militias in the region.  But ultimately, it is the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guard that will decide on regional policies and Iran's response. Reports from Tehran say the country’s national security council has held an emergency meeting at Ayatollah Khamenei's residence. What has been decided has not been made public, but the shape and timing of Iran's response are the questions most likely to have been discussed. Iran may decide to move quickly, given that the targeted killing is a major loss of face for Tehran. Does this make all-out war in the region more likely? It is difficult to say. Nobody appears to want such an outcome at the moment, but wars are not always the result of calculated risks."

The letter said ""208 BBC staff, contractors, suppliers and contributors from across the television and film industries, the majority of whom are Jewish"" were in ""anguish and disbelief"" that complaints about coverage and social media posts during the Israel-Gaza war had not been dealt with. A BBC spokesperson said it stood ""united against any form of abuse, prejudice or intolerance"", and had ""well-established and robust processes in place to handle any concerns or complaints"".  The letter referred to documents sent to BBC chairman Samir Shah, in which the group claimed there had been multiple breaches of the broadcaster's social media guidelines. Former BBC One controller and now Telegraph columnist Danny Cohen, and former ITV executive Claudia Rosencrantz, were among the signatories.  The letter said: ""We are members of the wider British Jewish community and can vouch with certainty that there is a loss of faith in the BBC within our community and a widespread opinion that, when it comes to racism and discrimination at the BBC, 'Jews don't count'. ""By contrast, we are certain that were similar incidents to occur at the expense of any other minority, the BBC would show zero tolerance."" It added that the corporation should be ""worried they might have a serious, institutional racism problem"". The signatories requested an urgent formal investigation by the board into the problems, ""alongside senior management's demonstrable failure to properly address the issue"". The letter cited posts from Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, a previous The Apprentice contestant, and BBC Arabic staff. Last year, Lineker was criticised for retweeting a post by a Palestinian campaign group calling for international sports governing bodies to ""take an urgent stance on Israel’s grave violations of human rights"". Lineker deleted the post from his feed, and the Guardian newspaper quoted a source as saying he had ""misread"" it. The BBC's social media guidelines were updated last year to say presenters of flagship shows had a ""particular responsibility to help to balance commitments to both freedom of expression and impartiality"". That change came after Lineker was taken off air in the wake of controversy when he compared the language used to launch the previous government's asylum seeker policy with 1930s Germany. The Apprentice contestant Asif Munaf received ""specialist training"" from the broadcaster over his social media posts, which he apologised for in March.  The same month, BBC director general Tim Davie told MPs some tweets by BBC Arabic staff were ""unacceptable"", and maintained that the broadcaster was ""acting fairly and judiciously"". But the letter's signatories claimed ""many Jewish staff have felt let down by the BBC"". Former Panorama producer Neil Grant said: ""When Jews tell you they feel antisemitism, don't question it or define it for us. ""Simply, Jews don't count inside the BBC. When we present compelling evidence of the BBC's institutionalised antisemitism, signed by over 200 colleagues, we expect to be listened to and not gaslit especially by the BBC Board who won't even formally discuss our concerns."" The BBC said its chairman had responded to the letter directly. A spokeswoman said: ""It is a great concern to us if anyone does not feel supported at work and we have well-established and robust processes in place to handle any concerns or complaints raised with us confidentially. ""We have highlighted these to the signatories of the letter. As an organisation, we stand united against any form of abuse, prejudice or intolerance. ""Editorially, we are committed to the highest standards of impartiality in our journalism and in a small number of cases where there have been mistakes we have acknowledged this. Where staff conduct has fallen below expectations, we have taken action."""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Telegram that a Hamas command and control centre was embedded inside the Khadija School.  The IDF added that Hamas used the compound as a hiding place to direct and plan attacks and store weapons.  Gaza’s health ministry said footage showed the victims were civilians and most of them were children. The BBC verified a video that shows children among the injured.  Gaza's civil defence service said the school was sheltering displaced people. Hamas said in a statement on Telegram that the report the school was being used for military purposes was ""false"" and ""displaced, sick and wounded people, most of whom were women and children"" were killed. Witness Mustafa Rafati told the BBC the explosion shook his body and he fell from the blow. Afraid, he said he ran inside the school and saw body parts in a ""terrifying scene.""  ""I was shocked,"" he said.  Verified video from the scene shows a chaotic situation, with people running around a compound covered in rubble. Men carry two bloodied children in their arms while a woman hugs another, and a group carries an injured man on a stretcher. A body lies on the ground covered in a blanket.  The IDF said that before the strike it took steps to reduce the risk to civilians ""including the use of appropriate munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence”.  Gaza's health ministry said 53 people had been killed and 189 injured since Saturday morning due to IDF bombing in Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis.  The strike occurred as Israel continues its months-long military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry.  The war started when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell spoke out against the Deir al-Balah strike on X, writing that it occurred ""at the same time an already very fragile population is asked to relocate again and again, with no end in sight"".  ""Ceasefire has to happen now,"" he wrote.  Ceasefire talks, led by the head of the CIA, Bill Burns, are scheduled to begin on Sunday between representatives from Qatar, Egypt and Israel.  The Deir al-Balah strike was reported as the IDF ordered civilians on Saturday morning in southern parts of Khan Younis to evacuate to an ""adjusted humanitarian area"" in al-Mawasi, a region along the coast. The IDF said it was about to “forcefully operate” after reporting “significant” rocket fire towards Israel from southern Khan Younis and “precise intelligence indicating that Hamas has embedded” infrastructure in the humanitarian area. The Israeli military warned civilians that “remaining in this area has become dangerous”. The IDF released maps showing a further reduced humanitarian area in al-Mawasi. The military shrank the zone on Monday when it ordered the evacuation of part of the humanitarian area ahead of an operation against Palestinian fighters who had apparently regrouped there. After the evacuation orders, Gaza's health ministry said at least 70 people were killed by Israeli strikes around Khan Younis. Also on Saturday, in the West Bank, a 17-year-old and a 24-year-old were killed and 22 people were injured in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus as a result of Israeli military action, the Palestinian Authority's ministry of health said. The BBC has contacted the IDF about the reports."

It reports there will be a ban on non-essential consultants. The Times says selling surplus public property was a policy championed by former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne and the paper suggests Rachel Reeves will echo his arguments for austerity. However, a Treasury source tells the Guardian that this is not about a ""return to austerity"", but repairing what they describe as the damage from ""14 years of unfunded promises"". The Financial Times stresses that the Treasury has not rejected speculation that the chancellor's statement is a ""softening up exercise for tax rises in the autumn"".  Writing in the Daily Express, shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt accuses Labour of trying to ""fabricate their own truth"" to justify tax increases. He suggests Ms Reeves has her eyes firmly set on capital gains tax, inheritance tax and even pensions relief. In its editorial, the Daily Mail says that were the government to slash infrastructure projects and increase wealth taxes, it would ""snuff out"" growth ""in a heartbeat"". Both the Daily Mail and the i lead on the threat that GPs could bring ""the NHS to a standstill"" if they vote to take industrial action for the first time in 60 years. The ballot closes at midday. The Daily Mail says if the action goes ahead it is feared up to three million GP appointments could disappear every month. The Daily Mirror says underfunding general practice could lead to a two-tier system where some patients go private. The Department of Health tells the i it is planning for all contingencies. The Guardian and the Times both focus on US efforts to urge Israel to exercise restraint after the rocket attack which killed 12 children and teenagers in the occupied Golan Heights. The Daily Telegraph notes in its leader column that Hezbollah is ""an altogether different challenge to Hamas"". The prospect of a war spreading across the Middle East will alarm foreign governments which, the paper says, have turned a ""blind eye"" to the threat from Hezbollah for too long.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkg525l93lo,UK drops planned Israel arrest warrant challenge,Keir Starmer's spokesperson said the issue was a matter for the International Criminal Court.,26 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:57.476324,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The UK government has dropped plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, the chief prosecutor of the ICC said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The previous Conservative UK government had indicated it planned to make a submission to the court - having questioned the right of the prosecutor to apply for a warrant - but had not done so before the election. Now, a spokesperson for the new Labour government has said it will not be making a submission, saying it is ""a matter for the court"". A spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I think you would note that the courts have already received a number of submissions on either side, so they are well seized of the arguments to make their independent determinations."" In addition to Benjamin Netanyahu, the ICC's chief prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.  Should the ICC proceed with the arrest warrants, the possibility could arise that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant would be asked not to set foot on British soil, to avoid being arrested by the UK authorities. The court has already authorised 70 similar submissions from other countries on the subject and is currently working through them. Prof Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, predicts it will take until the autumn for the court to look at all the submissions and give the prosecutor time to respond if necessary. Asked if the UK's decision would make any difference, he said: “Of course, the fact that a major country such as the UK has decided in the end not to submit is something that the judges will take note of. “But the court still has to undertake the legal analysis regarding the questions that the previous [UK] government wanted to raise.” He says the decision gives an indication of how the UK would react if the ICC were to issue arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant.  “It would be difficult for the UK government, after deferring to the court… to simply shirk off and say I’m not going to implement it.” A key issue at stake is whether the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over Israeli nationals, in circumstances where the Palestinian Authority can not exercise criminal jurisdiction over Israeli nationals under the terms of the Oslo Accords - a peace agreement in 1993.  In 2021, one of three ICC judges ruled the court could not exercise jurisdiction over Israelis, while two others ruled that this could be decided at a later stage.  Ahead of the UK's announcement, media outlets in Israel quoted a senior official as saying such a UK decision not to make a submission would be ""fundamentally wrong"", adding that it “distorts justice and truth, and violates the right of all democracies to fight terrorism"". Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive, welcomed the UK's decision, calling the previous government's plan ""totally misguided"". ""Instead of trying to thwart the ICC's much-needed Palestine investigation, the UK should be backing efforts to bring all perpetrators of war crimes and possible genocide to justice."" The war in Gaza has proved to be politically tricky for Labour, with its stance upsetting many of its traditional supporters, particularly in the Muslim community. In the recent general election, shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth lost his Leicester South seat to a strongly pro-Gaza candidate, while other senior party figures including Wes Streeting and Jess Phillips saw their majorities slashed. Last week the government announced it was restoring funding to Unrwa, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees. The UK had previously halted donations after Israel alleged 12 Unrwa staff were involved in the October 2023 attacks by Hamas.  An internal UN investigation into allegations related to that attack is ongoing. But a separate UN review, published in April, found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims hundreds of Unrwa staff were members of terror groups."

The Israeli prime minister's comments came on Friday during a visit to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, a day after he discussed ceasefire efforts with US President Joe Biden and Ms Harris, the vice-president, in Washington. The Biden administration said Israel and the US were closing ""gaps"" on the issue. Ms Harris, the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate, however, said that she would ""not be silent"" on the ""tragedy"" and the ""suffering"" of Gazan civilians as she called for all parties to reach an agreement. ""It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,"" Ms Harris said. After his meeting with Trump, Mr Netanyahu said that Israel would send negotiators ""probably at the beginning of the week"" to talks in Rome. He said that there was ""some movement"" on ceasefire efforts ""because of the military pressure we exerted"". However, he said that ""I think to the extent that Hamas understands that there's no daylight between Israel and the United States, that it expedites the deal,"" he said. ""And I hope that those [Harris's] comments don't change that."" Hamas invaded southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, and taking 251 people hostage. Many remain in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 39,000 people have been killed in Israel's military response in Gaza.  The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu and several Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. All reject the allegations. The Rome talks are the latest in a series of initiatives to end the war. The US is sending the head of the CIA, Bill Burns, to meet representatives from Qatar, Egypt and Israel. The talks are scheduled to begin on Sunday. They will discuss a deal to end hostilities and return hostages still held in Gaza. Trump said on Friday that he would commit to seeking peace if re-elected, and attacked Ms Harris's comments the day before as ""disrespectful"" to Israel. He said that his own relationship with Mr Netanyahu was ""always good. No president has done what I've done for Israel and we've always had a very good relationship."" Trump's administration upended several longstanding US policies on the Middle East and Israel. It announced plans to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that enraged Palestinians and their allies, who said it endangered the long-held goal of making occupied East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state. The administration also withdrew from an international deal with Iran aimed at halting its nuclear weapons programme - a move backed by Israel but criticised by European states. It developed the ""Abraham accords"", which sought to normalise relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours. And it offered a ""Trump peace plan"" that would have unified Jerusalem as Israel's capital and given it sovereignty over many parts of the occupied West Bank. The proposal was immediately rejected by the Palestinian Authority."

Much of the nation is focused on the need to end the war in Gaza and bring home the hostages held by Hamas.  Instead, the Israeli prime minister delivered a fiery defence of Israel’s military campaign, framing it as a proxy fight against Iran that must be won at all costs. “You placed the truth on the most important stage in the world,” tweeted Aryeh Deri, the head of Shas, which is part of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition government. “His words represent every Israeli who wants to live in security and believes in the righteousness of Israel's fight for existence,” was the reaction of Israel Katz, the foreign minister. “Netanyahu gave an excellent speech,” wrote columnist Shai Peron, who identifies as a religious Zionist, on the Ynet news website. “He didn't give a pass to the world, to academia, to fake wokeness. He clarified to the world this is a war between light and darkness. He reminded everyone that it is ‘us first, you later.’"" It’s the hostages in Gaza who are the first priority for their families and friends.  A former hostage and some family members travelled with Mr Netanyahu and joined the audience in the chamber, but many demonstrated against him in Washington. Thousands of miles away in central Tel Aviv, the families and friends of those held captive gathered to watch the speech, delivered in English, projected onto a screen with Hebrew subtitles. While it was playing, relatives of some who had died in Gaza took to a stage to berate the prime minister with cries of anguish - a jarring contrast to the standing ovations they were seeing in Congress. “I’m again and again shocked because it’s unbelievable the level of absurdity and cynicism and hypocrisy,” said Noa Golan, who was in the crowd.  “It’s surreal being here, [it's] so clear and obvious what needs to be done, and seeing him there. Lying would be a good way to describe it.” Her friend Ruth Bar-Shalom said she hadn’t really expected an announcement of a deal to free the hostages, but she had expected Congress to be “much wiser and to demand answers from him"". “He’s using everyone and everything, including the American Congress which is too ignorant to see the difference between a lie and the truth, between reality and the movie he’s showing them again and again and they believe,"" she said.  ""It’s unbelievable, we’re standing here helpless. We see that, and we cannot believe that this could happen in these days.” Although Mr Netanyahu said Israel was intensely engaged in efforts to free the hostages, he made no mention of the ceasefire agreement under negotiation. He also postponed the departure of the Israeli delegation to the next round of talks in Qatar. Israeli officials said he wanted to first coordinate positions with US President Joe Biden. But the move reinforced a widespread conviction that the prime minister is delaying a deal to appease the ultra-right nationalists in his government. Families of the hostages responded by demanding an urgent meeting with the negotiators, accusing him of deliberately sabotaging their chances of bringing their loved ones home. Mr Netanyahu also made almost no mention of the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Israel’s sweeping military operations. And he angrily dismissed accusations by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) that he was starving Gaza. He said Israel had let half a million tons of food into the Strip, and blamed Hamas for stealing it. The prime minister was “repeating the degrading propaganda and lies that he spread over the past nine months,” Hamas said in response to the speech. “It would have been better to arrest Netanyahu as a war criminal and hand him to the International Criminal Court instead of giving him an opportunity to… cover up the mass killings and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip,” it said in a statement, accusing Washington of giving Mr Netanyahu cover to “escape punishment"". Ahmad Majdalani, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) executive committee, denounced Mr Netanyahu’s description of the Gaza conflict as a civilizational war, “as if destroying the Gaza Strip… was a civilizational matter"". In an interview with Voice of Palestine, he said the applause in Congress for “every word” Mr Netanyahu uttered showed the US was a true partner in the war. “Netanyahu knows how to talk,” wrote Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper, “especially in English, in which his eloquence is infinitely more impressive than that of all his domestic rivals.” He said the prime minister was correct about Hamas atrocities and “inconceivable support for the massacre” on some American campuses. “But there is little weight behind these words as long as the prime minister doesn't take responsibility for the Israeli failure on October 7, is in no hurry to bring the hostages home, and has refused for months to move forward on a detailed practical plan for the 'day after' the war in Gaza.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz475vdd97qo,The Palestinians heading to Paris to represent their people,"A small number of Palestinians are going to take part in the Olympics, despite the ongoing war.",28 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:57.728144,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"As she put in some last practice lengths in Paris last week, Palestinian-American swimmer Valerie Tarazi thought back to her moment of inspiration: watching the legendary Michael Phelps winning eight golds in Beijing in 2008. “That was like my first like, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to be an Olympian’,” she said. Paris is a dream come true, as it is for countless athletes taking to sport’s biggest stage. But after more than nine months of war in Gaza and the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, Tarazi says her participation is also an act of commemoration. “It’s me honouring them,” she said. A child of the huge Palestinian diaspora, Tarazi, who swims in the 200m individual medley next Friday, was born and raised in the US. But she celebrates her connections to one of Gaza’s oldest Christian families. She says four members of her extended family were killed when a church was hit during intense Israeli bombing last December. “It takes a toll on us,” she said of Gaza’s rising death toll, which is now approaching 40,000. “This is our friends, our family, our teammates or national team members,” she said. The International Olympic Committee has recognised the state of Palestine since 1995. Three quarters of UN members also now recognise Palestine, but the US, Britain and the host of this year’s games do not. Despite her punishing training schedule and the sacrifices needed to compete at this level, Tarazi is acutely aware that she is in a uniquely privileged position, offered the chance to carry the flag in the world’s greatest sporting jamboree. “My little bit of pain is absolutely nothing compared to what they have to go through every single day,” she said of her compatriots back home. One of her less fortunate teammates, Tamer Qaoud, is having a hard time keeping his own sporting ambitions alive. His house in Gaza has been destroyed. He and his family have been forced to move twice during the war. They’re now living in a tent in Deir el-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. “My dream was to reach the Olympics,” he told the BBC this week. “Unfortunately, due to the war and circumstances, we couldn’t leave Gaza.” Qaoud, a 1500 metre runner, has already represented his country twice. A year ago, at the Arab Games in Algiers, he wore running spikes for the first time. It was also the first time he’d ever run on anything other than concrete. In September, he joined Tarazi at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, in China. They were still there when war broke out in Gaza in early October. Qaoud says he had to go home. His best time is well outside the Olympic qualifying mark, but any faint chance he might have had of competing in Paris, even on a wild card, quickly vanished. “I wanted to compete with the world's best athletes, like Jakob,” he said, referring to the current men’s 1500 world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen. “I wanted to run alongside him, to feel what it's like to compete with the world's best.” Amid the tents, the dust and the date palms of Deir el-Balah, he still trains, wearing his white Palestinian uniform, watched by small groups of bewildered children. His old training ground, Gaza City’s Yarmouk Stadium, is a waste ground of rubbish and displaced Palestinian families, seeking shelter amid the stands. And his coach, Bilal Abu Samaan, was killed in an Israeli airstrike last December, one of an estimated 182 athletes and sports officials killed since last October, according to the Palestinian Football Association. Qaoud knows his time has not yet come. Unless he can get out of Gaza, he fears it never will. “The war destroyed everything, shattering our dreams,” he said. “I hope to leave Gaza, join a training camp, regain my old strength and come back stronger than before.” Back in the pool in Paris, another Palestinian swimmer, Yazan al-Bawwab, said he was proud to be an ambassador for a place where just playing sport is a challenge. “We don’t have a pool in Palestine,” he said. “We don’t have infrastructure.” Like Tarazi, al-Bawwab was born and raised abroad, but he wears his uniform, and his identity, with fierce pride. “France does not recognise Palestine as a country,” al-Bawwab said defiantly, repeating the sentence for emphasis. “I’m here, raising the flag.”"

Last July, the paper broke an unrelated story alleging that the presenter had paid a young person for sexually explicit images. The Metropolitan Police said they found no evidence of criminal behaviour in relation to those allegations, and that the current case was separate. The Daily Express has a similar front page - ""I'm guilty"". The paper describes Huw Edwards as ""disgraced"" and ""emotionless"", alongside a picture of him surrounded by police and photographers. The Guardian features the same image, and says the 62-year-old faces a prison sentence. The Times says BBC insiders have described Edwards's downfall as ""embarrassing"" and ""a nightmare"". The Daily Mirror calls it a ""catastrophic fall from grace"". ""Who knew about Huw?"" asks the Daily Mail. The paper focuses on the questions being asked of BBC bosses after the former presenter's guilty plea to what it calls ""vile"" child abuse images. The Daily Telegraph also says questions are being asked of the corporation, following reports last week that revealed he'd received a £40,000 pay rise while suspended. ""BBC in turmoil"" says the i's front page. The paper references an urgent meeting between the Culture Secretary, Lisa Nandy, and the BBC director-general, Tim Davie, saying Ms Nandy ""wants answers"". The Metro leads with a plea from the mother of one of the victims of Monday's mass stabbing in Southport. The paper says Jenni Stancombe has called for an end to the rioting that has broken out in the days since the attack. The mother of 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe describes the police as heroes and says her family, and the families of the other victims ""don't need this"". The Daily Mail says a Russian-linked fake news website spread lies about the person behind the stabbing, which fuelled the riots and led to a local mosque being attacked. The paper says the website claimed the attacker was a migrant on an MI6 watchlist. The Guardian leads on rising ""fears of escalation"" in the Middle East, after airstrikes killed Hamas' leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut in the space of 12 hours. Iran - which backs Hezbollah - blamed Israel for the deaths. Israel hasn't commented. The Financial Times shows a man holding a framed photo of Ismail Haniyeh with Palestinian flags in the background. The paper's headline reads ""Iran vows revenge on Israel"". The Daily Telegraph says a fifth of teenagers, aged between 16 and 18, show signs of being addicted to their phone. Researchers at King's College London have found that people suffering from phone addiction were twice as likely to experience depression. The paper features quotes from a senior lecturer from King's institute of psychiatry, who says young people involved in its studies are actively trying to reduce their phone use. The Daily Star warns its readers of what it calls ""holiday chaos"", with around 220 miles worth of roadworks planned on Britain's motorways this summer. The paper says that on the M1 alone, a 10-mile stretch of road near Leeds will be affected. The works form part of a £390m programme to add more places to stop on smart motorways.

Striking a tougher tone than President Joe Biden, Ms Harris said she made clear her ""serious concerns"" about casualties in Gaza, telling Mr Netanyahu how Israel defended itself mattered.  ""It is time for this war to end,"" she said after their face-to-face talks at the White House. Ms Harris also stressed the need for a path to a two-state solution, while calling on Americans to be aware of ""nuance"" on the conflict.  Earlier on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu met Mr Biden, who stepped down from his re-election campaign on Sunday.   Mr Netanyahu's meetings at the White House came a day after he gave a fiery speech to Congress, vowing “total victory” against Hamas, as thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside. The prime minister faces pressure both at home and abroad to bring an end to the Israel-Gaza war, now in its ninth month. Mr Biden's staunch support of Israel has infuriated many left-wing activists, whose support the Democrats may need if they are to win November's presidential election. Given that, there is also considerable interest in the position Ms Harris might take towards Israel should she replace Mr Biden in the White House. After meeting Mr Netanyahu for about 40 minutes, Ms Harris said she had an ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel and its right to defend itself.  She noted the conflict began on 7 October when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies.  Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people. ""Israel has a right to defend itself. And how it does so matters,"" Ms Harris said, expressing concern about the ""dire humanitarian situation"" in Gaza.  ""We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,"" she said.  ""Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war,"" she added. ""Let's bring the hostages home, and let's bring much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.""  Mr Netanyahu is due to meet Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday.  As he met Mr Biden earlier, the prime minister said he had known him for 40 years - and that the US president had known every Israeli premier over the last half a century. ""From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Mr Biden ""on the great issues before us"" over the next several months.  The US president joked that Golda Meir was the first Israeli prime minister that he had met, and that Yitzhak Rabin, a successor, was there as an assistant. At a news briefing, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu had discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach ""compromises"" in peace talks.  While Mr Kirby added that ""gaps remain"" in the US-Israel relationship, it was still ""healthy"". ""By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,"" Mr Kirby said, adding that Mr Biden was ""very comfortable with the relationship he has with the prime minister"".  The US and Israeli leaders also held a closed-door meeting with the families of seven US citizens still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.  Following the meeting, Jonathan Dekel-Chen - whose son Sagui was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October - told reporters that the meeting was ""productive and honest"". He did not provide further details. ""We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,"" he said. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clly7q9l305o,Court allows university to clear Gaza protest camp,The University of Sheffield is given permission to remove the camp outside its students' union.,27 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:33:03.032496,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"A university has been given legal powers to evict a pro-Palestinian encampment from its campus. Activists set up outside the University of Sheffield's students' union in May to protest against what it said was the university's ""complicity"" in the Israel-Gaza war due to its links with arms firms. The university said it had requested protesters to leave on several occasions due to health and safety concerns and the disruption caused to staff and students.  On Friday, a possession order was granted by a judge at Sheffield County Court. The hearing was told the group, called the Sheffield Campus Coalition for Palestine (SCCP), did not have permission for the encampment and had been trespassing. The university said it had allowed the camp to remain ""in the interests of freedom of speech"", but said requests concerning health and safety had ""largely been ignored"". It added that there had also been disruption to university events and damage to  buildings on the site, alongside ""misleading AI-generated audio and footage"". The SCCP said their encampment, which was set up on 1 May, had been a ""place of inspiration, growth, love and safety"" for those ""heartbroken"" by the Israel-Gaza war which followed the Hamas attack on Israel in October. That attack saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 kidnapped and taken hostage in Gaza. Israel subseqently launched air attacks and then a sustained ground offensive. More than 39,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry. The SCCP said since the establishment of the camp on the University of Sheffield campus, it had been a central hub for activism and had hosted protests, sit-ins, workshops, religious observances and community dinners. As part of their protest, the SCCP called on the university to sever its ties with arms manufacturers and to boycott Israeli companies and institutions. The SCCP accused the university of ""prioritising its profits over basic morality"" and said it had not acknowledged its demands or agreed to a meeting.  On Friday, Judge Mark Gargan gave the university the right to regain control of campus land, saying there were no less intrusive measures to clear the camp. He added that there had been no evidence to show the university had been motivated by the protesters' religious beliefs. Following the conclusion of the hearing, a spokesperson for the University of Sheffield said: “The camp has been outside of our Students’ Union building since 1 May and is raising a number of health and safety concerns, as well as causing ongoing disruption to university activities and our community.  ""As a result, we sought to obtain a possession order. This has been granted today (Friday) and requires the protesters to draw the camp to a close.” This is not the first time a court has granted possession orders in relation to protest encampments. Similar cases involved the University of Bristol and the University of Nottingham, as reported by the BBC earlier this month. The SCCP said it was ""disheartened"" by the outcome of the hearing, but said members remained ""steadfast in their commitment to raising awareness and advocating for Palestinian liberation"".  One member said: ""The university’s decision to evict us does not erase the 87 days that we have spent in this space, organising together, eating together and learning from each other.  ""It has made me proud to witness the dedication of the students, staying up night after night, tirelessly organising events on behalf of the SCCP and going out of their way to make the wider community feel welcomed and included."" The university had taken legal action against ""persons unknown"" as it had been unable to identify protesters. The SCCP said the decision by members to not defend themselves in court was reached based on fears that named defendants would face high legal fees and ""potentially severe disciplinary measures"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y9qpjyx8o,Israeli military recovers five hostages' bodies in Gaza,The remains of a teacher and four soldiers were found in an operation in Khan Younis on Wednesday.,25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:33:03.112033,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"The Israeli military says it has recovered the bodies of five Israelis taken back to Gaza as hostages during Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October. The bodies of kindergarten teacher Maya Goren as well as the soldiers Sergeant Major Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sergeant Oren Goldin, Staff Sergeant Tomer Ahimas and Sergeant Kiril Brodski were found in a Hamas tunnel in the southern city of Khan Younis on Wednesday. The military said the tunnel was underneath an area it had previously designated as a humanitarian zone. It also said it had determined that Ms Goren was murdered in captivity, while the soldiers were killed in combat on 7 October and their bodies then abducted. The announcement means 111 of the 251 people taken hostage are still being held in Gaza, including 39 who the military says are presumed dead. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred frequently to the fate of the remaining hostages in his address to the US Congress, but he gave no clue as to whether a deal with Hamas to secure their release in return for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange was close. “As we speak, we’re actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release,” he said. His failure to give more hope to the families and friends of the missing did not go unnoticed. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called the speech “a sham”, adding that Mr Netanyahu “spoke for an hour without saying: ‘There will be a hostage deal.’” Hostages’ relatives who watched the speech on screens set up in what is known as Hostages Square in central Tel Aviv also reacted with anger and dismay. Talya Dancyg, a granddaughter of Alex Dancyg, whose death in captivity was confirmed on Monday, cried: “My grandfather could still be alive with us, he was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting, he was waiting for you to seal the deal!” “Do you realise that you are becoming an accomplice to murder?” shouted Nissan Kalderon, brother of hostage Ofer Kalderon.  “You are killing our families, give up your political ambitions.” Shortly afterwards, the kibbutzim of Nir Oz and Nir Yitzhak announced in separate statements that they had been informed of the recovery of Ms Goren and Sgt Goldin's bodies. On Thursday, a joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency, also known as the Shin Bet, confirmed that commandos had recovered their bodies, along with those of Sgt Katz, Sgt Ahimas and Sgt Brodski, during an operation in the Khan Younis area. “The IDF and ISA will continue to operate, using all intelligence and operational means to fulfil the supreme mission of rescuing all of the hostages,” it added. On Thursday afternoon, the IDF revealed that the hostages’ bodies had been held underneath an area that it had previously designated as a humanitarian zone for Palestinian civilians. “The forces located an underground tunnel shaft, leading to a tunnel approximately 200m in length and 20m deep with several rooms where the hostages were located,” it said. “This is a further example of how Hamas cynically exploited the humanitarian area and used it to hold captive Israelis killed and abducted on 7 October.” On Monday, the IDF ordered the evacuation of eastern neighbourhoods of Khan Younis, saying there had been “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” from them, and told residents to head to the “adjusted” al-Mawasi humanitarian area. The UN estimated that more than 150,000 people had fled the Khan Younis area by Tuesday evening, while the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 80 people had been killed in Israeli air and artillery strikes. At least another six people were reportedly killed on Wednesday. The IDF said its troops were continuing operations against “terrorist infrastructure and operatives” in Khan Younis on Thursday and claimed that they had killed dozens of Palestinian fighters over the past few days. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum praised the recovery of the hostages' bodies as a “crucial and decisive military action that provides their families with important closure and eternal rest for the murdered”. “It is Israel's duty to return all the murdered for honourable burial and all living hostages for rehabilitation. The immediate return of the remaining 115 hostages can only be achieved through a deal!” it said, including among their number another four Israelis who were abducted before 7 October. The forum called on Mr Netanyahu to send Israel’s negotiating team to Qatar “without delay”. The Israeli prime minister’s office had said the negotiators would depart on Thursday, following what it called an in-depth discussion with Mr Netanyahu over the weekend. But on Wednesday, Israeli officials said the team would head to Doha only after Mr Netanyahu had met US President Joe Biden at the White House. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 39,170 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng9ed3gj0o,Netanyahu defends Gaza war as protesters rally outside US Congress,"The Israeli prime minister told US lawmakers: ""Our enemies are your enemies.""",25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:33:03.207783,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu told US lawmakers ""our enemies are your enemies"" in a landmark speech to Congress intended to rally support for the war against Hamas in Gaza, but marked by pro-Palestinian protests inside and outside the Capitol. ""When we fight Iran, we're fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the United States of America,"" Mr Netanyahu said.  ""Our fight is your fight, and our victory will be your victory,"" he added. The Israeli leader received a raucous reception from mostly Republican politicians as he delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress, his fourth. In contrast, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and the former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, criticised the address in a post on X.  ""Benjamin Netanyahu’s presentation in the House Chamber today was by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States,"" she said.  Ms Pelosi did not attend the address, instead meeting with Israelis affected by the 7 October Hamas attack, according to a statement from her office.  She said she hoped the prime minister would spend time working towards a ""ceasefire deal that will bring the hostages home"". Growing political divisions over the war in Gaza were underscored by the dozens of Democratic members of Congress deliberately not present and thousands of protesters on the streets outside. Crowds gathered by a stage on Capitol Hill decked with banners, including one declaring the Israeli leader a ""wanted war criminal,"" a reference to an arrest warrant sought by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Five people were arrested inside the Capitol building for attempting to disrupt Mr Netanyahu's address, according to police. Addressing the protesters, Mr Netanyahu said: ""You have officially become Iran's useful idiots."" In one of many references to Iran, the Israeli prime minister claimed an “axis of terror” threatened the US, Israel and the Arab world, framing it as a “clash of barbarism against civilisations”. The term riffed off what Iran describes as the ""axis of resistance,"" an alliance across the Middle East including the Palestinian armed group Hamas, the Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Houthis, who rule parts of Yemen. He told Congress that Iranian proxy forces had attacked American targets, adding that Iran believes that ""to truly challenge America it must first conquer the Middle East"". ""But in the heart of the Middle East, standing in Iran's way, is one proud pro-American democracy: my country, the state of Israel."" Speaking for over an hour, Mr Netanyahu deflected criticism of Israel and framed the war in Gaza as his country’s battle for survival, in a pitch for further US military aid. He thanked the US for providing Israel with ""generous military assistance"" for decades, adding that in return Israel had provided the US with critical intelligence that had ""saved many lives"". But he called for a process of ""fast-tracking"" US military aid, claiming this could expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader regional war. Quoting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's appeal to the American people during World War Two, he said: ""Give us the tools and we'll finish the job."" Mr Netanyahu did not discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza at length, except to maintain that Israel delivers enough food aid to provide each person with 3,000 calories. If Gaza's residents were not getting food, he said, it was because ""Hamas steals it"". Outlining his vision for the Gaza Strip after the war, he called for ""a demilitarised and deradicalised"" enclave under Israeli military control.  ""Gaza should have a civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel. That's not too much to ask,"" he said. He made no reference to the prospect of an eventual two-state solution, something President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris - who is likely to replace him as the Democratic Party nominee - want. Several standing ovations could not disguise the fact that at least 39 lawmakers  were absent from the address.  Almost all were Democrats, among them influential former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who said it was ""inappropriate"" for Mr Netanyahu to visit. Ms Harris was not in attendance, reportedly due to a scheduling clash.  Throughout the speech, Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American member of Congress, was seen holding a placard in the air, which read ""guilty of genocide"" and ""war criminal"". Conscious that Donald Trump could return to the White House, Benjamin Netanyahu also thanked the former president for moving the American embassy to Jerusalem and for recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, a territory Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The two men will meet in Florida later this week. At home in Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza gathered to condemn the speech as it was broadcast, silently, on to the central area known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. After listening to the national anthem, the crowd dispersed as Mr Netanyahu continued his address on screen.  The audio was muted, but his English speech was shown with subtitles in Hebrew translation. Shortly after the end of the speech, the Israeli army announced it had retrieved the bodies of two hostages, Maya Goren and Oren Goldin, from Gaza.  The news underscored the growing despair many hostage families feel towards the prospect of seeing their loved ones alive again, with months-long negotiations with Hamas on a ceasefire and hostage release deal still not having borne fruit. The prime minister's address to Congress came nine months into Israel's campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 39,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728313zkrjo,McDonald's to 'rethink' prices after sales fall,Sales at the fast food giant slip 1% as cost-conscious customers spend less.,30 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:33:03.293653,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"McDonald's is reconsidering its pricing strategy, after customers cutting back their spending took a bite out of the fast food giant's sales. Outlets open for at least a year saw sales fall 1% over the April-June period compared with a year earlier - the first such decline since the pandemic.  The drop came despite the hamburger chain offering money off deals to try to win back cost-conscious customers and those who have boycotted the chain over the Israel-Gaza war. Boss Chris Kempczinski said the poor results had forced the company into a ""comprehensive rethink"" of pricing.  He told investors that the firm would lean on discounts to try to stop the sales decline Executives pointed to recent promotions, such as a $5 meal in the US and a campaign in the UK in which diners can select three items for £3.  Those are expected to be extended in the coming months and the firm said it was working with franchisees on other ""value"" efforts. Shares in the company rose more than 3% after the update, as Mr Kempczinski said McDonald's had the scale to make the strategy work.  ""We know how to do this. We wrote the playbook on value and we are working with our franchisees to make the necessary adjustments,"" he said.  McDonald's has been facing a backlash from customers after raising prices significantly during the pandemic. Last month, the head of its US operations formally responded to the complaints with an open letter to customers, saying social media was painting an inaccurate picture. He said the average price of a Big Mac in the US, which is now $5.29 (£4.11), was up 21% since 2019 - roughly in line with the pace of inflation - and many items had risen by less. But on the call with investors, Mr Kempczinski conceded the company had work to do to reclaim its reputation for value.  Price increases, made in response to inflation, had ""led consumers to reconsider their buying habits"", Mr Kempczinski admitted. Though some markets have been able to adjust, in others, ""a more comprehensive rethink has been required"", he said.  McDonald's has increased prices on key items faster than its peers, said Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore. ""Consumers are savvy, aware of that,"" she said. ""The $5 meal that they have launched may be starting to change perceptions, but we are not seeing a trend change yet in terms of transactions and that's what they're going to need to see."" McDonald's is the latest corporate giant to warn of slower consumer spending, including in major economies such as China. The company said overall revenue, which includes sales at newly opened stores, was flat year-on-year. Profits slipped 12%.   McDonald's said lower income customers were particularly hurting and the loss of those buyers was not being made up by wealthier households trading down. Demand at its restaurants fell in the US, the company said, while weakness in France and price wars in China also weighed on sales. France is among the countries where the brand has been caught up in boycott calls sparked by Israel's war in Gaza. Other US companies, including Starbucks, have also been affected.  ""Consumers are being more discerning about where, when and what they eat, and I would say we don't expect significant changes in that environment for the next few quarters,"" a McDonald's executive said on the call.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw8y2v76664o,Netanyahu seeks to bolster US support with Congress speech,The address comes as the relationship between Israeli leaders and leading US Democrats has grown tense.,24 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:33:03.378230,Israel War,BBC,Middle East,"Israel's prime minister will address a joint session of the US Congress in a bid to bolster support for his country's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.   Benjamin Netanyahu was invited by the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, whose Republican Party is trying to show unflinching support for Israel. But more than 30 Democratic lawmakers have said they will not attend, including influential former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  Mr Netanyahu arrived in the US on Monday. After addressing Congress on Wednesday, he will meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, then have a separate meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. ""Looking forward to welcoming Bibi Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida,"" Mr Trump said in a post on Truth Social, using a common nickname for the Israeli prime minister.  Mr Netanyahu has said he would ""present the truth about our just war"" during his address to Congress, in what is his first trip to the US since the conflict with Hamas began. Israel's PM faces growing international and domestic pressure over his handling of the war, which started nearly 10 months ago. In May, International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan applied for arrest warrants against Mr Netanyahu, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes. Both Israel and Hamas reacted with outrage to the move. And last week, the International Court of Justice said Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories was ""illegal"" - a conclusion Israel rejected.  Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are also expected to descend on Washington for a ""day of rage"". Speaker Johnson has warned against protests inside the House of Representatives chamber, saying there would be arrests ""if we have to do it"". On Tuesday, about 200 Jewish American peace activists held a protest in the Capitol building complex. Police eventually removed the protesters, who all wore red T-shirts proclaiming ""Not in our name"" and ""Jews say stop arming Israel"". Mr Netanyahu's Washington visit comes as his relationship with the US has grown tense, especially among leading Democrats. President Biden has also grown more critical of Israel as the war continues and the death toll in Gaza climbs. Mr Biden, who dropped out of the presidential election on Sunday, has come under political pressure from his party's left flank to do more to convince Israel to limit its war in Gaza. Vice-President Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, will not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Mr Netanyahu’s address. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers have said they will skip Netanyahu’s speech. Illinois Senator Dick Durban is among them. He said he stood by Israel, but would not stand and cheer its current leader. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, also said he would skip the speech in protest at the ""total war"" waged by Mr Netanyahu's government in the Gaza Strip. ""His policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,” Mr Sanders said in a social media post. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen said: “It sends a terrible message to bring him here now to address a joint session of Congress."" Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was “extremely worried” about the possibility of an outbreak of the highly infectious polio virus in Gaza after traces were found in wastewater."

Khan Younis, which is situated in the south of the Gaza Strip, has been the focus of a new Israeli military offensive which it says is aimed at combating “efforts by Hamas to reassemble its forces there"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an evacuation order for eastern parts of Khan Younis on Monday. It also reduced the size of the designated al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, which it claimed was being used by Hamas fighters to carry out  ""terrorist activity and rocket fire"".  At least 80 Palestinians have been killed in the area since the Israeli operation began, according to figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. An official from UNRWA - the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees - told the BBC’s Today programme that an estimated 150,000 people had fled Khan Younis since Monday, when the latest evacuation order was announced. ""Over 80% of the Gaza Strip has been placed under evacuation orders or designated as no-go zones by the Israeli military,"" Louise Wateridge said.  On Tuesday, tanks were seen pushing deep into the Bani Suhaila district, with operations also taking place in the area of Al-Qarara. Some residents attempted to flee to displacement camps in the eastern parts of Khan Younis, whilst others crammed into hospitals to seek refuge. Rabah Abdul Ghafour, 37, a resident of Bani Suhaila, took shelter at Nasser Hospital. “I have been displaced 12 times since 7 October,” he told the BBC. “We lived the hardest night of our lives. The sound of explosions and gunfire did not stop for a moment. It was as if the war had started yesterday.” Rawan Al-Brim, 22, from Al-Qarara, arrived at Nasser Hospital with her husband and mother-in-law on Monday.  “We slept in the outer yard without a mattress or a blanket. My four-month-old daughter was born during the war. My breast milk has dried up and I can’t find any milk to satisfy her hunger. My baby screams from hunger all night,” she said. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it also assessed that 150,000 people had fled Khan Younis by monitoring population movements on the ground. It said that many people were “trapped in the evacuation area,” including “people with reduced mobility and family members supporting them.” “We’re seeing people moving to Deir al-Balah and western Khan Younis. Both of these areas are already extremely overcrowded,” Ms Wateridge told the BBC. “They’ve got limited shelters and limited services available. They can barely accommodate the people who are already in these areas.” In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating ""in the Khan Younis area over the past 24 hours"" and had “eliminated several terrorists” whilst “dismantling terrorist infrastructure”. Israel’s offensive comes as The World Health Organization said it was “extremely worried” about the possibility of an outbreak of the highly infectious polio virus in Gaza after traces were found in wastewater. Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

The message comes after Mr Netanyahu said he would ""present the truth about our just war"", during his first trip outside Israel since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. Ahmad Abuznaid, executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights and a chief organiser, said protesters would ""make the statement that war criminals like Netanyahu are not welcome"" in the United States. Mr Netanyahu was invited by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to give his first address to Congress in nine years. Mr Johnson has warned against protests inside the House chamber, saying there would be arrests ""if we have to do it"". But organisers say the streets will be filled with furious demonstrations. Reem Assil, a member of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, said she was travelling from California to protest against the the deaths of family members and other civilians in the ""mass slaughter"" in Gaza. ""The idea of the man responsible for these atrocities being allowed to come here, channels my rage,"" she said. ""I've lost over 40 members of my family and work through grief every day to remain committed to showing up for my people. This is a huge moment."" The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas invaded Israel on 7 October last year, killed approximately 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 Israelis and foreigners.  The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 39,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the Israeli response. Israel denies accusations of war crimes.  Mr Netanyahu is also due to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Jinan Deena, a Palestinian-American from the Washington area, said she and others were ""gearing up for a day of rage"" against Mr Netanyahu's visit. ""To know [Mr Netanyahu] is going to be sharing air with us in our own city... it's like a slap in the face,"" she said. Another organiser from Michigan, who did not give their name, said ""more people are willing to get arrested this time"" compared to previous protests. More than 300 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested for wrongfully gathering inside and outside of the US Capitol complex in October. An estimated 400,000 gathered in Washington to protest against the war in January. ""All the protests have shown a tone of rage, but this time is definitely different,"" Ayah, an organiser with the Palestinian Youth Movement, told the BBC. ""It is our enemy, our primary enemy, they are inviting into the White House."" Mr Netanyahu faces both international and domestic pressure for his handling of the war. His US trip also follows a ruling by the International Court of Justice that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories was ""illegal"". Israel rejects the ruling. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in May applied for arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu, as well as senior Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed al-Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, alleging war crimes on both sides. Mr Netanyahu condemned the application as ""a complete distortion of reality"" that equated Israel to the ""mass murderers of Hamas"". Hamas, meanwhile, accused the prosecutor of trying to ""equate the victim with the executioner"". Polling by Israel's Channel 12 says that 72% of Israelis think Mr Netanyahu should resign over security lapses on 7 October and the failure to free hostages that still remain in the hands of Hamas.  Mr Netanyahu will also face protests in the US from Israelis. Maya Roman, whose cousin spent 54 days in captivity after being kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, is among those travelling from Israel. She told the BBC that Mr Netanyahu was ""leaving behind"" hostages still in captivity, and ignoring the more pressing issue of a ceasefire deal that would free them. ""By leaving without a signed deal, he makes the hostages and the families feel abandoned,"" she said. Pro-Israel protesters will also be in Washington. Ira Stoll, a Jewish-American who has family in Israel, said he was happy Mr Netanyahu was coming. ""America needs to show it stand with its friends, and Netanyahu is the elected leader of one of our friends,"" Mr Stoll, who is not coming, said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e923ggypjo,Police chief fears Ukraine war link to GPS thefts,Insurance claims for the thefts of GPS units increased by 137% in the year after Russia's invasion.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:43.299170,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A rise in the theft of GPS units from a county's farm vehicles by Eastern European organised crime gangs could be linked to the war in Ukraine, a police and crime commissioner has claimed. Farm equipment theft in the UK has risen since 2022, which was also when Russia invaded Ukraine, Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner Dan Price said. Farmer Andy Shaw told the BBC when his farm was targeted thieves ignored expensive tools but took a GPS unit from one of his tractors. Cheshire Police said there was no direct evidence that the units were being used by Russian forces, but it was ""possible"". Six MPs in Cheshire have now signed an open letter from Mr Price calling on the government and manufacturers to improve security on essential farm equipment. Insurance claims for GPS units in particular increased by 137% in 2023. The units, valued at up to £20,000, are used to guide tractors and combine harvesters to improve accuracy in planting, adding pesticides and fertilizer. A statement from Mr Price's office said organised criminals had been known to target several farms in a single night and then plan later raids to steal replacement GPS units. While police have no direct evidence of the units being used by the Russian military, Mr Price told BBC North West Tonight the rise in thefts since the war was a ""deeply worrying coincidence"". ""My fear is that these units are leaving the country and they are helping the Russian invasion, that is my deep concern and I know others are worried about this,"" he said. Mr Price called for immobilisation technology and forensic marking on new GPS equipment. Supt Andy Huddleston, head of the National Rural Crime Unit, said: ""In relation to theft of GPS guidance units there is evidence this is being done by eastern European organised crime units, but there is no direct evidence to show that they're being used in military application."" Arable and potato farmer Mr Shaw, from Aston Grange Farm in Runcorn, said the thefts had a financial impact beyond the loss of the GPS unit. ""It was a really busy part of the season when we should've been out spraying,"" he said. ""Everything got delayed and that has another financial knock-on effect."" Mr Shaw, whose farm has been burgled three times in 10 years, said a valuable battery powered angle grinder had been in plain view of the thieves during the latest incident, but was ignored. ""You just knew they weren't after any old thing, it was just the GPS they wanted,"" he said. Insurance firm NFU Mutual said the cost of rural crime across the UK rose to £52.8m in 2023 - up from £50.6m the previous year. Cheshire Police recently made three arrests in connection with GPS thefts but described tackling the gangs as a complex problem. Sgt Rob Simpson told the BBC: ""We've been learning how to understand the crime, who is carrying out the crime - I'm not saying we've got it perfect but we are on the right path now to how we can combat this."" The intervention from the police and crime commissioner and MPs calls on the government to strengthen the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Bill to include GPS devices. The Home Office said in a statement it was introducing ""tougher measures"" to tackle rural crime including strengthened neighbourhood policing and ""stronger laws"" to prevent farm theft and fly tippers. It said: ""New laws will also aim to prevent the theft and re-sale of high-value equipment, particularly for use in an agricultural setting.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e866ypp1zo,The world’s diamond polishing capital feels Ukraine war impact,Wars and recession in key Western markets have left India's diamond industry workers distraught and jobless.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:43.389481,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Nikunj Tank, a worker in the world’s diamond polishing capital Surat in western India, had been desperate since losing his job in May. The unit he worked at for seven years was facing a financial squeeze and closed down, leaving him and over a dozen others unemployed. Tank was the family’s sole breadwinner - he was supporting his parents, wife and daughter and had no savings. ‘‘He couldn’t find a job and unable to bear the loss, he took the extreme step,” said his retired father Jayanti Tank. Tank died by suicide in August. The last few years have been tough for India’s recession-hit diamond industry. Surat, in Gujarat state, processes 90% of the world’s diamonds in over 5,000 units and employs more than 800,000 polishers. The city has 15 big polishing units with an annual turnover of more than $100m (£75m). India’s exports of cut and polished stones fell from $23bn in 2022 to $16bn in 2023 and are expected to drop further to $12bn in 2024. The price of polished diamonds dipped by 5%,s to 27% in 2023, due to lower demand and oversupply, say analysts. Mahesh Virani of Star Gems explained that oversupply occurred because polishing units continued production despite limited demand to keep operations running, ultimately increasing their losses. The state’s Diamond Workers’ Union, a group representing polishers, told BBC Gujarati that more than 30,000 have lost their jobs in the past six months alone due to the downturn. The union says that as per their data collected from victims’ families, police records and news reports, 65 workers have died by suicide in the state over one-and-a-half years due to this slowdown. The BBC could not independently verify this figure. Experts say the Covid-19 lockdown, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza wars, and falling demand in key markets have adversely impacted India’s diamond industry. “The business of polished diamonds has gone down by more than 25-30% due to global recession,” said Vallabh Lakhani, chairman of Kiran Gems, a leading  manufacturer. India imports 30% of its rough diamonds from Russian mines – now under Western sanctions due to the war – and cuts and polishes them, then sells them mostly in Western markets. In March, the European Union and G7 countries imposed a fresh ban on the import of Russian unpolished diamonds, including those processed in India and sold in the West via third countries. After the fresh ban, India publicly raised concerns, with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stating in April that such measures hurt those lower in the supply chain more than Russia, as producers usually find alternative routes. Traders in Surat echo that. ""India is at the low end of the value chain of the diamond industry. The country is highly dependent on the global market, both for raw materials as well as for final sales,"" said exporter Kirti Shah. Additionally, an economic downturn in G7 countries and the UAE and Belgium - India’s key export destinations – has impacted business. The downturn is also attributed to a rise in demand for lab-grown diamonds, a cheaper alternative to natural diamonds, and to the war in Gaza, as the gems form a sizeable chunk of India's trade with Israel. “The diamond sector in Surat is passing through a bad phase,” said Kumar Kanani, a lawmaker from the state's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said the police were investigating the suicide cases attributed to job losses. ""The government is ready to provide all possible help to polishers, traders and businessmen,” he said. But the families of at least nine workers, who recently took their lives, said they had received little help from the government. The majority of layoffs have occurred in small and medium-sized units, which typically hire workers for quality checks of rough diamonds and for polishing and shaping them. But bigger players are impacted too. Last month, Kiran Gems asked its 50,000 employees to go on a 10-day vacation, citing the slowdown as a reason. In July, the Diamond Workers' Union started a helpline which received over 1,600 distress calls from polishers seeking jobs or financial help. But there have been others who couldn’t get help in time. Vaishali Patel, 38, lost her husband Nitin two years back. The polishing unit he worked for had laid off a majority of its staff because of a lack of business. Brokers and traders too are facing the brunt. “We have been sitting idle for days. There is hardly any sale or purchase,” said Dilip Sojitra, one of the 5,000 brokers in Surat who sell diamonds to customers, traders and other brokers. Lab-grown diamonds, once in high demand, have also seen prices drop from $300 to $78 per carat due to overproduction, impacting the market. Surat Diamond Brokers Association president Nandlal Nakrani believes the situation will improve when rough diamond prices decrease and polished diamond prices rise. Despite the slowdown, some hope the industry will recover, as it did after the 2008 Great Recession, which shut hundreds of polishing units and left thousands jobless. Mr Sojitra says he believes the upcoming festival season, including Diwali, Christmas, and New Year, will help boost business momentum. ""This too shall pass,"" he says."

According to regional authorities the Russian shelling happened at around 09:00 (06:00 GMT). That was just as people across Ukraine had stopped to remember their war dead. “Defenders Day” is held annually in honour of the armed forces. The shelling, near a local market and bus stop, was probably from Russian “barrel artillery”, according to the region’s prosecutor’s office. One image, from local media, showed a body lying on the pavement by boxes of fruit. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. Initial reports said seven had died. Doctors were able to save one person who had initially been “considered dead”. Kherson was occupied by Russian troops shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and was liberated by Ukraine in November. It still lies extremely close to the frontline with fierce fighting on the other side of the Dnipro River. It was at 08:55 on Tuesday that people in Kyiv and throughout Ukraine observed a10-minute silence for Defenders Day. A small crowd had gathered at a memorial site on Maidan Square in Kyiv. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, thousands of Ukrainian flags have been planted here alongside framed pictures of fallen soldiers. Halyna’s 29 year old son, Kostyantyn, was killed fighting in the Kherson region in July 2022. “He was a platoon leader, a junior lieutenant,” Halyna told the BBC, clinging on to a photo of him, holding back tears. “He was a very nice guy. His comrades came recently and told how he fought and how he died. It’s very hard for me.” As the silence began, we watched as cars stopped in the middle of a busy road and people stood solemnly in the streets in a moment that felt charged with emotion, sorrow and intense national pride. Soon, the sound of the Ukrainian national anthem could be heard echoing through the still streets. It was at around that time that the strike on Kherson city took place in southern Ukraine. Separately, 21 people have reportedly been wounded due to Russian glide bombs hitting residential and industrial areas in the city of Zaporizhzhia. On the front line in Ukraine’s east, Russian troops continue to press hard and Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin has said they have almost reached the centre of the town of Vuhledar. Just 107 people are said to remain in the bombed out town with children already evacuated and humanitarian aid “almost impossible” to deliver – according to Filashkin. As part of Defenders Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky paid tribute to those who had been killed in the fighting, saying: “You sacrifice yourselves so that Ukraine does not have to be sacrificed.” Yuliya’s partner, Bogdan, served as an army medic treating people during the devastating siege of Mariupol before he was captured by Russian troops. “I have a daughter, she’s five years old so I think she helps me a lot because she’s my sense now to live. I need to be strong. And I need to be now a mother and a father in one person.” Bogdan was one of dozens who died in the July 2022 explosion at Olenivka prison, which Kyiv believes was a deliberate attempt by Russia to destroy evidence of war crimes although Moscow blamed Ukrainian missiles. For countless Ukrainian families, remembrance is a private act, as well as a public one. Yuliya says she wants to her daughter to remember her father: “What he did for us and everything we have now is because of him. He was protecting us.”"

The three lionesses have been transported 1,300 miles (2,090 km) across three countries to temporary safety in Belgium. Three-year-old Yuna, who has shell shock, arrived at the Big Cat Sanctuary in Smarden on 17 August.  Rori, a male lion who is also in Belgium, will join her when a specially-built enclosure is completed in November. The three lionesses were all collected from the shelter in Kyiv on Wednesday. Vanda, about one year old, was ""kept as a pet in a flat with no access to sunlight, or outside area and was severely malnourished"", according to a sanctuary spokesperson.  The sisters Amani and Lira, who were rescued together, were ""assumed to have been illegally bred for photo exploitation purposes"", they said.  All three will remain in Belgium, with Rori, until their permanent home in Kent is completed.  A spokesperson for the Big Cat Sanctuary said: ""We are continuing to appeal for public support to reach our £500,000 fundraising goal to ensure the lions receive the care and home they deserve."" The sanctuary said it had already received £400,000 in donations.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20mn1z3vm6o,'Our husbands didn't go to war for Ukraine so we can sit around crying',A group of Ukrainian women who have lost their husbands or sons describe seeking solace and closure in therapeutic painting classes.,20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:43.692558,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Maria Ivashchenko’s husband Pavlo volunteered to fight the very same day Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Six months later, he was killed as Ukrainian forces went on a counter-offensive in the region of Kherson – making Maria one of the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have lost loved ones in the war. To cope with her grief, Maria has been attending therapy classes organised by a volunteer group called Alive. True Love Stories. In the sessions, the widows and mothers of fallen fighters express their feelings, and seek solace and closure by painting. They then accompany their paintings with written stories of their love. Maria says that painting helps externalise and process memories and moments that people can be afraid to re-live.  ""There's total trust. No one will judge you, whether you laugh or cry,” she adds. “They understand you unconditionally. There's no need to explain anything.” ""There's a reason why it's called Alive. We came back to life. This project has pulled many of us out of the abyss."" The founder of Alive, Olena Sokalska, says more than 250 women have become involved in her project so far, and there is a waiting list of about 3,000. Olena says that the paintings generally depict scenes that remind the women of the times they spent with their loved ones or of dreams they had. Some paint themselves or their husbands, Olena adds.  “Very often they paint angels, their families or children are depicted as angels,"" she says. ""These paintings mark the end of the life they had and the beginning of a new life."" In addition to the trauma of bereavement, the dangers and insecurities of war have affected millions of Ukrainians. Anna Stativka, a Ukrainian psychotherapist, explains that when wars start people lose safety and stability – basic human needs. “When these two basic resources are gone very suddenly, this creates a lot of stress.""  In situations where war is sustained, this can also turn chronic, with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, apathy, insomnia, lack of concentration and difficulties with memory. ""You can't stay in this hyper alert state for so long,” Ms Stativka says, adding that this has consequences on people’s mental and physical health. “So this is generally what is happening to Ukrainian society,"" she says. Research and statistics suggest that the share of Ukrainians who are experiencing mental health issues is huge, and it is growing. According to the Ukrainian Health Ministry, the number of patients complaining of mental health problems this year has doubled since 2023, and market research data shows antidepressant sales have jumped by almost 50% since 2021. A study published in the medical journal The Lancet suggests that 54% of Ukrainians (including refugees) have PTSD. Severe anxiety is prevalent among 21%, and high levels of stress among 18%. Another study carried out in 2023 showed that 27% of Ukrainians felt depressed or very sad, up from 20% in 2021, the year before Russia's full-scale invasion. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the majority of Ukraine's population may be experiencing distress caused by war. ""It may have different symptoms. Some feel sadness, some feel anxiety, some have difficulties with sleep, some feel fatigue. Some are getting more angry. Some people have unexplained somatic syndromes, be it just pain or feeling bad,"" the WHO representative in Ukraine, Jarno Habicht, told the BBC. But, Mr Habicht says, Ukraine has made strides in dealing with the acute crisis and battling the Soviet-era stigma associated with mental health. He says mental health was prioritised during the first months of the war. “Ukraine started to talk about mental health, and I think that's something unique which we have not seen in many places,"" Mr Habicht says. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska spearheads a mental health campaign called How are you? and she also held the Third Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen focusing on mental health in times of war. It was co-hosted by the British broadcaster, author and mental health campaigner Stephen Fry. In an interview with the BBC's Ukrainecast, Mr Fry described the mental health challenges facing Ukraine as an ""urgent crisis"", but said he was also impressed by what Ukraine is doing to address it. ""It's extraordinary to me that in Ukraine this is being talked about,"" Mr Fry said. ""It is certainly a strength of Ukraine. The day Russians start to talk about the mental health of their soldiers and the crises amongst them will be the day that it's moved away from some of the totalitarian horror in which it seems to be mired at the moment."" According to psychotherapist Anna Stativka, one of the ways in which Ukrainian society has responded to the trauma of war is by coming together. She says that people have generally become much more ready to help to each other and are much more polite, even in public places. “People talk to neighbours more. So many are volunteering, donating, trying to help each other. This is a very stabilising factor. We see much more trust towards each other, much more empathy,"" she says. Maria Ivashchenko is now raising four children on her own. But she is smiling again, even if through tears sometimes. He message to those who are struggling with their loss is: ""Don't be afraid to talk to people. Get out of your bubble. Don't be alone.” ""The most important thing is not to give up and not to think that you're alone in this world, or that nobody cares. Oh yes, they do,"" she says.

The impact of this war will be felt by generations to come, but Ukrainians are working hard to deal with the trauma now."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj5qepe4wo,UK sanctions Russian troops over chemical weapons use in Ukraine,Russia's Radiological Chemical and Biological Defence troops will be subject to an assets freeze and travel ban.,6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:43.787967,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The UK has sanctioned Russian soldiers it says have used chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. Russia’s Radiological Chemical and Biological Defence troops, and their commander Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, will be subject to an assets freeze and travel ban. Two of the Russian defence ministry's scientific laboratories have also been designated. Kirillov is also a ""significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation"", the Foreign Office said. The US has previously accused Russian forces of using hazardous chemicals in Ukraine, including ""riot control agents"" such as tear gas and the toxic choking agent chloropicrin – first deployed in battle during World War One. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not sit “idly by whilst Putin and his mafia state ride roughshod over international law, including the Chemical Weapons Convention”. Lammy called Russia’s “flagrant” use of chemical agents “cruel and inhumane” and vowed to use all the powers at his disposal to combat the “malign activity”. Announcing the sanctions, defence Secretary John Healey said: ""Our message to Putin and his regime is clear: you cannot break international law without facing the consequences.” Healey said the two Russian Ministry of Defence centres were sanctioned for providing “support for the development and deployment of these inhumane weapons for use on the front lines”. The UK is providing Ukraine with vital equipment and training to protect its people against chemical weapons, he added. In May, the US accused Russia of deploying chemical weapons as a ""method of warfare"" in Ukraine, in violation of international laws banning their use. State Department officials said Russia used the choking agent chloropicrin to win ""battlefield gains"" over Ukraine. The Kremlin rejected the accusations at the time, calling them ""baseless"". The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a global watchdog that oversees implementation of the CWC, says a chemical weapon is a substance used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties. Chloropicrin - which the US says Russia has used to ""dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions"" - is an oily substance which was widely used during World War One. It causes irritation of the lungs, eyes and skin and can cause vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, according to the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC). The chemical's use in war is expressly banned under the CWC, and is listed as a choking agent by the OPCW. US officials have previously said Russian troops regularly used ""riot control agents,"" like tear gas, during the war in Ukraine."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zvd7ldzko,Zelensky meets Starmer as he seeks more support for war,It comes as the Ukrainian army prepares for a third winter since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.,4 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:43.883548,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has held talks with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street, as the Ukrainian president seeks to shore up European support for his country's war effort. Zelensky said he would share details of his ""victory plan"" during the meeting, while Sir Keir pledged his ""continued commitment and support"" for Ukraine. The meeting comes as the conflict with Russia heads into its third winter and amid the prospect of Donald Trump, who is widely considered to be less supportive of Ukraine, winning the US presidential election in November. Mark Rutte, the new head of the Nato military alliance, also attended Downing Street to take part in the talks with Zelensky. The Nato chief held a one-to-one meeting with the prime minister, while Zelensky will is expected to travel to France and Italy to continue his European diplomatic tour.  A red carpet was laid out in Downing Street for Zelensky's arrival and the two leaders shook hands and embraced on the steps of No 10. Speaking in No 10, the Ukrainian president said: ""Thanks to the UK people, the people of your great country, for your [strength in us] from the very beginning of the war."" Zelensky said he would share details of Ukraine's so-called victory plan, a strategy for the next phase of the war. The president has been seeking to garner renewed support for his war efforts in recent weeks. Details of that plan have not yet been made public, but it relies on increased Western support and security guarantees. That includes setting out a clear path towards Ukraine’s membership in Nato and lifting restrictions on the use of Western supplied long range weapons. Sir Keir said it was ""very important we're able to show our continued commitment to support Ukraine"" and it was a chance to ""go through the plan, to talk in more detail"". ""This is such an important fight for you and for us as well,"" the prime minister said. The head of the British armed forces, the defence secretary and the prime minister's senior national security adviser also attended talks with Zelensky and his team, which lasted for around two hours. Rutte told BBC News after the meeting that ""it's crucial for Ukraine to prevail,"" adding the situation ""is not only a problem for the Ukraine, but also a threat to all of us"". An agenda for the Downing Street talks has not been made public, but Rutte said the parties discussed the use of British-supplied missiles on Russian territory. Zelensky has repeatedly pressed allies for his forces to be allowed to target Russian military logistic targets deep inside Russia using Storm Shadow missiles but has so far been frustrated in his efforts. The US also needs to give permission for the missiles to be used inside Russia. Rutte, when asked whether he would support such use, said that legally, Ukraine is allowed to use its weapons if they can hit targets in Russia that present a threat to Ukraine, but the decision was not up to him. ""That is up to the individual allies to decide how weapons they deliver into Ukraine can be used,"" he said. There is support in Whitehall for lifting the restrictions on the use of the Storm Shadow missiles but the government does not want to go it alone.  The US has yet to give the green light and Germany is also opposed. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he would consider the move an escalation and there is concern among Nato countries about risking a Kremlin response. Ukraine had hoped a planned summit later this week in Ramstein, Germany, which was set to bring the country's biggest military backers together, would yield movement on the use of long-range missiles. But that summit has been delayed because US President Joe Biden is unable to attend while he oversees the emergency response to Hurricane Milton, which has caused widespread damage in Florida. Russia has made modest but strategically important gains on the battlefield in recent weeks, though a decisive breakthrough from either side remains elusive. Zelensky is keenly aware that US support for Ukraine may cool if Trump returns to the White House, which would leave Ukraine more dependent on European allies like the UK. That could test the West's stamina as the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion approaches, with growing questions around war fatigue and the West’s long-term support. Rutte, when asked his concerns about a potential Trump presidency, told the BBC that the former president is ""fully aware of the fact that for the US to stay safe, that Nato membership... is crucial"". The UK has contributed £12.8bn to Ukraine in military and other aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and more than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have temporarily settled in the UK. Since taking office, the prime minister has continued the policy of the previous Conservative government in offering strong financial and diplomatic support for Ukraine's war effort. It is the second time Zelensky has visited Downing Street since Sir Keir was elected prime minister. In July, the Ukrainian president became the first foreign leader to be hosted at No 10 since the change of government. While Sir Keir was still leader of the opposition, he also met Zelensky in Ukraine in February, and held talks with him at a Nato summit in July. That meeting of Nato countries saw the bloc promise Ukraine an ""irreversible path"" to membership, something the Ukrainian government considers vital for its security.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj71ywyeo,Ukraine approves large war-time cabinet reshuffle,"Parliament approves several new ministers, but some MPs accuse President Zelensky of centralising power.",5 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:43.984453,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine's parliament has approved President Volodymyr Zelensky's biggest government reshuffle of cabinet ministers since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Andrii Sybiha, a 49-year-old former diplomat and ex-adviser to President Zelensky, was appointed as foreign minister in the revamp, which saw nine new ministers take office.  The shake-up had been expected for months, with much of the president's cabinet left holding office in an acting capacity after a spate of resignations and dismissals.  But critics have accused the president of seeking to centralise power around his office, with several of the new ministers having once served as his advisers. Supporters say that concentrating political power is necessary during war. In the opening months of the war, Mr Zelensky largely kept senior political and military figures in place.  But in May last year, he fired defence minister Oleksii Reznikov after a series of corruption scandals, then sacked Kyiv's top military commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi earlier this year. In his nightly address from Kyiv, President Zelensky justified the changes, telling Ukrainians that he wanted his government to be ""more active"" in securing aid from the country's Western allies.  Mr Sybiha will replace Dmytro Kuleba at the foreign ministry, but his appointment is not expected to alter policy significantly. President Zelensky and his office have broadly overseen international relations from the presidential palace.  The ex-ambassador is seen by some as being closer to Andriy Yermak, the increasingly powerful presidential chief of staff. Mr Yermak was said to have clashed with Mr Kuleba.  Another key adviser to the president, Oleksiy Kuleba, has been appointed as deputy prime minister in charge of reconstruction, regions and infrastructure. He previously served as deputy head of the presidential office.  Other changes include the promotion of 38-year-old Olha Stefanyshyna. She has been reappointed as deputy prime minister in charge of European integration, while also being handed the justice portfolio.  Analysts say the move represents Ukraine's desire to move forward with its bid for EU membership. She told MPs on Wednesday that ""hundreds and thousands"" of legal changes are needed before Kyiv can become a member of the bloc.  Meanwhile, Herman Smetanin, 32, has been appointed strategic industries minister in charge of domestic arms production, a key position as Kyiv's forces face intense Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while continuing their incursion into Russia's Kursk border province.  Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, MP Inna Sovsun echoed the president in saying the reshuffle was ""the best way to bring in new people, new ideas into the government"".  But Dmytro Razumkov, a former ally of Mr Zelensky's turned opposition MP, said the new changes would have little impact on decision-making, claiming in a Telegram post on Thursday that the ""Cabinet of Ministers has not influenced anything for a long time"".  Another opposition MP, Iryna Gerashchenko, accused Mr Zelensky of ""breaking parliamentary tradition"" by not being present at votes to approve his new ministers.  She said that the nomination of key posts, such as that of foreign minister, were a ""presidential prerogative"", adding that ""always the presidents represented their candidates"".  Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker with Mr Zelesnky's Servant of the People Party, rejected the concerns, noting that the president has always been quick to dismiss ministers who were not meeting his expectation, citing the early dismissal of his first Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk after less than a year in office.  ""He came from the sphere of business and he is himself a result-orientated person,"" Mr Merezhko told the BBC.  ""When Zelensky sees someone can't deliver, he will make a change,"" he added, noting some of ministers dismissed this week were ""professionally exhausted"".  Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal welcomed the new appointments, acknowledging that they faced ""difficult tasks,"" but insisted that ""their experience and skills will help in the implementation of our state's strategic goals"".  Under martial law, Mr Zelensky boasts considerable executive powers. With elections suspended while the war continues, and the Servant of the People Party maintaining a parliamentary majority, there is a limited check on his government, some experts say.  But Mr Merezhko dismissed concerns of an over-centralisation of power around Mr Zeleasnky's office.  ""In a state of war, some kind of concentration of power is a necessity,"" he told the BBC. ""After all he is the commander-in-chief and we are waging a war, the whole state is like an army right now.""  ""The challenge for us, and we are coping with this challenge so far, is to preserve democracy and pluralism."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5y80dr5vo,Ukraine denounces Russia's reported execution of captured troops,"Kyiv's human rights ombudsman has written to the UN, after reports that Russia executed Ukrainian PoWs.",1 day ago,2024-10-14 18:25:44.081398,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine's human rights ombudsman has denounced the alleged execution of nine captured Ukrainian troops by Russian forces in the Kursk border region. Dmytro Lubinets said he had written to the United Nations and the Red Cross about the allegations, accusing Moscow of breaching ""all the rules and customs of war"".  The intervention follows reporting by Ukrainian battlefield analysis site DeepState, which published drone footage purporting to show the dead troops who it said were drone operators. Officials in Russia have yet to comment on the allegations.  Kyiv is believed to have deployed thousands of troops into the Russian border region since it launched its shock incursion earlier this summer. The images published by DeepState showed the dead Ukrainian troops stripped to their underwear and lying face down in what appeared to be farmland in Kursk. The BBC cannot independently verify the images.  The outlet said the drone operators had been overrun by a rapid Russian advance.  ""These actions must not go unpunished, and the enemy must bear full responsibility,"" Mr Lubinets wrote in a message to Telegram. ""The international community should not turn a blind eye to such crimes!""  Kyiv has frequently accused Russian of executing captured Ukrainian troops - a war crime under the Geneva Convention. Earlier this month the prosecutor general's office alleged that Russian forces had executed 93 Ukrainian soldiers since the beginning of the conflict.  It added that an official investigation had been opened into reports that 16 Ukrainian soldiers were executed in the eastern Donetsk region near the city of Pokrovsk - where fighting has raged for months. Officials said the reports would mark the ""largest mass execution"" of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian troops since Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022.  The Kremlin denies that its soldiers have been committing war crimes in Ukraine.  The reports come as Russian forces continue to attack Ukrainian positions in Kursk. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address from Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had fought off a renewed Russian advance in the region.  Analysts say that Kyiv launched the offensive to try and force Russia to redirect some of its troops from its offensive in eastern Ukraine. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has estimated that around 40,000 Russian forces are now active in Kursk - up from 11,000 when Ukrainian troops first crossed the border.  But the offensive has failed to slow Russian momentum in the eastern Donbas region, where relentless attacks has slowly pushed Ukrainian forces backwards.  The Ukrainian leader acknowledged that ""there are very difficult conditions, with harsh enemy actions"" in both Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia in his address on Saturday.  On Sunday morning, the Russian defence ministry said its forces had seized the village of Mykhailivka, which sits along a highway near the key city of Pokrovsk.  Russian forces have been advancing towards Pokrovsk - which is a key logistics hub - for months. Experts say if Russia can seize the city Ukraine's ability to resupply units in other crucial towns would become far more difficult.  Meanwhile, Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine continued overnight. Air force officials in Kyiv said Moscow launched 68 drones and four missiles towards Ukrainian territory. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr5n4nlg79o,Russia sentences 72-year-old American to jail on mercenary charges,Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard was fighting on the Ukrainian side when he was captured by Russian forces in 2022.,7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:48.629276,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Russian court has sentenced a 72-year-old American citizen to almost seven years in jail for allegedly fighting as a mercenary for Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen James Hubbard was serving in a defence unit based in the eastern city of Izyum when he was captured by Russian forces in April 2022, shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Hubbard ""systematically received material compensation"" for his participation in the war on the Ukrainian side, a statement by the Russian Prosecutor General said. He has now been sentenced to 6 years and 10 months imprisonment in a penal colony. Hubbard, a native of Michigan, pleaded guilty to the charges last week, according to Russian state media. However, his sister Patricia Fox told Reuters that Hubbard held pro-Russian views and was unlikely to have taken up arms at his age. ""He is so non-military,"" Ms Fox told Reuters, adding that her brother ""never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that... He's more of a pacifist."" According to Ms Fox, Hubbard had moved to Ukraine in 2014 and lived there for a time with a woman, surviving off a small pension. He and his partner later split but he continued living in Ukraine. Although Hubbard was detained by Russian forces in early 2022, his case only became public when his trial began in Moscow in September. In a video shared by Russian authorities, Hubbard can be seen walking with difficulty inside the defendants' glass box in the courtroom where he was sentenced on Monday.  The eastern Ukrainian city of Izyum where Hubbard was detained was captured by Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine. It was liberated by Ukrainian troops in the autumn of 2022. In a separate case, on Monday Robert Gilman, an ex-US marine who was already serving time in Russia for an assault conviction, was handed seven years and one month in jail for assaulting a prison officer.  At least 10 US nationals are currently behind bars in Russia. A number of Americans were released in a prisoner swap between Moscow and the West in August. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4d1xrep1ko,Russian strike kills eight in fresh attack on Ukrainian port,"Russian missiles hit a container ship - the third attack on a civilian vessel in four days, officials say.",4 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:48.739604,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russian missiles have hit a civilian container ship at a port in Ukraine's Odesa region, killing eight people, according to local officials. ""This is the third attack on a civilian vessel in the past four days,"" said the region's head, Oleh Kiper, who described it as ""yet another crime"" by an ""insidious enemy"". He said Russia had targeted port infrastructure and all the victims were Ukrainian. A 46-year-old port employee and another man, aged 26, died of their injuries in hospital, while several others were wounded. The wave of strikes on Ukraine's Black Sea ports coincided with a European tour by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is visiting leaders in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin. In Downing Street on Thursday, he met UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Nato's new Secretary General Mark Rutte, who warned this week that Ukraine could be facing its toughest winter since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelensky had been due to meet US President Joe Biden along with other Western allies in Berlin on Saturday, but Biden cancelled his trip because of the threat to the US from Hurricane Milton.  That is a blow for Ukraine, less than a month away from the US elections and with increasing concerns over the continued support of key allies. Zelensky played down any disappointment before his trip to London though. ""Any leader in similar circumstances would have stayed in their country,"" he told journalists in Croatia on Wednesday. He expected a ""new schedule"" for the leaders’ meeting to be prepared shortly. Later on Thursday, Zelensky held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, and then went to Rome to meet Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. The Italian leader announced that Rome would host the next ""recovery conference"" to help Ukraine's reconstruction in July 2025. On Friday, Zelensky will meet Pope Francis at the Vatican before heading to Germany to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Russia's overnight attacks on Ukraine also wounded several people in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.  Twenty-nine homes were destroyed and pictures released by regional officials show a giant crater in the mud, with bricks and wood strewn all around.  Warnings of a glide-bomb attack had come at 06:00 local time (04:00 BST) on Thursday. Residents were left looking at the ruins in their dressing gowns and slippers.  Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones targeted a military airfield in the Maikop region of southern Russia. Local officials evacuated 40 people from a nearby village. Russia's missile strike on the Odesa region hit a Panamanian-registered ship on Wednesday night, Oleh Kiper said - two days after a Palau-flagged ship was attacked, killing one person on board. Another ship, which was said to be carrying 6,000 tonnes of corn, was attacked on Sunday.  The Ukrainian government says Russia's attacks on Odesa's Black Sea ports are aiming to destroy grain exports that guarantee international food security, at a key time of year following the harvest. Russia has not commented publicly on its latest attacks. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was not asked about them in his daily briefing with journalists in Moscow - and volunteered no information. ""It feels like they are focusing on the port again, like last summer,"" Diana, a local resident, told the BBC.  She lives close to the waterfront and heard the missile strikes this week. ""I feel this anxiety, and I feel it increases day by day. I can’t say my general state is calm."" Diana said Iranian-made Shahed drones were also now launched at Odesa ""almost every night"", buzzing ominously overhead before they swooped or were shot down by air defences. But she is worried about the way out of this war, too, as President Zelensky travels the world presenting what he’s calling a ""Victory Plan"". ""It’s more like anger, because we have no idea what this plan is about,"" she explained. ""We can only assume that it would be some kind of compromise. But Russia has already caused so much damage and killed so many people. I’m not sure, after this scale of tragedy and pain, our society would accept any kind of compromise in Russia’s favour."" Ukraine’s original ""peace formula"" included restoring Ukraine’s territorial integrity and security commitments - but the details of Zelensky’s current plan have not been made public. ""This war has to end,"" Oleksandr, another resident of the Odesa region, told the BBC. ""It’s been tough and bloody and it feels like it’s going in spirals, and now it feels like the level of violence and destruction is growing.""  ""Russia needs to be stopped."" He saw the flash then felt the blast wave of another attack earlier this week - and sees the renewed Russian strikes on Ukraine’s attempts to maintain its grain exports as particularly disturbing. ""This is a different level,"" he said. ""Russian ballistic missiles get better and we don’t have enough air defences, just a lot of promises. But the situation is getting worse. And, as we see, more people die."" According to Ukrainian figures, more than 20 civilian ships have now been damaged in Russian attacks since the start of the war in 2022. Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, has appealed to ""responsible states"" to ensure freedom of navigation and food security. Grain silos and other port infrastructure have been badly damaged too. Last week, the port of Izmail was targeted by drones near the River Danube and a Romanian border crossing and grain facility were damaged. However, Ukraine has succeeded in creating a maritime corridor to ensure the safety of grain exports, after Moscow pulled out of a Black Sea grain deal last year.  Some 962,000 tonnes of grain have been exported so far this month, says the agriculture ministry in Kyiv - double the volume shipped in the same period last year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c981pv02vryo,Ukraine strikes oil depot in occupied Crimea,Officials in Kyiv say they hit an oil processing facility in the occupied peninsula overnight.,7 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:48.851437,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine's military says it has carried out a strike on a large oil terminal off the coast of the occupied Crimean Peninsula, the latest in a wave of attacks targeting Russian-controlled energy facilities.  Officials in Kyiv said the country's missile forces launched the strike on the Feodosia terminal - the largest oil processing facility on the peninsula - in an attack overnight.  Russian-installed officials in Crimea have not confirmed the strike, but did acknowledge a fire at the facility. No casualties from the blast have been reported. A municipal-level emergency has been declared, with 300 people being evacuated from Feodosia due to the blaze, the state-run Tass news agency reported.  Footage circulating on social media appeared to show smoke rising over the Feodosia terminal. Local Russian-installed officials told RIA Novosti that efforts to extinguish the fire were ongoing.  Meanwhile, the defence ministry in Moscow said that 12 Ukrainian drones were shot down over the peninsula overnight out of a total of 21 launched by Kyiv.  In a statement announcing the attack, Ukraine's general staff said that oil products shipped from the terminal were being used to ""meet the needs of the Russian occupation army"". Russia illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014.  The facility was previously hit in a Ukrainian drone strike in March.  Kyiv has said that its strikes on Russian-energy facilities are fair retaliation for Moscow's strikes on its own energy infrastructure, which have frequently plunged millions into darkness.  At least 80% of Ukraine's thermal power and one third of its hydroelectric power generation has been destroyed in Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in June.  The Crimea blast comes as officials in Kyiv said the air force shot down 32 drones and two missiles launched towards the Ukrainian capital overnight by Russia.  Air force officials said one Kinzhal missile managed to evade air defences and hit an area around the Starokostiantyniv airfield in the Khmelnytskyi region. Starokostiantyniv has come under consistent Russian fire over the summer, with Moscow claiming the base houses F-16 fighter jets donated by the West.  Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023. The first batch of jets arrived earlier this summer, with fresh deliveries said to have arrived from the Netherlands on Monday.  Elsewhere, in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, officials said 17 people were injured in a Russian airstrike. Regional head Oleksandr Prokudin said a two-year-old boy and a four-year-old girl were among those injured when four bombs were dropped on the city. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qv3lnqy0vo,Mystery of Russia's secret weapon downed in Ukraine,Ukrainians watched intrigued as a Russian stealth combat drone was apparently shot down by a Russian jet.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:48.951270,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When two white vapour trails cross the sky near the front line in eastern Ukraine, it tends to mean one thing. Russian jets are about to attack. But what happened near the city of Kostyantynivka was unprecedented. The lower trail split in two and a new object quickly accelerated towards the other vapour trail until they crossed and a bright orange flash lit up the sky. Was it, as many believed, a Russian war plane shooting down another in so-called friendly fire 20km (12 miles) from the front line, or a Ukrainian jet shooting down a Russian plane? Intrigued, Ukrainians soon found out from the fallen debris that they had just witnessed the destruction of Russian’s newest weapon - the S-70 stealth combat drone. This is no ordinary drone. Named Okhotnik (Hunter), this heavy, unmanned vehicle is as big as a fighter jet but without a cockpit. It is very hard to detect and its developers claim it has “almost no analogy” in the world. That all may be true, but it clearly went astray, and it appears the second trail seen on the video came from a Russian Su-57 jet, apparently chasing it down. The Russian plane may have been trying to re-establish the contact with the errant drone, but as they were both flying into a Ukrainian air defence zone, it is assumed a decision was made to destroy the Okhotnik to prevent it ending up in enemy hands. Neither Moscow nor Kyiv have commented officially on what happened in the skies near Kostyantynivka. But analysts believe the Russians most likely lost control over their drone, possibly due to jamming by Ukraine’s electronic warfare systems. This war has seen many drones but nothing like Russia’s S-70. It weighs more than 20 tonnes and reputedly has a range of 6,000km (3,700 miles).  Shaped like an arrow, it looks very similar to American X-47B, another stealth combat drone created a decade ago. The Okhotnik is supposed to be able to carry bombs and rockets to strike both ground and aerial targets as well as conduct reconnaissance. And, significantly, it is designed to work in conjunction with Russia’s fifth-generation Su-57 fighter jets. It has been under development since 2012 and the first flight took place in 2019. But until last weekend there was no evidence that it had been used in Russia’s two-and-a-half-year war in Ukraine. Earlier this year it was reportedly spotted at the Akhtubinsk airfield in southern Russia, one of the launch sites to attack Ukraine. So it is possible the abortive flight over Kostyantynivka was one of Moscow’s first attempts to test its new weapon in combat conditions. Wreckage of one of Russia’s notorious long-range D-30 glide bombs was reportedly found amidst the aircraft’s crash site.  These deadly weapons use satellite navigation to become even more dangerous. So what was the Okhotnik doing flying with an Su-57 jet? According to Kyiv-based aviation expert Anatoliy Khrapchynskyi, the warplane may have transmitted a signal from a ground base to the drone to increase the extent of their operation. The stealth drone’s failure is no doubt a big blow for Russia’s military. It was due to go into production this year but clearly the unmanned aircraft is not ready. Four protype S-70s are thought to have been built and it is possible the one blown out of the sky over Ukraine was the most advanced of the four. Even though it was destroyed, Ukrainian forces may still be able to glean valuable information about the Okhotnik. “We may learn whether it has its own radars to find targets or whether the ammunition is pre-programmed with co-ordinates where to strike,” explains Anatoliy Khrapchysnkyi. Just by studying images from the crash site, he believes it is clear the drone’s stealth capabilities are rather limited. As the engine nozzle’s shape is round, he says it can be picked up by radar. The same goes for the many rivets on the aircraft which are most likely made of aluminium. No doubt the wreckage will be pored over by Ukrainian engineers and their findings passed on to Kyiv’s Western partners. And yet, this incident shows the Russians are not standing still, reliant on their massive human resources and conventional weapons. They are working on new and smarter ways to fight the war.  And what failed today may succeed next time."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq64qm2v7m9o,N Korea's Kim calls Putin 'closest comrade',Kim said relations between North Korea and Russia would be raised to a new level.,6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:49.050210,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent a birthday message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him his ""closest comrade"".  Kim, congratulating Putin on his 72nd birthday, added that relations between both countries would be raised to a new level.  Relations between Pyongyang and Moscow have deepened since the start of the Ukraine war - in a move that has worried the West. Separately on Tuesday, Kim said Pyongyang would speed up steps to make his country a military super power with nuclear weapons.  According to Yonhap News quoting North Korean state media KCNA, Kim praised relations between both countries, saying they had become ""invincible and eternal"", since Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.  ""Meetings and comradely ties between us... will make a positive contribution to further consolidating the eternal foundation of the DPRK-Russia friendship,"" he added, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The relationship between North Korea and Russia goes back decades - to Stalin and Kim Il-sung, the current Kim's grandfather. The Soviet Union supported North Korea in its early days with weapons and technology, and Pyongyang has never wanted to completely rely on China - which it does not fully trust. Earlier this year, Putin and Kim signed an agreement pledging that they would help each other in the event of ""aggression"" against either country - though it was unclear what would constitute aggression.  Kim has been accused of helping Russia in the war against Ukraine by supplying it with weapons in exchange for economic and technological assistance.  There has been growing evidence that Russia has been deploying North Korean missiles in Ukraine. For Putin, the relationship is likely more tactical than strategic. He needs support for his war in Ukraine and North Korea will certainly be willing to sell him whatever munitions he is willing to pay for. Jeffrey Lewis, a director at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, had earlier said both Kim and Putin were ""trying to reduce the pain of international sanctions by creating an alternate network of friends and partners beyond the reach of US sanctions"".  North Korea certainly can benefit enormously from access to Russian military technology – which despite Russia’s problems is still far more advanced than North Korea’s homegrown and reverse-engineered systems.   North Korea is primarily trying to perfect its nuclear and missile arsenal. It has made very surprising progress in the last decade in producing new missile systems and miniaturising its nuclear devices.  But Russia has far more advanced thermonuclear warhead designs, re-entry vehicle designs and solid rocket motor designs. During a visit by Kim to Russia in September 2023, Putin had promised to help North Korea develop its satellites, after several failed launches by Pyongyang.  A South Korean lawmaker also separately on Tuesday claimed that Seoul's military had detected apparent signs that North Korea had started to build a possible nuclear-powered submarine. Citing Korea's intelligence agency, Rep Kang Dae-sik said construction was still in its early stages and ""further confirmation is needed on whether it is nuclear powered"".  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8nxe3jy6o,Plea not to forget about Ukraine as donations drop,"Essex based UK-Aid says it has noticed a fall in donations possibly down to ""donor fatigue"".",3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:49.158114,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A charity that provides aid to Ukraine has warned of ""donor fatigue"".  UK Aid, based in Dunmow, Essex, said it had noticed a decline in donations as the war in Ukraine continues, while financial pressures remain in the UK.  It makes three trips a year to Chernihiv, an area of the country which has been routinely bombarded by Russian forces over the last two-and-a-half years.  Svetlana Ryzhevska, who works for the centre and fled to the UK two years ago, said: ""The need never reduces, they keep attacking us. People keep suffering."" The charity, set up in 2001, partners with the Revival centre in Chernihiv, and was originally started to help people affected by the Chernobyl disaster.  The centre helps with rehabilitation for disabled children and victims of war. Volunteers said people in Ukraine were still in need of food and medical supplies.  Barbara Honeyman, a volunteer, said: ""Imagine your house gets bombed, you lose everything, you need everything. ""Also, we’ve got frontline military hospitals, ordinary hospitals, maternity, everything."" Ms Ryzhevska was forced to flee to the UK with her family and said the need was still as great as it was in 2022.  She said: ""We are very grateful the UK is standing with us and is helping our people to survive.""  The charity sends three consignments of aid to Ukraine every year but UK-Aid co-founder Alan Hilliar said he had noticed a decrease in donations.  He said: ""We are struggling in most areas, yes there’s donor fatigue, but also there’s lots of other issues with people unable to give, because that’s the important thing - people are struggling here."" He said donations of food, toiletries and money were still critical.  Having worked in the region for so long, he said it had been ""heartbreaking"" to see the devastation.  ""Almost everyone I know has lost someone."" He said he felt Ukraine was ""dropping down the list"" and urged people not to ""forget about Ukraine"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvye9l43dgo,Oasis on the Adriatic where Ukrainians and Russians have gone to escape war,"Immigrants descended in large numbers on Montenegro, which has managed the influx despite its small size.",8 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:49.262657,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"""Our people respect the Russian and Ukrainian people,"" says Savo Dobrovic. ""I simply haven’t noticed any bad relations."" It sounds like a recipe for tension and confrontation: tens of thousands of people from opposing sides in a bitter, protracted war descending on a small Balkan nation with its own very recent memories of conflict. But Montenegro has managed the influx so far. Since February 2022, Ukrainian refugees and Russian exiles have fanned out across Europe, fleeing war, conscription and Vladimir Putin’s rule. More than four million people have fled Ukraine for temporary protection in the European Union - to Germany and Poland and elsewhere.  But beyond the EU, Montenegro has let in more than 200,000 Ukrainians, making it the highest per capita Ukrainian refugee population in the world. ""Montenegrins are very patient, they are people who want to help,"" says Dobrovic, a property owner in the Adriatic resort of Budva. The word polako, meaning ""slowly"", is integral to their way of life. ""It amazes me – they’re a mountain people, but all that’s left from that noisy temperament is a desire to hug you,"" says Natalya Sevets-Yermolina, who runs the Russian cultural centre Reforum in Budva. Montenegro, a Nato member and candidate for EU status, has not been without its problems. It has a substantial ethnic Serb population, many of whom have pro-Russian sympathies, and six Russian diplomats were expelled two years ago on suspicion of spying. But it has won praise for its response to the refugee crisis - in particular its decision to grant Ukrainians temporary protection status, which has now been extended until March 2025.  The most recent figures from September last year show more than 10,000 had benefited, and the UN says 62,000 Ukrainians had registered some legal status by then. That is nearly 10% of Montenegro’s population.  Thousands more have come from Russia or Belarus. For all of these groups Montenegro is attractive for its visa-free regime, similar language, common religion and Western-leaning government. That welcome does not always extend to their quality of life. While there are plenty of jobs for immigrants in coastal areas, they are often seasonal and poorly paid. Better quality, professional work is harder to find. The luckier ones have been able to retain the jobs they had back home, working remotely. Another difficulty is that it is almost impossible to get citizenship here, a problem for those who, for whatever reason, are unable to renew their passports. There has been a strong Russian presence in Montenegro for years, and it has a reputation, perhaps unfairly, as a playground for the very rich. Many Russians and Ukrainians have property or family connections, but there is also a large contingent who ended up here almost by chance, feeling completely lost. It was for them that non-profit shelter Pristaniste (Haven) was set up. Based in Budva, it gives the most desperate arrivals a safe place and a warm welcome for two weeks as they find their feet. They are given help with documentation, hunting for jobs and flats, and Ukrainians can also come for two weeks as a ""holiday"" from the war. Valentina Ostroglyad, 60, came here with her daughter a year ago from Zaporizhzhia, a regional capital in south-eastern Ukraine that comes under repeated, deadly Russian bombardment. ""When I first arrived in Montenegro I couldn’t handle fireworks, or even a roof falling in – I associated it with those explosions,"" she said. Now she is working as an art teacher and enjoying her adopted country: ""Today I went up to a spring, admired the mountains and sea. And people are very kind."" The ongoing grimness of the war ensures that Ukrainians keep coming, no longer able to endure the pain and suffering at home. Sasha Borkov, a driver from Kharkiv, was separated from his wife and six children, aged four to 16, as they left Ukraine in late August. He was turned back at the Polish border - he previously did jail time in Hungary for transporting irregular migrants and is banned from the EU. His family were allowed to continue to Germany while he, after a tense few days travelling around Europe, was finally allowed to touch down in Montenegro. Visibly stressed and exhausted, he described how the war had finally driven him and his family from their home. ""When you see and hear every day houses being destroyed, people being killed, it’s impossible to convey,"" he said. ""Our flat isn’t damaged but windows get broken, and [the bombs] are getting closer and closer."" Borkov said he had been looking at the possibility of going to Montenegro since the start of the war: ""[Pristaniste] took me in, gave me food and drink, a place to stay. I rested, then I started looking for work.""  He has already found a job and his family are due to join him here. He is applying for temporary protection, and a place at a Ukrainian refugee centre. Elsewhere in Budva, Yuliya Matsuy has set up a children’s centre for Ukrainians to take lessons in history, English, maths and art – or just to dance, sing and watch films. Many were traumatised by war, she says: ""They weren’t interested in the mountains or the sea, they wanted nothing.” “But when they started interacting, their eyes were smiling. Those children’s smiles and emotions were something that’s impossible to convey. And only then we understood we were doing the right thing."" Now most are settled. The younger children learned Montenegrin and now attend local schools, while the older ones have continued their learning remotely at Ukrainian schools. Both charities have volunteers from several countries and don't check passports - there's no emphasis on citizenship here. Other parts of Europe have seen occasional friction between Ukrainians and Russians. At the start of the war, Germany recorded a rise in attacks on both.  But there has been little of that so far in Montenegro. There is a sense of tolerance here and Pristaniste and its volunteers have had a role in promoting it.  Sasha Borkov distinguishes between Russians he has met in Budva and those fighting the war in Ukraine. ""People here are trying to help, they’re not doing anything against our country, against us, against my children, [unlike] those who fire at and destroy our houses, and say that they’re liberating us."" Friendships have grown among volunteers and residents, and between residents, and one Russian-Ukrainian couple who lived at Pristaniste recently married. Empathy is a major factor. A recent talk in Budva by Kyiv-based journalist Olha Musafirova about her work, in Ukrainian, had Russians in the audience in tears, horrified by their country's actions. For Ukrainian actor Katarina Sinchillo, Russian diasporas can vary and Montenegro's is ""sensitive"". ""I think the people who live here are a somewhat different community because it’s the intelligentsia,"" she says, ""educated people who can’t live without the arts."" Sinchillo set up a theatre here, with husband and fellow actor Viktor Koshel, using actors from all over the former Soviet Union. Their plays are well attended, she says: ""Progressive Russian people, who are helping Ukraine, go with interest and pleasure."" Koshel says the environment here is perfect for such contacts. ”Here the countryside is heavenly, it takes you away from those urbanist, gloomy, depressive moods, political propaganda etc. You go to the sea and all that disappears."" They have also collaborated with veteran Russian rock musician Mikhail Borzykin, who has seen big changes in the Russian diaspora over the past three years. Russian-Ukrainian joint musical projects are vanishingly rare. Before the war, he says, ""fierce arguments"" about Putin in the Russian community were commonplace, but the recent influx of anti-war immigrants created a different atmosphere. ""The overwhelming majority of young people who have come here, they of course understand the horror of what’s happening, so there is agreement on the main questions,"" he says. As for the pro-Kremlin former members of Russia's corrupt elite, who he calls the vatnaya diaspora, they are sitting quietly in the properties they bought in Montenegro years ago. ""Conflicts are not aired in public,"" he says. Borzykin is part of a volleyball group of Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians and says they are ""all on the same wavelength"". Despite the relatively warm welcome, the future of some immigrants remains uncertain. Strict citizenship laws mean many of them will not be able to stay here indefinitely. Most Ukrainians seem keen to return home if the war ends, assuming they still have homes to go to. ""Currently there’s a huge threat to our lives, but if it ends of course we’ll go home,"" says Sasha Borkov. ""There's nowhere better than home"". But most Russians say it will take much more than the fall of the regime to persuade them to go back permanently. Natalya Sevets-Yermolina, who comes from the northern city of Petrozavodsk, says she's not in a hurry. ""I have the problem that it’s not Putin that persecuted me but those little people I lived in the same city with,"" she says. ""Putin is far away but those who do his bidding will remain, even if he dies soon."" Borzykin says he too is unlikely to return quickly, as attitudes could take decades to change. ""Germany needed 30 years [after the Nazis] while the new generation came along. I’m afraid I won’t have that long."" Oleg Pshenichny contributed to this article"

Northumberland County Council is spending £1.2m to buy and refurbish seven properties, mostly located in the south east of the county. The homes will house Ukranians seeking safety from the Russian invasion and Afghans who supported the UK in the war against the Taliban. Council leader Glen Sanderson said buying the homes was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". ""We must always remember the bravery of our troops and those Afghans who tried to help them find a peaceful way through a very serious and awful conflict,"" he said. The government will provide the money to buy the properties through the Local Authority Housing Fund, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The fund was set up to support councils in England to obtain accommodation for refugee families. Conservative councillor Colin Horncastle said the homes would be provided to ""people we know have a right to be in this country"". ""If we go down this route it will bring an extra £600,000 of government money in to provide property for people that we have a moral duty to provide for,"" he said. ""In case people are concerned about the type of people it is aimed at, the objectives of this are to support recent humanitarian schemes such as the Afghan and Ukrainian schemes which offer sanctuary via safe and legal entry routes."" He added the new homes would ""reduce pressure"" on existing housing schemes. ""It’s a win-win situation. This is bringing Government money in and adding to our housing stock.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqnwl49v43o,'Russians invaded my house and held a soldier captive there',"After Marina Perederii fled her home in Ukraine, it appeared in an online video of a Russian soldier looking through her photos.",3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:49.478548,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Marina Perederii’s home in the small mining city of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine was her pride and joy. 17 Sadova Street was little more than a shell when she and her husband bought it.  They lovingly renovated the house, painting cherry blossom and doves - symbols of love and well-being - in their bedroom. They built a swimming pool in the garden and a sauna in the basement. “Everything was planned with such passion,” she tells the BBC World Service. But the peace wasn’t to last. In February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Marina’s husband went to fight while she took their children and ran. Before fleeing, she recorded what she thought could be her last glimpse of their home. “My dear house, I don’t know if you will stand or not. I don’t know if we’ll ever return here... or if we’ll even survive at all,” she said in a video. The next time she saw her home was a year later in February 2023, through the eyes of a Russian soldier, in bodycam footage posted on social media.  A marine going by the name Fima was in her living room, flicking through photos of Marina and her family. “Beautiful,” he said, looking at one photo. It was a chilling image that made her angry. “I wish I had taken the albums with me,” Marina says. Ukraine spent two and a half years defending Vuhledar, and although Russian forces had launched a major offensive in 2023, they never fully managed to capture the city until the start of October 2024. During the long battle, as the front line shifted, Fima had led a group of soldiers to the suburbs in late January 2023 and got caught in heavy fighting on Sadova Street. He and some others entered Marina’s home. As his bodycam footage went viral back home, Fima was hailed as a hero. Official documents show that he was recalled from the front in February 2023 because of a leg wound. But what the footage didn’t show was that the Russians were keeping a Ukrainian soldier captive in Marina’s basement, who was starving and in desperate need of medical care. His name was Oleksii. Before the war, Oleksii worked as an IT specialist. When Russia invaded his country, he volunteered to fight and later became a drone operator in Vuhledar. His love of dancing earned him the nickname Dancer. When the Russians broke through Ukrainian lines in late January 2023, Oleksii and his comrades tried to retreat, but some of them, including Oleksii were shot.  Wounded, they were taken from house to house by Russian soldiers, with Oleksii eventually ending up in the basement of Marina’s home. He was held captive for almost a month - Russian footage uploaded online shows him wrapped in one of Marina’s carpets. During the battle for Vuhledar there was a point when the Russian soldiers retreated and they left Oleksii behind. In all he spent 46 days in Marina’s house and for much of that time he had barely any food or water. Injured, starving and dehydrated, he was unable to leave the building.  “I was able to find some crumbs on the floor,” he tells the BBC World Service from Kyiv. “There was a piece of cracker, which a mouse stole from me at night. I hid it, and then the mouse probably stole it because I couldn’t find it.” But hunger was nothing compared to thirst. One day, after the Russians had left, the desperate need for water almost killed Oleksii. He tore panels from a sauna in the hope that there might be water inside the pipes. He managed to break one open and drank some of the liquid inside, but it was antifreeze. Those few sips caused internal burns and were nearly fatal. Then, in March that year, when Ukrainian forces retook parts of Vuhledar and reached Sadova Street, another video from Marina’s home went viral. It shows ex-New Zealand soldier Kane Te Tai entering number 17 and finding Oleksii. “New Zealand, New Zealand, it’s me!” Oleksii shouts at his colleague, who had travelled to fight for Ukraine. Te Tai died in battle just two weeks later. Oleksii was carried out of the house and to safety. Had he been left just a few more days, Oleksii says he wouldn’t have made it. Several other Ukrainian and Russian soldiers are known to have died in and around Sadova Street during the battle for Vuhledar. “Thank God Oleksii survived. But the fact that people died in my house, it shocked me,” Marina says. “There is only death in there.” The BBC World Service asked the Russian Ministry of Defence about Oleksii’s treatment but received no response. Half a year after Oleksii’s rescue, his Russian captor was being lauded at home. He was no longer just referred to by his call sign, Fima, but by his first name, Andrei. State TV footage shows him re-enacting the Vuhledar assault and sharing his experiences with primary school children, where teachers present him as a hero. The BBC compared this footage with photographs of Andrei from hundreds of social media profiles and found a match - the same hairline, the same mole on the neck, and clear evidence of a leg injury. Number 17: My House of Horrors  A BBC Eye investigation from the World Service reveals how a family home in eastern Ukraine became the backdrop of three lives caught up in war: the fleeing homeowner, the starving prisoner and the Russian soldier.  Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK) His full name is Andrei Efimkin - a 28-year-old born in Russia’s Far East. We contacted him and asked about the video from Sadova Street, particularly where he flicked through the photos of Marina’s family. He told us he was playing a “psychological trick” on himself due to the incoming gunfire. “I grabbed the album and started looking at the photos to distract myself,” he said. “You know, actually, I felt so cold-blooded. For a second, to be honest, these thoughts ran through my mind - about who lived here.” But when asked about Marina directly, Efimkin said he didn’t want to answer any more questions and ended the call. Marina is now in Germany. As time passes, she is trying to build a new life, learn a new language and find bits of work here and there - but she still grieves her lost home in Vuhledar. “It’s so hard. I can still see my house in my dreams, it’s always in my head. I still hope that Ukraine will win and everything will be fine, we will come back,” she says. “My land is there, the air is mine.” But back on Sadova Street there is almost nothing left of her beloved house, which once again is no more than a shell. It can be recognised in drone footage shot from the air by a blue spot, where her swimming pool used to be, standing out against a backdrop of grey rubble."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crm2emgyv7lo,Taking aid to Ukraine 'is in my heart now',Kayleigh Jones says taking part in a Ukraine aid convoy was the most emotional thing she has done.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:54.313358,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A woman who took part in a convoy driving aid to Ukraine has said it was the ""most emotional thing"" she had done and hoped to repeat it one day. Kayleigh Jones, from Wem, said she decided to get involved with her partner Josh Katihrob, because his family was originally from Ukraine. They fundraised to buy a truck and supplies and then joined others from the Convoy 4 Ukraine group. She said it took five days to take the aid to the Lviv area and said when they got there they heard ""unbelievable"" stories of everyday life from the people living there. The couple left the UK on 16 September and have just returned, after leaving their vehicle with the Ukrainians. Mr Katihrob's family fled Ukraine during World War Two and Ms Jones said: ""We always wanted to give something back."" The pair of them bought a truck from a man in Shrewsbury and collected tinned food, wheelchairs, walking sticks and useful everyday items such as wet wipes and nappies. She said they were on the road for up to 15 hours a day on the journey across Europe. When they reached their destination, she said the first thing that hit her was that ""every single person that was working on the border was a woman,"" because all the men were away fighting. She said it had been a ""bit of a reality check"" for her, but it was ""just the norm for them"". While they were delivering the aid, she said the people there showed them photos and talked about their everyday life. Ms Jones said one woman told her about her 11-year-old son shouting every time a rocket went over. The family had to go and hide in a shelter, but she said: ""She was saying that her son doesn't fully understand and gets all excited for the rockets. ""It's everyday life for them, it's just normal and that's just unbelievable."" After leaving eight trucks in Ukraine, the Convoy 4 Ukraine group started the long journey home, but Ms Jones said it would not be her last trip. ""It is in my heart now,"" she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq843dg4geo,Stalker 2: 'We want to show Ukraine can make great games',How the Ukranian studio between an anticipated video game kept going when Russia invaded.,4 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:54.421948,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"""I would say that maybe half of our studio is currently working under the constant threat of being killed,"" says Evgeniy Kulik. Evgeniy is a technical producer on Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, an upcoming video game developed by Kyiv-based developer GSC Game World. It's a title fans of the original, released in 2007, have been awaiting for some time. But it might not have happened at all, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. BBC Newsbeat spoke to Evgeniy about how Stalker 2's developers kept going, losing colleagues to war, and why the studio feels it's so important for them to complete the game. The Chernobyl power plant was the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear accident. In 1986, when the country was under the control of the Soviet Union, there was an explosion at the nuclear power plant 90 miles from Ukrainian capital Kyiv.  At least 31 people were killed in the immediate aftermath and the blast created a fire that burned for 10 days, sending a plume of radioactive smoke across Europe. A 30-mile exclusion zone was set up around the nuclear reactor to keep people out, although the Ukrainian government had begun to admit tourists into the area before Russia's invasion. The original Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, was set on an alternative timeline where a second nuclear disaster had struck, creating an array of mutant creatures and other unnatural phenomena. Players took the role of a character tasked with exploring the post-apocalyptic setting and navigating the various factions fighting for control of the wasteland. The decision to set the game at the site was controversial - one developer has said ""the blood was still warm and it flowed in our veins"" - even 30 years later. But the game was a big hit, and Stalker 2 was first announced in 2010 - with the intention to build on the original's survival gameplay style. In 2018, GSC Game World announced that it was working towards an April 2022 release date. But just two months before that arrived, Russian troops and planes began to cross the border with Ukraine. War had begun. Stalker 2 is now due to come out on PC and Xbox in November, but a documentary about the making of the game was released this week. It shows members of the development team talking about the dawning realisation that Russia was about to invade.  Lead producer Mariia Grygorovych remembers commissioning buses to wait outside the company's offices in Kyiv, ready to transport employees and their families to Ukraine's western border. Ultimately, just over 180 made the journey when the invasion began, with 139 choosing to stay behind and help the war effort. Some have joined the military while others have continued to work on Stalker 2 in between their duties. Those who evacuated eventually set up a second studio in Prague, in the Czech Republic, rebuilding motion capture and audio studios from scratch. It also features members of the team who stayed in Ukraine talking about fighting for their country while continuing to work on the game. ""We load our weapons with one hand and make our game with the other,"" says one. Speaking to Newsbeat during the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany, Evgeniy tells Newsbeat much of Stalker 2's large Russian fanbase was unsupportive during the early days of the war. After the conflict broke out, the game's subtitle was altered to Heart of Chornobyl, to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the name. Russian voiceovers and subtitles have also been removed, and GSC has refused to release the game in Russia. The developers have blamed Ukraine's opponent for regular attempts to hack its servers. ""We tried to get some support from those people,"" says Evgeniy. ""But instead we received a lot of negativity.  ""So we decided to join up with the sanctions, let's say.""  Ukraine has tried to keep cultural events going during wartime - it won Eurovision in 2022 and its largest music festival made a comeback this summer. Evgeniy feels the same applies to Stalker 2. ""We would like to remind the world that Ukraine is capable of doing great games once again,"" he says. ""Games are part of the culture as well, just like music, movies, arts, books, and so on. ""So, yeah, it is an important work to the world."" Evgeniy says the studio also owes it to staff who've upended their lives to move, or who've joined the military, to see their work through. And the studio also wants to honour friends and colleagues who've died, such as Volodymyr Yehzov, a developer who was killed while defending Bahkmut from Russian troops. ""All those people really worked hard to make this happen and we should really push forward to make this happen and appreciate their effort,"" says Evgeniy. ""To make this happen in the memory of those people."" War Game: The Making of Stalker 2 can be viewed on YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzpnnwr3jo,Ukraine ports impossible to defend from attack - Odesa chief,A two-storey building was hit in the fourth such attack on the Black Sea coastal region in five days.,3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:25:54.538111,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The head of Ukraine's Odesa region has said its three ports are ""not possible"" to protect fully because they span such a large area and Russia has intensified its missile attacks. He was speaking to the BBC after a 16-year-old girl, two women and a man were  killed in a Russian strike on a two-floor building to the north-west of Odesa city. It was the fourth such attack on the Black Sea coastal region in five days, and regional head Oleh Kiper said ""probably a ballistic missile was targeting an infrastructure facility, but it hit nearby instead - into this place."" Russia has not commented on its wave of missile strikes. A further nine people were killed in an attack on a cargo ship early on Thursday. There have been ballistic missile strikes on Odesa’s ports before. But never so many, in quick succession.  Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Russia had carried out 60 such attacks in just three months, damaging or destroying almost 300 port facilities. He said 79 people had been killed or wounded and 22 civilian vessels hit. Oleh Kiper told the BBC that Odesa's current air defences were unable to cover all three ports in Odesa region as they spanned over about 80km (50 miles): ""So the main focus is on the city of Odesa, where over a million people live. The rest of the ports and towns remain in a difficult situation."" Other Ukrainian ports - in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolayiv regions - are no longer operating, making the facilities in Odesa more important than ever to Ukrainian exports. He suggested Russia was attacking civilian vessels now to harm Ukraine’s economy and to scare the world with what it could do. “They hit [the ships in Odesa] so that the insurance companies and the ship owners refuse to enter our ports, into the combat zone, Kiper said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's prosecutor-general has said criminal proceedings have begun into the death in Russian detention of a prominent Ukrainian journalist who chronicled life under occupation in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Viktoriia Roshchyna had been briefly detained in the occupied eastern city of Berdyansk in 2022 but she disappeared in the occupied east in August 2023 and it was not until a few months ago that Russian authorities confirmed she was being held. Ukrainian intelligence officials said she was supposed to have been included in a prisoner exchange and Russian reports said she died on 19 September while being moved to a detention centre in Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Roshchyna's death had come as a heavy blow. ""For all of us in Ukraine, the issue of captured and deported people remains incredibly painful. These are adults and children, many civilians who are now held in prisons and camps in Russia,"" he wrote on X. Zelensky met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Friday before heading to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He is promoting a ""victory plan"" to end the war and told a briefing in Berlin he would like to see the war end ""no later than next year, 2025,"" adding that it was very important that aid to Kyiv did not decrease in the coming year. Italy's Giorgia Meloni had earlier promised Zelensky that support for Kyiv would last ""for as long as needed"".  Zelensky denied he had been discussing terms for a ceasefire. ""The key is to strengthen Ukraine's positions and relations with our closest partners,"" he stressed. Russian forces continue to make gains in eastern Ukraine, and on Friday authorities in the strategically important hilltop city of Toretsk said only 40-50% of it remained under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian troops are outgunned and outnumbered and are also under pressure in the Pokrovsk. The two cities are seen as vital for maintaining the army's supply lines. Earlier this week Ukraine's military targeted a big oil terminal on the east coast of Russian-occupied Crimea.  Satellite images show the offshore facility at Feodosia is still burning five days after the attack. Russian-installed official Igor Tkachenko said that even though the fire was not out, it was fully under control. The Ukrainian military said the terminal was the biggest in Crimea and helped supply Russia's occupying forces.  More than 1,000 residents have had to leave their homes because of the strike, which Kyiv says is in retaliation for Russian attacks that have destroyed much of its power infrastructure."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lnerd17wyo,Zelensky gives his 'victory plan' a hard sell in the US - did the pitch fall flat?,"Ukraine's president met Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden as he bid for Western help to end the war.",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:54.645303,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"It was billed as a decisive week for Ukraine. A chance for President Volodymyr Zelensky to present his boldly named ""victory plan"" to America’s most powerful politicians, during a visit to the US. But it’s unclear if Kyiv is any closer to getting any of the key asks on its wish list. And Zelensky has antagonised senior Republicans, including Donald Trump. Zelensky told the New Yorker magazine he believed Trump ""doesn't really know how to stop the war"", while he described his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance as ""too radical"". His remarks about Trump and Vance were a ""big mistake"", says Mariya Zolkina, a Ukrainian political analyst and research fellow at the London School of Economics (LSE). Separately, Zelensky's visit to meet top democrats at an ammunition factory in the swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled as election interference by a senior congressional Republican. The backlash to the visit came as a ""big surprise"" to Zelensky’s team, adds Ms Zolkina – an operation normally known for its slick PR. Zelensky’s much-hyped visit was carefully timed to try and secure crucial support for Ukraine's war effort from President Joe Biden, who has just months left in office. But that also meant walking straight into a highly-charged US election campaign – a tightrope act. After reports that Trump had decided to freeze Zelensky out, the pair did eventually meet on Friday at Trump Tower in New York City. Standing side by side in front of reporters it was, at times, an awkward encounter. Trump declared he had a ""very good relationship"" with both Zelensky and Russia’s Vladimir Putin – an equivalence that is painful to Ukrainian ears. Zelensky gently interjected to say he hoped relations were better with him than with Putin - a remark laughed off by Trump. Trump had already been busy at rallies that week praising Russia’s historic military record, while lambasting the current US administration for giving ""billions of dollars"" to Zelensky who he claimed had ""refused to make a deal"" to end the conflict. Later Zelensky hailed the talks as “very productive” but there’s little sign yet that he had managed to adjust Trump’s fundamental approach. Although he told Fox News on Saturday that he'd received ""very direct information"" from Trump that ""he will be on our side"". At a rally in Michigan on Friday night, the Republican candidate again voiced his intention to quickly ""settle"" the war, a repeated claim that’s led many to conclude he could cut aid to Kyiv and press Ukraine into ceding territory. Meanwhile, in a thinly veiled attack on Trump, the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris said this week that those who would have Ukraine swap land for peace are supporting ""proposals for surrender"". Standing alongside her was none other than Zelensky as he carried out a dizzying round of diplomatic speed-dating and media interviews all through the week – including at the United Nations. There was news of some further financial support ahead of a meeting with Biden at the White House -  talks which were cordial but ambiguous in terms of their outcome, as Zelensky handed in his ""victory plan"" to end the war to the outgoing president. Its contents have not been published but Ukraine’s request to be able to use Western-made long-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia is widely thought to be one element.  Zelensky has for some time been asking Western countries for permission - but so far has not been given the green light. Also thought to be in the plan is a plea for more robust security guarantees, including a longed-for invitation to join the Nato military alliance. While the alliance makes encouraging noises about Ukraine’s future membership prospects, it’s been made clear that won’t happen while the country’s still at war. Moscow’s troops continue to be on the attack in Ukraine’s east, despite Kyiv’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region. Overall, the ""victory plan"" pitch is to bolster Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and push Putin towards a diplomatic peace. But it was another political mismatch, believes the LSE’s Ms Zolkina, with the suite of proposals failing to “raise much enthusiasm"". ""Ukraine has the idea that it should be doubling down on its ambitions,"" she says.  Zelensky is ""sticking to the idea of getting an invitation to Nato but the US just isn’t there yet,"" she adds. On the permission to use long-range missiles, critics of Biden have accused him of getting cold feet as he tries to help Harris into the White House. However Ms Zolkina says big announcements this week weren’t necessarily on the cards - although hopes remain that permission could yet come through, despite further nuclear threats from Putin. Here in Kyiv, people continue to insist they can’t conceive of giving up land to Russia - often on the basis that a truce would simply allow Putin to regroup and relaunch fresh attacks down the line. However Ms Zolkina believes that conversation around a ceasefire could change if genuinely meaningful security guarantees were on the table. “If Ukraine was promised membership of Nato or if Ukraine signed a really strong security agreement with a big international player, this discussion about a possible tactical ceasefire would turn in a different way and the political resistance would not be as strong as it now.” It has been a week where Zelensky went and gave his ""victory plan"" a hard sell. But the reality is that Washington DC has yet to show great eagerness, while events in the Middle East continue to divert attention away from Russia’s bloody invasion."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2knzxn9x7o,Russians claim key city of Vuhledar in Ukraine's east,For more than two years Russia has been trying to take this city as it advances in eastern Ukraine.,2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:54.761105,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russian troops have taken complete control of the eastern city of Vuhledar, which Ukrainian forces have been defending since the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale invasion two and a half years ago. Ukraine's eastern military command confirmed on Wednesday that they had told the troops still fighting in parts of the Vuhledar to pull back to avoid becoming surrounded.  For more than two years Russia has been trying to take this city in order to advance further north and reach regional transportation hubs such as Kurakhove and Pokrovsk. Pro-Kremlin military bloggers had posted several videos the day before showing Russian soldiers with flags on rooftops of different buildings in Vuhledar. Donetsk regional authorities confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had almost reached the city centre, and some reports said Ukrainian forces are still hanging on in some districts. The BBC has spoken to two soldiers from the 72nd brigade who managed to leave the city before the final assault and take up new positions in the same area.  They claim that their troops have withdrawn from the city. Over the past few days Ukrainian soldiers had to find their own way out of Vuhledar by foot as it was impossible to evacuate them otherwise, a machine-gunner who wished to remain anonymous said. Many were wounded and killed by Russian drones and artillery as they tried to leave, another soldier, Roman, says. Many more are still missing. Moscow has launched numerous attacks to seize the city since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, but they all failed up until now. One of the biggest tank battles took place there last year. Instead of launching frontal assaults, the Russian army recently switched to its favourite tactic – advancing along the flanks to surround the target. Last month they seized the village of Prechystivka to the west and Vodyane to the east to complete a pincer movement. Moscow’s enormous advantage in weapons and troops  - some soldiers have estimated the ratio of forces as seven to one - enabled them to break through Ukrainian defence lines along the flanks and approach Vuhledar. It became clear that the city was doomed when the Russians effectively cut off the only remaining lifeline route – the road from Vuhledar to Bohoyavlenka. Russian troops advanced so close that their artillery and kamikaze drones targeted anyone and anything moving on that road. “We tried to send supplies, organise evacuation of our wounded and dead soldiers but without any success,” Roman said. “We lost a number of vehicles and then had to stop [such operations].” By Tuesday, about 100 civilians remained in Vuhledar, out of a pre-war population of 14,000, according to Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin. ""Thank God, we evacuated all children. Regarding the 107 people who are still there, it's difficult to reach them and bring them humanitarian aid, drinking water, medicine because an active stage of war is under way."" The situation became critical when Russian troops entered the city, and Ukrainian units started retreating without waiting for the order to pull out. “If a withdrawal is not organised, it ends up being chaotic,” the machine-gunner explained. Ukrainian defenders were like Titans trying to stop the Russians, he said.  But some groups, he added, had become completely disoriented because of a communication blackout. Their radios were down, and when they came under heavy fire, they had to make quick decisions on their own and often it was to retreat. Ukrainian defence lines were devastated by Russia’s aviation bombs and thermobaric weapon systems such as its Solntsepek heavy flame-thrower, in addition to drones and multiple rocket launchers. Facing such an onslaught, withdrawing from certain positions became unavoidable, Roman argued. “You either die or retreat.” But getting out from a city that had been nearly surrounded was extremely dangerous. During the daytime it became close to a suicide mission. Ukraine’s troops mostly tried to escape at night, having to cross mine fields via designated paths to avoid the road because it was closely monitored by the Russians. Until recently, evacuation vehicles had been able to drive in under cover of darkness with their headlights off, Roman explained. But once Russian troops had reached the centre of the city, the only way to escape was on foot. Those who managed to get out are exhausted and depressed. They are also angry at their commanders for not ordering the retreat earlier, because they argue it was obvious for some time that Ukrainian forces wouldn’t be able to hold the city for long. “I don’t know why [they didn’t give the order],” the machine-gunner said. “Maybe it’s fear of the military leadership or maybe it was an order from the top [to hold positions] with our blood until the very end.” Military officials from the 72nd brigade and Ukraine’s operational command in the area refused the BBC’s request to comment. In their most recent daily briefings, the military’s General Staff kept silent about Vuhledar.   Wednesday morning’s briefing said merely that the “the enemy launched unsuccessful attacks on our positions in Bohoyavlenka’s direction”, without mentioning the situation in Vuhledar at all."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810y11dyjo,Trump meets Zelensky and says it's time to end Russia's war,The last-minute meeting in New York comes amid Trump's increasing criticism of US funding for the war in Ukraine.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:54.874346,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump met Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky at his New York base in Trump Tower on Friday and said it was time Russia's war in Ukraine was settled. The Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly criticised the Ukrainian leader on the US campaign trail, and a meeting between the pair had seemed unlikely until hours before. As the two men stood side by side, Zelensky said he thought they had a ""common view that the war has to be stopped and Putin can't win"", adding that he would discuss with Trump details of his ""victory plan"". Despite years of differences, Trump insisted he had a very good relationship with Zelensky.   ""I also have a very good relationship as you know with President Putin and I think if we win [the election] we’re going to get it resolved very quickly,"" he said.  Afterwards, Trump and Zelensky spoke to Fox News and the former president said he “learned a lot” from the meeting. “We both want to see this end, and we both want to see a fair deal made,” he said. “It should stop and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop, and I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that’s a good combination.” Zelensky said: “Putin killed so many people and of course we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war. He’s on our territory.”  Zelensky invited Trump to visit Ukraine, and Trump replied: “I will”. The Ukrainian president later posted on his Telegram channel that the pair had a “very meaningful meeting”. “We have a common view that the war in Ukraine must be stopped. Putin cannot win. Ukrainians must win,” he wrote. Trump, meanwhile, said on his Truth Social account that if he is not elected president, ""that war will never end, and will phase into WORLD WAR III"".  The pair have long had a tumultuous relationship. Trump was impeached in 2019 over accusations that he pressured Zelensky to dig up damaging information on the Biden family. A rough transcript of the call revealed Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, as well as Biden's son Hunter. Standing beside Zelensky on Friday, he praised the Ukrainian leader's handling of the issue. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump has frequently repeated Moscow's talking points about the war. During September's presidential debate, he sidestepped a question on whether he wanted Ukraine to emerge victorious in the conflict.  Ahead of Friday's meeting, Trump repeated his long-standing claim that he would be able to ""work out something"" to settle the war if he won the presidential election, long before Joe Biden leaves office in January. He has refused to elaborate when asked whether he believes Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as a means of ending the war. Although Zelensky has been visiting the US since Sunday, their meeting was only confirmed on Thursday night, when Trump posted a screenshot of a text message from President Zelensky saying it was ""important for us to have a personal contact and to understand each other 100%"".  There have been tensions all week between Zelensky and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election. Some Republicans were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, with top Democrats, including state Governor Josh Shapiro, earlier this week.  Zelensky's trip to the key swing state was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event. In a public letter, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the visit was ""designed to help Democrats"" and claimed it amounted to ""election interference"". Trump has grown increasingly critical of continued US funding for Ukraine, and in recent days has sharpened his attacks against Zelensky, calling him the ""greatest salesman on Earth"" for continuing to obtain military aid. In contrast, Zelensky recently told the New Yorker magazine that he believes Trump ""doesn't really know how to stop the war"" and called Trump's running mate JD Vance ""too radical"" and ""dangerous"" for suggesting that Ukraine should give up territory to end the war, saying it would spark conflict around the world. When asked about Zelensky's comments on Thursday, Trump replied: ""I do believe I disagree with him. He doesn't know me."" On Thursday, Zelensky met US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his ""victory plan"", which he hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war. Hours before, Biden had announced a further $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine. As Zelensky visited the US, drone attacks continued in Ukraine. On Thursday night, three people were killed and 14 others wounded in a Russian drone attack on Izmail, a port city on the River Danube. Russia has targeted Izmail’s grain export facilities in the past. Prosecutors say two boys aged three and 13, and a girl aged 14, were among those wounded in the latest attack. Romania’s defence ministry said it was possible that one of the Russian drones involved in the attack had crossed the border into Romania, a Nato member state, for a very short period.

Authorities across Oxfordshire have come together as part of the county's Migration Partnership, to launch the Homes for Ukraine Grant Scheme. It offers funding of up to £2,000 to community organisations so they can fund projects and services supporting Ukrainians. Olha, who came to the UK after the Russian invasion with her two children and found a job with the council as a housing officer, said the scheme was ""a great starting point"". Cherwell District Council has partnered up with South Oxfordshire, Vale of White Horse and West Oxfordshire district councils, as well as Oxford City Council, for the initiative. It has been designed to support the ""successful integration and settlement"" of Ukrainians in their new communities, a council spokesperson explained. After settling into a host home in Oxford with her children in May 2022, Olha found a job working as a housing officer in the Ukrainian team at Vale of White Horse District Council. Her job involves assessing Ukrainians' needs and to help them when they need to find alternative accommodation.  Olha believes the new scheme will make a difference. ""One of the main differences between the rental market in the UK and Ukraine is that usually properties come furnished but here in the UK most of the properties are unfurnished,"" she said.  ""Obviously people who flee the war do not bring any furniture or bedding or cutlery with them, so they need to kit out their properties."" The council pays a £500 discretionary fund payment per person, but the grant scheme will work to offer extra support. Olha said: ""Having been through all this stress and situation myself, I understand Ukrainian people who come here and are at a loss, trying to find their feet here in the country and I'm doing my best to help them.  ""I consider the Homes for Ukraine programme to be a great starting point for people to move to another country and settle in, though we're still very unsure what will happen next with us but we are very grateful to be here, happy and safe."" The scheme is now open for applications and being administered by Cherwell District Council. You can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9lk4pz7vo,Ukraine says nine killed in Russia strikes on hospital,"Officials say Sumy's hospital was hit in the morning, and was struck again as rescuers were evacuating people.",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:25:55.105700,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Nine people have been killed in twin Russian drone strikes on a hospital in Ukraine's north-eastern city of Sumy, Ukrainian officials say. They say the building was hit on Saturday morning, and was struck again when rescuers were evacuating people. At least 12 people were injured in the attack that destroyed several floors of the hospital and triggered a fire. Ukraine's state emergencies service DSNS says 122 people have been evacuated. Sumy, about 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border, has seen almost daily Russian attacks in recent weeks.  The Saint Panteleimon hospital in Sumy was hit by Shahed kamikaze drones, Ukrainian officials say, adding that dozens of patients and staff were inside at the time. A nurse and a police officer who had been aiding the evacuation were among those killed in the strikes. The DSNS said three floors of the four-storey building, as well as the roof were partially destroyed. It said a fire that broke out after the strikes was later contained. Several residential buildings in the area were also damaged. Reacting to the Russian strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the world to ""pay attention to what Russia is targeting.  ""They are waging war on hospitals, civilian objects, and people’s lives,"" he said in a statement on social media. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In its latest operational update on Saturday, the Russian defence ministry says its forces carried out strikes on several Ukrainian brigades in the Sumy region.  The defence ministry did not comment on the reported hospital strikes. Sumy borders Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched its surprise incursion in August, capturing at least one town and a number of villages.  The apparent aim of the offensive was to halt Russia's advance in eastern Ukraine by redeploying troops to Kursk.  However, Russian troops have since claimed to have captured several villages in Ukraine's Donetsk region, and are now threatening a key town of Vuhledar.  Saturday's strikes come a day after Zelensky met Donald Trump in New York. The Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly criticised the Ukrainian leader on the US campaign trail, and a meeting between the pair had seemed unlikely until hours before. On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader met US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his ""victory plan"", which he hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rjxl7le1o,Fighting Russia - and low morale - on Ukraine's ‘most dangerous front line’,The BBC visits a key city under attack by Russia and finds eroded morale among its few remaining residents.,16 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:25:55.219522,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“This is the most dangerous of all front lines,” says Oleksandr, the head of a medical unit for the Ukrainian army's 25th Brigade. We are in the treatment room of a cramped makeshift field unit - the first point of treatment for injured soldiers. “The Russian Federation is pushing very hard. We have not been able to stabilise the front. Each time the front line moves, we also move.” We are close to Pokrovsk, a small mining city about 60km (37 miles) to the north-west of the regional capital, Donetsk. The medics tell us they recently treated 50 soldiers in one day - numbers rarely seen before during the course of this war. The casualties are brought in for treatment at this secret location after dusk, when there is less of a chance of being attacked by armed Russian drones. The Ukrainian troops have been injured in the ferocious battle to defend Pokrovsk. Just months ago, this was considered a relatively safe place - home to about 60,000 people, its streets lined with restaurants, cafes and markets. Soldiers would often come from the front line to the city for a break. Now, it feels like a ghost town. More than three-quarters of its population have left. Since Russia captured the city of Avdiivka in February, the speed of its advance in the Donestk region has been swift. At the start of October, it captured the key city of Vuhledar.  The Ukrainian government agrees with the soldiers we meet on the ground, that fighting around Pokrovsk is the most intense. “The Pokrovsk direction leads the number of enemy attacks,” Kyiv stated last week - claiming that, in total, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had repelled about 150 “enemy” attacks on most days in the past two weeks. In the field unit, six miles from the front, army medic Tania holds the arm of Serhii, a soldier with a bloodied bandage covering most of his face, and guides him into an examination room. “His condition is serious,” says Tania. Serhii has shrapnel injuries to one of his eyes, his skull and brain. The doctors quickly clean up his wounds and inject antibiotics. Five more soldiers arrive soon after - they are uncertain how they received their injuries. The barrage of fire can be so fierce and sudden, their wounds could have been caused by mortars or explosives dropped from drones. “It’s dangerous here. It is difficult, mentally and physically. We are all tired, but we are coping,” says Yuriy, the commander of all the brigade's medical units. All the soldiers we see were injured at different times of the morning, but they have only arrived after nightfall, when it is safer. Such delays can increase the risk of death and disability, we are told. Another soldier, Taras, has tied a tourniquet around his arm to stop the bleeding from a shrapnel wound, but now - more than 10 hours later - his arm looks swollen and pale and he can’t feel it. A doctor tells us it might have to be amputated. In the past 24 hours, two soldiers have been brought in dead. What we see at the field unit points to the ferocity of the battle for Pokrovsk - an important transport hub. The rail link that passes through was used regularly to evacuate civilians from front-line towns to safer parts of Ukraine, and to move supplies for the military. Ukraine knows what is at stake here. The threat of Russian drones is ever present - one hovers just outside the medical unit while we are there. It makes evacuations from the front line extremely hard. The building's windows are boarded up so the drones can't look inside, but the minute anyone steps out of the door, they are at risk of being hit. The drones are also a threat to the remaining citizens of Pokrovsk. “We constantly hear them buzzing - they stop and look inside the windows,” says Viktoriia Vasylevska, 50, one of the remaining, war-weary residents. But even she has now agreed to be evacuated from her home, on the particularly dangerous eastern edge of the city. She is surprised by how fast the front line has moved west towards Pokrovsk. “It all happened so quickly. Who knows what will happen here next. I’m losing my nerve. I have panic attacks. I’m afraid of the nights.” Viktoriia says she has barely any money and will have to start her life from scratch somewhere else, but it is too scary to stay here now. “I want the war to end. There should be negotiations. There is nothing left in the lands taken by Russia anyway. Everything is destroyed and all the people have fled,” she says. We find eroded morale among most of the people we speak to - the toll of more than two and a half years of a grinding war. Most of Pokrovsk is now without power and water. At a school, there is a queue of people carrying empty canisters waiting to use a communal tap. They tell us that a few days ago, four taps were working, but now they are down to just one. Driving through the streets, pockets of destruction are visible, but the city hasn’t yet been bombed out like others that have been fiercely fought over. We meet Larysa, 69, buying sacks of potatoes at one of a handful of food stalls still open at the otherwise shuttered-down central market. “I’m terrified. I can’t live without sedatives,” she says. On her small pension, she doesn't think she would be able to afford rent somewhere else. “The government might take me somewhere and shelter me for a while. But what after that?” Another shopper, 77-year-old Raisa chimes in. “You can’t go anywhere without money. So we just sit in our home and hope that this will end.” Larysa thinks it’s time to negotiate with Russia - a sentiment that might have been unthinkable for most in Ukraine some time ago. But at least here, near the front line, we found many voicing it. “So many of our boys are dying, so many are wounded. They’re sacrificing their lives, and this is going on and on,” she says. From a mattress on the floor of an evacuation van, 80-year-old Nadiia has no sympathy for the advancing Russian forces. “Damn this war! I’m going to die,” she wails. “Why does [President] Putin want more land? Doesn’t he have enough? He has killed so many people.” Nadiia can't walk. She used to drag herself around her house, relying on the help of neighbours. Just a handful of them have stayed back, but under the constant threat of bombardment, she has decided to leave even though she doesn’t know where she will go. But there are those who are not yet leaving town. Among them are locals working to repair war-damaged infrastructure. “I live on one of the streets closest to the front line. Everything is burnt out around my house. My neighbours died after their home was shelled,” Vitaliy tells us, as he and his co-workers try to fix electrical lines. “But I don’t think it’s right to abandon our men. We have to fight until we have victory and Russia is punished for its crimes.” His resolve is not shared by 20-year-old Roman, who we meet while he is working to fix a shell-damaged home. “I don’t think the territory we’re fighting for is worth human lives. Lots of our soldiers have died. Young men who could have had a future, wives and children. But they had to go to the front line.” At dawn one morning, we drive towards the battlefield outside the city. Fields of dried sunflowers line the sides of the roads. There is barely any cover, and so we drive at breakneck speed in order to protect ourselves against Russian drone attacks. We hear loud explosions as we near the front line. At a Ukrainian artillery position, Vadym fires a Soviet-era artillery gun. It emits a deafening sound and blows dust and dried leaves off the ground. He runs to shelter in an underground bunker, keeping safe from Russian retaliation and waiting for the coordinates of the next Ukrainian strike. “They [Russia] have more manpower and weapons. And they send their men onto the battlefield like they’re canon fodder,” he says. But he knows that if Pokrovsk falls, it could open a gateway to the Dnipro region - just 32km (20 miles) from Pokrovsk - and their job will become even more difficult. “Yes, we are tired - and many of our men have died and been wounded - but we have to fight, otherwise the result will be catastrophic.” Additional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Anastasiia Levchenko, Volodymyr Lozhko, Sanjay Ganguly"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e15yr1gwo,"Russia on mission to cause mayhem on UK streets, warns MI5","In a wide-ranging speech, Ken McCallum also revealed MI5 had responded to 20 plots backed by Iran since 2022.",6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:05.353459,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia's intelligence agency has been on a mission to generate ""sustained mayhem on British and European streets"", the head of MI5 has said. Giving his annual update on security threats faced by the UK, Ken McCallum said GRU agents had carried out ""arson, sabotage and more dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness"" in Britain after the UK backed Ukraine in its war with Russia. MI5 had also responded to 20 plots backed by Iran since 2022, he said, although he added the majority of its work still mostly involved Islamist extremism followed by extreme right-wing terrorism. The complex mix of terror-related threats and threats from nation states meant MI5 had ""one hell of a job on its hands"", he warned. In a wide-ranging speech, he said: There was a ""dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies"" MI5 had to deal with, he told the briefing at MI5's counter-terrorism operations centre in London. ""The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats.  ""We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war,"" he said.  The UK's ""leading role"" in supporting Ukraine means ""we loom large in the fevered imagination of Putin's regime"" and further acts of aggression on UK soil should be expected, he warned. The UK's current terror threat level is substantial - meaning an attack is likely. More than 750 Russian diplomats had been expelled from Europe since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ""the great majority of them"" spies, Mr McCallum said. This affected the Russian intelligence services' capability, he explained, and added that diplomatic visas had been denied to those who Britain and allies considered Russian spies. Russian state actors turned to proxies, such as private intelligence operatives and criminals, to do ""their dirty work"", but this affected the professionalism of their operations and made them easier to disrupt. While Mr McCallum has spoken publicly before about both the Russian and Iranian threats, he has not previously accused Moscow in such stark terms.  On Iran, he said the 20 Iran-backed plots MI5 had responded to presented ""potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents"". He said that since the 2022 killing of Mahsa Amini - the 22-year-old who died in Iranian police custody after being arrested for allegedly violating rules requiring women to wear the headscarf - ""we’ve seen plot after plot here in the UK, at an unprecedented pace and scale"". In a previous public address he referred to 10 plots against Iranians in the UK. That number has now doubled, implying that Iranian state activity is undeterred by the threat of being caught.  He added that, as the war in the Middle East continues, MI5 would give its ""fullest attention to the risk of an increase in – or a broadening of – Iranian state aggression in the UK"". In both cases, Russia and Iran, the MI5 boss stressed that because it was difficult - to almost impossible - for their accredited diplomats to carry out such actions, they were turning increasingly to underworld criminal gangs. In response, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said that Tehran rejects ""accusations"" put forward by Mr McCallum. Speaking about China, the head of MI5 said the economic relationship with the UK helped to underpin security. However, he later told reporters the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had a programme to steal data and information, and ""we have seen 20,000 obfuscated approaches to individuals by China"". The number of young people being drawn into online extremism is growing, Mr McCallum warned.  About 13% of those investigated for involvement in terrorism were under 18 - a threefold increase in the last three years. The security agency was seeing ""far too many cases where very young people are being drawn into poisonous online extremism"". ""Extreme right-wing terrorism in particular skews heavily towards young people, driven by propaganda that shows a canny understanding of online culture,"" he said. Responding to questions from reporters, he reiterated concerns about the role of the internet being the ""biggest factor"" driving the trend, and described how easily youngsters could access material from their bedrooms. A high proportion of the threat was made up by “lone individuals indoctrinated online"" he said. “In dark corners of the internet, talk is cheap. Sorting the real plotters from armchair extremists is an exacting task,” he said. “Anonymous online connections are often inconsequential, but a minority lead to deadly, real world actions.” Home Office figures published last month show that of 242 people detained on suspicion of terror offences in the year to June, 17% (40) were aged 17 and under.  Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the ""sober findings"" outlined by Mr McCallum but said the public should be ""reassured that our security services are world class and will do everything necessary to keep us safe""."

Yulianna Skakun moved from the war-torn country to Rugby, Warwickshire before starting her course this week at the University of Northampton. Russia launched its full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the country still under regular bombardment from Russia. The student said her journey to the UK was ""very stressful but I had a purpose... to get an education"". Since the outbreak of the war more than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have moved to the UK. Ms Skakun said she had first travelled from her home in western Ukraine to Poland before heading to England which she said was a ""tough way"". The 18-year-old described how living in the UK was a ""cultural shock - generally everything is different"". After arriving in Rugby she took A-levels in politics, business, and English and also completed her final exams in Ukraine online.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9580kgp09o,"No imminent nuclear threat from Russia, says new Nato chief","Mark Rutte slammed the Kremlin's ""reckless and irresponsible"" rhetoric but downplayed Russia's nuclear threats.",1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:05.571918,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Mark Rutte, the new secretary general of Nato, said he does not see any imminent threat of nuclear weapons being used by Russia despite ""reckless and irresponsible"" rhetoric by the Kremlin. Last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was considering changing its military doctrine to regard an attack from a non-nuclear state - such as Ukraine - that was backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a ""joint attack"".  Putin's comments came as Ukraine sought approval to use long-range Western missiles against military sites in Russia.  The former Dutch prime minister was speaking at his first press conference since taking over as head of the military alliance.  Rutte said that while he supported Ukraine’s right to carry out such strikes, it was up to allies to lift restrictions and called for Nato countries to continue arming Ukraine, saying that ""the more we help Ukraine at the moment, the sooner [the war] will end.""  ""The cost of supporting Ukraine is far, far lower, than the cost we would face if we allow Putin to get his way,"" Rutte said, reiterating his predecessor's commitment to bringing Ukraine closer to Nato membership. He acknowledged that the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine - where Russia is making slow but steady progress - was ""difficult"".  However, Rutte also pointed out that Russia's gains were limited and had come at a high cost, quoting estimates that 1,000 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day. At his first press conference as Nato chief, Rutte said the three priorities for his term as secretary general would be to support Ukraine, to bolster Nato's collective deterrence and to build relationships in other parts of the world, such as the Indo-Pacific. When asked about former US president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump - who had a fractious relationship with Nato - Rutte praised him for persuading more allies to spend more on defence and for highlighting the challenge posed by Russia.  ""He was the one pushing us to spend more,"" Rutte said, and pointed out that Nato member countries currently are at a much higher spending level than when Trump took office in 2017.  He also said that Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, was a ""highly respected leader"" and vowed to work with whoever will win the US presidential election next month. Like his predecessor, Rutte called for Nato countries to spend more and acknowledged that the Netherlands should have reached the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence sooner. Mark Rutte, 57, was prime minister of the Netherlands until he stepped down earlier this year following the collapse of his coalition government in 2023. In June, he was appointed as the next secretary general of Nato.  The term normally lasts four years, but Rutte's predecessor, the Norwegian economist and former prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, ended up staying in post for ten years.  Over that decade, Nato went from the ""brain death"" French President Emmanuel Macron warned about in 2019 to a revamped military alliance that now counts Sweden and Finland among its members. In a final farewell message before leaving the job on Tuesday, Stoltenberg said that the last ten years had been ""momentous"". Wishing Mark Rutte good luck, he said he was sure that Nato was in safe hands."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zpy3zj7ro,Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election,People in Beijing tell the BBC's Laura Bicker their hopes and fears about who will win the White House race.,12 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:26:05.792381,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"In China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House. “None of us wants to see a war,” says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner. He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors.  They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China. In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds. It comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high. “I am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,” says Mr Xiang who’s in his sixties. Peace is what we want, he adds. A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble. They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election. “Although he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine’s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,” he said. Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. “Donald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,” says one.  “About Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.” Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media. China has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its “Arab brothers” in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel. On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a “constructive role” as he accused Washington of “exploiting the situation for selfish gain”. While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country’s leaders. But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan. “I don’t like Trump. I don’t think there is a good future between the US and China – there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,” says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out. He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict. “I don’t want it. I don’t want my son to go to the military,” he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi has said “reunification is inevitable”, vowing to retake it by force if necessary. The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a “commitment to security and prosperity for all nations.” Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection. “Taiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They’re immensely wealthy,” he said in a recent interview. “Taiwan should pay us for defence.” One of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn. Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump.  President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electronic vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.  “I don’t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,” says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people. Many of the the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power too. In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship. “Our country is a very prosperous and powerful country,” they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America. Taylor Swift is on their playlists too. Others like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day. As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation. Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. “Harris’s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it’s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.” The People’s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that makes up the most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800. Xi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously. He said that on dozens of occasions the security forces or a government ministry have prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US. On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials. Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China. “We may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,” she says as she heads off to join her family.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07n811zyp2o,Zelensky looks to Biden to back Ukraine 'victory plan',Kyiv is hoping for a strong show of support from the US leader before he leaves the White House.,25 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:05.911923,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"As Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to reveal a “victory plan” to President Joe Biden on Thursday, Kyiv is looking to the US leader for a strong show of support before he leaves the White House. A senior official in Kyiv said they wanted him to “make history” in his final months in office. While details of the Ukrainian plan have been kept under wraps, the strategy is likely to contain pleas for further military and financial support, plus future security guarantees. Zelensky says it is designed to be a “bridge” towards stopping the war, which he believes could end sooner than people think. If the West strengthens Ukraine’s position, he argues Russia’s Vladimir Putin could be pushed into a diplomatic peace. ""This war can't be calmed by talks. Action is needed,"" he told the UN Security Council late on Tuesday. Ever sharp at public relations, Ukraine’s president is also aiming to take on critics in the US who have questioned the wisdom of pouring further money into Ukraine’s cause – by promoting an apparent blueprint for eventual peace. Zelensky is throwing a huge diplomatic effort behind his victory plan.  He is almost camped out at the United Nations. He spoke on Monday at a debate about how the UN should be reformed. He addressed the Security Council on Tuesday. And he is giving a speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday.  In between, he is meeting world leaders and US politicians. He visited an ammunition factory in Scranton, Joe Biden’s hometown in Pennsylvania, one that is making shells for Ukrainian artillery batteries.  And he is explicit that he considers time is short. In one of his many media interviews, Zelensky told the New Yorker that the victory plan had to be agreed - and Ukraine strengthened - in October, November and December.  “This plan is designed, first and foremost, with Biden’s support in mind,” he told the magazine. That support is by no means guaranteed but Zelensky is staking much on securing it.  That is because the situation will change significantly if Donald Trump were to win the election. At a campaign rally on Monday, the former president mocked Zelensky as “the greatest salesman in history” because “every time he comes into this country, he walks away with $60bn”.  Trump restated his position that he would urge Russia and Ukraine to agree a deal to end the war, one that Kyiv fears would force them to accept territorial losses and no guarantee against further Russian aggression.  It is the fear of such a scenario that is pushing the diplomatic drive behind Zelensky’s victory plan this week. Some diplomats are sceptical the plan would succeed in nudging Russia towards a negotiating table. Much depends now on Biden’s response. Congressional lawmakers will be handed the plan as will Trump and his presidential rival Kamala Harris. Trump has claimed he would end the war within 24 hours, leading to fears the Republican nominee would essentially force Kyiv into making territorial concessions against its will. As the US elections loom, it’s a crucial moment for Zelensky as Moscow’s troops continue to press gains, inch by inch, in Ukraine’s east. A top priority in the so-called victory plan will be to “hit Russia strongly”, believes one military analyst - Mykhailo Samus, director of the New Geopolitics Research Network. Giving Kyiv the ability to destroy military infrastructure within a 300km range could seriously hamper the Kremlin’s offensive operations in the Donbas and its ability to “neutralise” Ukraine’s ongoing incursion in Russia’s Kursk region, says Mr Samus. This would mean securing permission, so far denied, to use Western-made long-range missiles on targets deep inside Russia. While Ukraine has successfully been deploying attack drones against Russian ammunition dumps, missiles can penetrate more heavily fortified munition sites. The plan will also see Kyiv ask for more of these kinds of missiles, believes Olga Rudenko, editor in chief of the Kyiv Independent. Further financial support and capitalising on Ukraine’s surprise cross-border push into Russia’s Kursk region are also expected to form core elements within the strategy. As for Ukraine’s future security guarantees, Ukraine’s aspirations towards joining the Nato defensive military alliance clearly remain. “Ukraine’s invitation to Nato is part of the victory plan,” confirmed Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office. Zelensky’s office has rejected a German report that he is considering a localised ceasefire as “fake”. However, Czech President Petr Pavel – who has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine – said this week that part of Ukraine would probably remain “temporarily” occupied, possibly for years. Olga Rudenko believes that, for most Ukrainians, it’s still “too sensitive and unimaginable to concede anything even temporarily to Russia” – even if that conversation is happening somewhere, privately, within government. “It’s not that Ukrainians are greedy about the territory,” she says. “We can’t leave our people there, under Russian control and sentence them to those horrors,” referring to persistent allegations of Russian war crimes. That sentiment was echoed by 31-year-old Dmytro, whose face and arms were badly burned when he was hit by a Russian drone. “We will not surrender our territories, for which so many people have been fallen,” he told the BBC in Kyiv. “If we ended the war at this stage, what were we fighting for then? What for did all our men, our comrades die for?” A truce, he believes, would simply give Russia time to recuperate and Zelensky has likewise warned against a ""frozen"" conflict. Dmytro is already planning his return to the front line to fight alongside his comrades: “I will not retreat, I will be there until my last breath.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0g29w45p1o,"Ukrainian journalist, 27, who chronicled Russian occupation dies in prison",Viktoriia Roshchyna had been detained last year while reporting in Russian-occupied Ukraine.,2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:06.026189,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Viktoriia Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 in a part of Ukraine now occupied by Russian forces.  It took nine months for Russian authorities to confirm the journalist had been detained. They gave no reason. This week, her father got a terse letter from the defence ministry in Moscow informing him that Viktoriia was dead, aged 27. The document said the journalist’s body would be returned in one of the swaps organised by Russia and Ukraine for soldiers killed on the battlefield. The death date was given as 19 September. Again, there was no explanation. This weekend, friends gathered to remember Viktoriia on the Maidan in central Kyiv. They shuffled into position on the steps holding her photograph, young face smiling out at the small crowd. “She had huge courage,” one woman began the tributes.  “We will miss her enormously,” said another, turning away as her eyes filled with tears. Viktoriia’s stories were snapshots of life that Ukrainians were not getting from anywhere else.  Reporting from occupied areas of Ukraine was extremely dangerous, but her colleagues remember how she was desperate to go there, even after she was detained and held in custody the first time, for ten days. “Her parents used to call and tell us to stop deploying her, but we never did deploy her!” one of her former bosses recalled.  “All her editors tried to stop her. But it was impossible.” The young reporter eventually went freelance in order to deploy herself and when she got back newspapers would buy her reports. Most strikingly, she never used a pseudonym even though she wrote openly of ""occupied"" territory and referred to those who collaborated with the Russians as ""traitors"".  “She wanted to provide information about how those cities live under siege by the Russian army,” Sevgil Musaieva, editor-in-chief at Ukrayinska Pravda, told the BBC. “She was absolutely amazing.” Viktoriia's father has previously described how she set out via Poland and Russia last July, heading for occupied Ukraine. It was a week before she called to say she’d been interrogated at the border for several days. All we know for sure after that, is that by May she was in Detention Centre No. 2 in Taganrog, southern Russia – a facility so notorious for the brutal treatment of many Ukrainians that some dub it the ""Russian Guantanamo"". According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, another Ukrainian citizen who was released from Taganrog last month has told Viktoriia’s family she saw the journalist on 8 or 9 September. Then, there was cause for hope.  “I was 100% sure she’d be back on 13 September this year. My sources gave me 100% guarantees,” Musaieva, from Ukrayinska Pravda, says. She had been told Viktoriia would be included in one of the periodic prisoner-of-war swaps that Ukraine and Russia carry out, planned for the middle of last month. “So what happened with her in prison? Why didn’t she come home?” Viktoriia was moved, with another Ukrainian woman, but neither were included in the prisoner exchange. “That means she was taken somewhere else,"" says Media Initiative director Tetyana Katrychenko. ""They say to Lefortovo. Why there? We don’t know."" She says it’s not normal practice ahead of a swap. Lefortovo prison in Moscow is run by the FSB security service and used for those accused of espionage and serious crimes against the state. “Maybe they took her there to start some kind of court proceeding or investigation. That’s happened to other civilians taken from Kherson and Melitopol,” Tetyana says. The BBC understands that Viktoriia’s father had spoken to her in prison on 30 August. At some point, she had called a hunger strike, but that day her father urged her to start eating again and she agreed. “That needs investigating. It also means we’d be blaming her, partially, and not the Russian Federation, as we should,” Tetyana cautions. Ukraine’s intelligence service has confirmed Viktoriia’s death and the General Prosecutor’s office has changed its criminal case from illegal detention to murder.  In Russia, Viktoriia was never charged with any crime and the circumstances of her detention are not known. “A civilian journalist … captured by Russia. Then Russia sends a letter that she died?” Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn told the BBC in Kyiv. “It's killing. Just the killing of hostages. I don't know other word.” Russia hasn't commented. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, huge numbers of civilians have been taken from areas of Ukraine that Moscow has overrun and now controls. Like Viktoriia’s family, desperate relatives are left with little or no information on their whereabouts or wellbeing, and no idea whether they’ll ever get home. So far, the Media Initiative has collated a list of 1,886 names. ""There’s all sorts of people, including ex-soldiers and police officers and local officials like mayors,” Tetyana says.  “And of course there may be many more we don’t know about.” Neither lawyers nor the Red Cross get access and even if someone’s location can be confirmed, getting them back home is almost impossible: civilians are rarely swapped. Viktoriia’s friends and colleagues say they won’t rest until they’ve investigated what happened. “Her life was her work,” Angelina Karyakina, a former editor at Hromadske says. “It's a rare type of people who are so determined.” “I'm pretty sure the way she would want us to remember her is not to stand here and cry, but to remember her dignity,” she says. “And I think what’s important for us journalists, is to find out what she was working on – and to finish her story.”"

Former soldier Ben Remfrey, who has been clearing mines and other ordnances in the country, has been awarded an official Cross of Support to Ukraine. He co-founded Friends of Ukraine-EOD, a charity aimed at training Ukrainians in clearing unexploded mines. Mr Remfrey said the award followed months of ""tireless dedication and work since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine"".  He said they had trained over 400 Ukrainians to international clearance standards. ""Being the head of the organisation, it's always nice to have recognition but I'm acutely aware that the award goes to the entire organisation as well as myself."" Mr Remfrey said his training had to be progressive and had changed as the war continued. ""There is no zero to hero in terms of being trained... ""People have to understand that there are a lot of land service ammunitions like hand grenades and mortars which are knocking around, but there are also large missiles and other abandoned ammunition storages.  ""All of these areas have to be addressed differently and the process has to be as safe as possible."" Mr Remfrey moves between his training facility in Kosovo and working in Ukraine. He said he has noticed a difference in the mood of Ukrainians as time had passed.  ""Initially I expect everybody would understand that when your country has been invaded by the Russian Federation, there's a lot of fear and a lot of uncertainly. ""The longer the war has gone on, the more confident the Ukrainians have become."" He said as the war continued, the amount of work needed to safely dispose of ammunition and explosives would increase.  ""While I'm very supportive of the military and the award is from the military, I'm also aware that we have to be involved with all groups because Ukraine is the most heavily contaminated country on Earth now in terms of explosive remanence of war.

He said he had received intelligence showing Moscow was using satellites provided by other countries to gather information about Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure.  ""Radiation does not respect state borders and many nations could feel a devastating effect,” he warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.  Russia has repeatedly targeted energy facilities across Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.  ""Any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster - a day like that must never come,"" Zelensky said. ""Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor. ""These are nuclear power plants. They must be safe."" The UN nuclear watchdog warned last month that safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating.  It followed a strike near the site's perimeter, close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line.  The plant was seized by Russian forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks, which both sides have blamed the other for. Zelensky said in his speech on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed all of Ukraine’s thermal power plants and a large part of its hydroelectric capacity as a way to “torment” Ukrainians ahead of winter. ""Energy must stop being used as a weapon,"" he said. A major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes in April, and millions of Ukrainians have suffered blackouts this year alone. While in the United States, Zelensky says he plans to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.  An official on Donald Trump's campaign said the Republican nominee would not meet the Ukrainian leader - despite statements from officials in Kyiv last week saying Zelensky was planning to see the former president. Trump described Zelensky as the ""greatest salesman on Earth"" following his speech and claimed the US would be ""stuck in that war"" unless he was elected in November. Also in his UN speech, Zelensky criticised China and Brazil for pushing for talks with Russia, questioning their motivations. He made a renewed appeal for countries to back his proposals for a full and just peace, reiterating his position that Russian forces needed to withdraw from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders to bring an end to the war.  Ukraine would not accept a return to a ""brutal, colonial past"", he added."

Trump has claimed he would end the war within 24 hours, leading to fears the Republican nominee would essentially force Kyiv into making territorial concessions against its will. As the US elections loom, it’s a crucial moment for Zelensky as Moscow’s troops continue to press gains, inch by inch, in Ukraine’s east. A top priority in the so-called victory plan will be to “hit Russia strongly”, believes one military analyst - Mykhailo Samus, director of the New Geopolitics Research Network. Giving Kyiv the ability to destroy military infrastructure within a 300km range could seriously hamper the Kremlin’s offensive operations in the Donbas and its ability to “neutralise” Ukraine’s ongoing incursion in Russia’s Kursk region, says Mr Samus. This would mean securing permission, so far denied, to use Western-made long-range missiles on targets deep inside Russia. While Ukraine has successfully been deploying attack drones against Russian ammunition dumps, missiles can penetrate more heavily fortified munition sites. The plan will also see Kyiv ask for more of these kinds of missiles, believes Olga Rudenko, editor in chief of the Kyiv Independent. Further financial support and capitalising on Ukraine’s surprise cross-border push into Russia’s Kursk region are also expected to form core elements within the strategy. As for Ukraine’s future security guarantees, Ukraine’s aspirations towards joining the Nato defensive military alliance clearly remain. “Ukraine’s invitation to Nato is part of the victory plan,” confirmed Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office. Zelensky’s office has rejected a German report that he is considering a localised ceasefire as “fake”. However, Czech President Petr Pavel – who has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine – said this week that part of Ukraine would probably remain “temporarily” occupied, possibly for years. Olga Rudenko believes that, for most Ukrainians, it’s still “too sensitive and unimaginable to concede anything even temporarily to Russia” – even if that conversation is happening somewhere, privately, within government. “It’s not that Ukrainians are greedy about the territory,” she says. “We can’t leave our people there, under Russian control and sentence them to those horrors,” referring to persistent allegations of Russian war crimes. That sentiment was echoed by 31-year-old Dmytro, whose face and arms were badly burned when he was hit by a Russian drone. “We will not surrender our territories, for which so many people have been fallen,” he told the BBC in Kyiv. “If we ended the war at this stage, what were we fighting for then? What for did all our men, our comrades die for?” A truce, he believes, would simply give Russia time to recuperate and Zelensky has likewise warned against a ""frozen"" conflict. Dmytro is already planning his return to the front line to fight alongside his comrades: “I will not retreat, I will be there until my last breath.”"

Zelensky also intends to present the plan to Congress and the two candidates in the US presidential election: Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. He is expected to ramp up efforts to persuade the US and its allies to allow Ukraine to fire the missiles they supplied deep into Russian territory for the first time in the war. Zelensky's visit to the US coincides with efforts from the White House to prepare a new $375m (£283m) military aid package for Ukraine. This autumn would ""determine the future of this war,"" Zelensky wrote in a post on X. In a statement ahead of the visit, the Ukrainian leader previewed three elements to his plan: further weapons donations, diplomatic efforts to force Russia to agree to peace, and holding Moscow accountable for its full-scale invasion in 2022. Ukraine has been pleading for months for the US, UK and other Western allies to ease restrictions on the use of long-range missiles so it can strike targets in Russia  which Kyiv says are used to launch attacks. Earlier in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Western countries that he would consider long-range missile strikes to be ""direct participation"" by the Nato military alliance in the war. When asked by reporters on Sunday whether he had made a decision on allowing Ukraine to use US-made long-range weapons, Biden answered: ""No."" Trump has previously criticised US support for Ukraine and spoken highly of Putin, but said he would ""probably"" meet Zelensky. The ex-president previously flagged his own plan to end the war ""within 24 hours"" if re-elected in November, but has not given details. According to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who he met in March, Trump has vowed to ""not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war. That is why the war will end"". Zelensky's statement also voiced gratitude for the support from Ukraine's allies to date, singling out the US in particular as its ""leading supporter"". The US has been the largest foreign donor to Ukraine, and to date has provided $56bn for its defence.  After arriving in the US on Sunday, Zelensky stopped in Biden's birth town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to visit a munitions factory involved in supplying the Ukrainian war effort. After Washington, Zelensky is expected to head to New York and the United Nations for a planned meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday and a speech at the General Assembly on Wednesday."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9lg50gndo,"Biden was right to stand aside in critical election, Clinton says","The former presidential hopeful tells the BBC ""the future of democracy is at stake"" in November's vote.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:12.537244,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Hillary Clinton has told the BBC that Joe Biden was right to stand aside in the US presidential election after his stumbling debate performance against Donald Trump earlier this year. ""Once that debate happened, he could not recover and he did the right thing,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. She also said Democrats had not been effective in telling Trump supporters what they were doing to address their economic concerns.  In 2016, the former US secretary of state was unexpectedly defeated by Trump, who now faces Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November's election, which polls suggest is extremely tight. She said she saw Joe Biden a week before the debate and saw no reason then why he should step down but that all changed. Clinton also said the future of democracy is at stake in this election and called on Harris to ""defeat Donald Trump to break the fever that he has caused in our political system"". ""The two candidates have presented extremely different agendas for where they want to take our country,"" Clinton said in the BBC interview, which came as she promotes her new memoir. Trump has rejected the notion that he is a threat and said the real threat comes from the Democratic Party.   The election, Clinton said, would have repercussions far beyond the US including ""whether or not we continue supporting Ukraine, whether we can get some kind of workable resolution in the Middle East and so much else"". Trump has previously indicated that he would cut US aid for Ukraine. After meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Friday, the former US president said he had ""a very good relationship"" with both Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.  “We both want to see a fair deal made,"" Trump said. The war, he added, ""should stop and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop, and I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop and that’s a good combination.” Clinton, who served as secretary of state in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, also criticised Trump's promise to begin a mass deportation of illegal immigrants if elected. ""Let's start with one million,” his vice-presidential pick JD Vance said of the plan in August. “That's where Kamala Harris has failed. And then we can go from there.” ""He is going to have a military presence [in US cities] to achieve his goals,"" Clinton said on Monday. ""If you look a certain way, if you talk a certain way, you will be subject to these Draconian measures."" When asked what drives Trump's support, she told the BBC that ""people support him for different reasons"" including feeling ""overlooked"" and ""unseen"" or that the ""economy doesn't work for them"". ""I think our problem is frankly we are not the most effective messengers,"" she said of the Democratic Party. ""About what we see and what we’re trying to do to address these real and legitimate concerns that people have. I recognise and accept my share of the responsibility."" The expectation upon politicians to be entertaining or outrageous in a social media age makes it harder to ""do the hard, boring work of actually getting things done,"" she added. Polling suggests Trump is more trusted on the election's biggest issue, the economy. The election will be held on 5 November and the new president will take office in January. Polls are currently very tight in the seven states considered as crucial in the contest, with just one or two percentage points separating the two candidates. Clinton, 76, was the first woman nominee for president from a major political party when she ran against Trump in 2016. Her husband, Bill Clinton, whom she married in 1975, was president from 1993 until 2001."

He said he had received intelligence showing Moscow was using satellites provided by other countries to gather information about Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure.  ""Radiation does not respect state borders and many nations could feel a devastating effect,” he warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.  Russia has repeatedly targeted energy facilities across Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.  ""Any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster - a day like that must never come,"" Zelensky said. ""Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor. ""These are nuclear power plants. They must be safe."" The UN nuclear watchdog warned last month that safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating.  It followed a strike near the site's perimeter, close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line.  The plant was seized by Russian forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks, which both sides have blamed the other for. Zelensky said in his speech on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed all of Ukraine’s thermal power plants and a large part of its hydroelectric capacity as a way to “torment” Ukrainians ahead of winter. ""Energy must stop being used as a weapon,"" he said. A major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes in April, and millions of Ukrainians have suffered blackouts this year alone. While in the United States, Zelensky says he plans to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.  An official on Donald Trump's campaign said the Republican nominee would not meet the Ukrainian leader - despite statements from officials in Kyiv last week saying Zelensky was planning to see the former president. Trump described Zelensky as the ""greatest salesman on Earth"" following his speech and claimed the US would be ""stuck in that war"" unless he was elected in November. Also in his UN speech, Zelensky criticised China and Brazil for pushing for talks with Russia, questioning their motivations. He made a renewed appeal for countries to back his proposals for a full and just peace, reiterating his position that Russian forces needed to withdraw from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders to bring an end to the war.  Ukraine would not accept a return to a ""brutal, colonial past"", he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yjej0rvw0o,Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons,Russia's leader says strikes by a non-nuclear state aided by a nuclear power can be considered a joint attack,26 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:12.818232,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Vladimir Putin says Russia would consider an attack from a non-nuclear state that was backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a ""joint attack"", in what could be construed as a threat to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. In key remarks on Wednesday night, the Russian president said his government was considering changing the rules and preconditions around which Russia would use its nuclear arsenal. Ukraine is a non-nuclear state that receives military support from the US and other nuclear-armed countries. His comments come as Kyiv seeks approval to use long-range Western missiles against military sites in Russia. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to the US this week and is due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday, where Kyiv's request is expected to be top of the agenda. Ukraine has pushed into Russian territory this year and wants to target bases inside Russia which it says are sending missiles into Ukraine. Responding to Putin's remarks, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Russia ""no longer has anything other than nuclear blackmail to intimidate the world"". Putin has threatened the use of nuclear weapons before. Ukraine has criticised it as  ""nuclear sabre-rattling"" to deter its allies from providing further support.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the comments as ""totally irresponsible"" in an MSNBC television interview. Russian ally China has also called for calm, with reports President Xi Jinping has warned Putin against using nuclear arms. But on Wednesday, after a meeting with his Security Council, Putin announced the proposed radical expansion. A new nuclear doctrine would ""clearly set the conditions for Russia to transition to using nuclear weapons,"" he warned - and said such scenarios included conventional missile strikes against Moscow. He said that Russia would consider such a ""possibility"" of using nuclear weapons if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft and drones into its territory, which presented a ""critical threat"" to the country's sovereignty. He added: ""It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation."" The country's nuclear arms were ""the most important guarantee of security of our state and its citizens"", the Kremlin leader said. Since the end of World War Two, nuclear-armed states have engaged in a policy of deterrence, which is based on the idea that if warring states were to launch major nuclear strikes it would lead to mutually assured destruction. But there are also tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout. In June, Putin delivered a warning to European countries supporting Ukraine, saying Russia had “many more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.” “Europe does not have a developed [early warning system],” he added. “In this sense they are more or less defenceless.” At the time he had hinted of changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine - the document which sets out the conditions under which Moscow would use nuclear weapons. The Kremlin said on Thursday that changes outlined by Putin should be considered a warning to the West. Elaborating on the move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""It must be considered a specific signal - a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear."" Peskov said that Russia would make a decision on whether not to publish the updated nuclear documents, adding that adjustments to the document on state nuclear deterrence were being formulated."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx250ygn9ddo,Oil price rise comes at a critical point,Any extended rise raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and gas and electricity bills.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:12.940629,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The price of oil has jumped 5% after US President Joe Biden said the US was discussing possible strikes by Israel on Iran’s oil industry. Asked on a visit if he would support Israel striking Iran’s oil facilities, Biden said: “We’re discussing that."" Iran is the seventh largest oil producer in the world, exporting around half its production abroad, mainly to China. Since Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Monday, the price of benchmark Brent crude oil has risen 10% to $77 a barrel, although this remains below levels seen earlier this year. Any extended rise in energy prices raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and increased gas and electricity bills, pushing up the rate of inflation. So far this year, weaker demand from China and ample supply from Saudi Arabia have acted to hold down oil prices. The reaction in oil markets has, so far, been far more muted than, for example, to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But the escalation of violence in the Middle East and threat of further action is now stalking the markets. Of particular concern is whether any escalation could block the Straits of Hormuz, through which a third of oil tanker traffic and a fifth of LNG frozen gas has to pass. Since Russia’s war with Ukraine began, the world has become more dependent on shipped frozen gas in LNG tankers. Even if it is Asia that is most physically dependent on the flow of oil and gas out of the Persian Gulf, the immediate price impact of such developments would be significant. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Thursday of the “very serious” potential impact and that he was watching developments “extremely closely”. All this could come at the very moment the world’s central bankers declared a quiet victory over the three-year inflation shock from the pandemic and Ukraine war. It may help explain why G7 leaders are trying to moderate the expected response from Israel to Iran’s attack."

""I think that we are closer to peace than we think,"" he told US broadcaster ABC News. He added that Ukraine could push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the conflict, but only if Kyiv was coming from a ""strong position"" - once again calling on his Western allies to strengthen the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainian president is in the US this week to speak at the United Nations General Assembly and to present what he has called a ""victory plan"" to his Western allies, including US President Joe Biden. In a statement ahead of the visit, Zelensky said the plan included further weapons donations, diplomatic efforts to force Russia to agree to peace, and holding Moscow accountable for its full-scale invasion in 2022. In his interview with ABC News, Zelensky said his victory plan was not about negotiating with Russia, but rather it was ""a bridge to a diplomatic way out, to stop the war"". On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was being cautious about media reports of a Ukrainian plan and added that the conflict would only end when Russia's aims were achieved. Zelensky has for some time been asking Western countries to allow Ukraine to ease restrictions on the use of long-range missiles which could be used to strike deep into Russia. He is expected to do so again this week as he visits the US.  On Sunday, Biden said he had not yet decided whether to give Ukraine the green light. Zelensky said the US would need to lead the decision: ""Everybody's looking up to [Biden], and we need this to defend ourselves,"" he told ABC. Zelensky will speak at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday and is also due to meet US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.  The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, told the New York Times that Ukraine would have to be ""realistic"" about its prospects of recovering the areas in the east of the country which Russia has managed to gain over the last 31 months of war.  He added that the most likely outcome of the war was that a part of Ukrainian territory would remain under Russian occupation for a number of years.  A defeat of either Ukraine or Russia ""will simply not happen"", Pavel told the Times, adding that the end of the conflict would be ""somewhere in between"". Zelensky's US trip comes as Ukraine continues to come under sustained attack by Russia.  An incursion by Ukrainian troops into Russia's Kursk region in August failed to ease the pressure put by Moscow on eastern Ukraine.  Several regions continue to see daily casualties and widespread damage to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. There are concerns Russia could seize more key towns in the east of the country. In a daytime attack on Tuesday, Russia hit a high-rise apartment block in Ukraine's northeastern city of Kharkiv.  At least three people died and 15 were injured in the attack, which local authorities said was carried out with glide bombs.  On Monday night, an attack on the eastern Ukrainian town of Poltava damaged infrastructure, while in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia one person died and six others were wounded following ""massive air strikes"". Russian troops have made serious advances in the east and are closing in on Vuhledar - a city on the southern part of the Donbas front line that the Russians have been trying to seize since the beginning of their full-scale invasion.  Ukrainian military expert and retired colonel Kostyantyn Mashovets warned his fellow Ukrainians they had to be ""psychologically prepared"" for the loss of Selydove, Toretsk and Vuhledar in the eastern region of Donbas. ""I would love to be wrong,"" he wrote on Facebook.  ""But from the information I have... this is a very likely scenario of events in the near future."""

Details have been kept secret,  but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.  It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election. They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled. Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event. In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was ""designed to help Democrats"" and claimed it amounted to ""election interference"".  He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.  The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign. Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the ""greatest salesman on Earth"" and accused him of refusing to ""make a deal"" with Moscow. Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: ""They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight.""  The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion. At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.  Before the meeting, Biden said: ""Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail"". He also pledged to support Kyiv ""in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato"". Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its ""unwavering bipartisan support"". He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.  With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election. On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.  Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a ""specific signal"" to the West.  Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine. The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly. Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months. Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor. At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8el72ldpr4o,"Russia gripped by human rights crackdown, says UN",A UN investigation found evidence of increased police brutality and repression since February 2022.,23 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:21.539106,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Human rights in Russia have “severely deteriorated” since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, culminating in a “systematic crackdown” on civil society, a UN report has found. The investigation details police brutality, widespread repression of independent media and persistent attempts to silence Kremlin critics using punitive new laws. Mariana Katzarova, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Russia, was denied entry into the country and compiled the report by speaking to political groups, activists and lawyers. She found “credible reports” of torture and allegations of sexual violence, rape and threats of sexual abuse by police. The Kremlin has not commented publicly since its release. Human rights abuses in Russia have been well documented during the Vladimir Putin era, but the latest UN report pays particular attention to how the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine has accelerated what it says was previously a “steady decline”. It details how laws passed in recent years targeting the spread of so-called fake news, and individuals or organisations deemed to have received foreign support, have sought to “muzzle” any opposition, both physically and online. The new laws have led to “mass arbitrary arrests” and long prison sentences, it adds. Among the cases the report highlights is that of Artyom Kamardin, who was jailed for seven years for reading an anti-war poem in public - an act authorities deemed to be “inciting hatred”. Ms Katzarova told the BBC: “Russians are getting shockingly long prison sentences.  ""It’s seven years for reading an anti war-poem, or saying a prayer by a priest which was against the war, or producing a play perceived to be anti-war. Two women are still in prison for that in Russia.” She praised those who continue to organise despite threats and said she believes opposition to the war is quietly widespread. “As in any totalitarian, authoritarian state, people don't want to get in trouble - it doesn't mean that they are supportive of some madness, an aggressive war against their neighbour,” she added. The report accuses the government of seeking to propagate its views on the Ukraine conflict among children via the introduction of mandatory school lessons, officially labelled as “important conversations”. “Children refusing to attend such classes and their parents are subject to pressure and harassment,” it adds. The report highlights the case of a fifth-grader from Moscow who was interrogated by police after skipping the class, before their mother was charged with “failing to fulfil parental duties”. It found that many men sent to Ukraine “have been mobilised by deception, the use of force, or by taking advantage of their vulnerability”, while those who have refused to fight have been held in detention centres in occupied areas and “threatened with execution, violence or a prison sentence if they did not return to the front lines”. Men from indigenous communities make up a disproportionate number of those drafted into the army, it found, and there is evidence “authorities have imposed travel restrictions, blocking exit routes from towns and villages during mobilisation sweeps”. Ms Katzarova said: “Indigenous people… are really facing extinction if this continues.  ""I think, partly my guess and the trends that indigenous leaders are painting, is that this is part of the Russian authorities really wanting to send to the front line ‘disposable people’, not the Slavs from St Petersburg or Moscow.” Elsewhere in the report: The report deals with human rights in Russia’s internationally recognised borders, so does not comment on reported abuses in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5eyqjz1yjo,Russian opposition activist killed fighting for Ukraine,Ildar Dadin was killed when his battalion came under Russian artillery fire in north-eastern Ukraine.,8 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:21.668262,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ildar Dadin, a well-known Russian opposition activist who was fighting in Ukraine on the side of Kyiv, has been killed in action, according to the group that recruited him. A spokeswoman for that group, the Civic Council, told the BBC that Dadin had died, adding that ""he was, and he remains a hero"". The activist-turned-fighter was killed when soldiers from his volunteer battalion, the Freedom of Russia Legion, came under Russian artillery fire in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine. For now, there are no more details and the Legion itself won’t comment whilst it says a military operation is still active. But Ilia Ponamarev, an exiled Russian opposition politician with previous links to the Legion, has told the BBC he is ""certain, alas"" that Dadin is dead. Another source clarified that this was ""confirmed by those who were with him in battle"". The latest messages I’ve sent to his phone are still marked ""unread"". Ildar Dadin became known in Russia a decade ago for his persistence in staging peaceful protests as political repression there intensified. He was the first person prosecuted under a new Article 212.1 - quickly dubbed Dadin’s Law - that in 2014 made it a criminal offence to commit repeat violations of Russia’s increasingly restrictive rules on protest. In his case, that simply meant standing on the streets of Moscow with a banner. Sentenced to two and a half years, Dadin was placed in a punishment cell and immediately went on hunger strike. His prison guards then tortured him to get him to stop. Soon after his release in 2017, I met him in Moscow and he described being hung from a wall by his cuffed wrists. The guards had then threatened him with rape. He admitted that the brutality nearly broke him. So when I learned that Dadin had joined a battalion of Russian volunteers fighting for Ukraine, I got back in touch earlier this year and we had a series of long exchanges. ""I can’t sit by and do nothing and so become an accomplice to Russian evil, to its crimes,"" Dadin explained his decision to sign-up, just as principled and intense as I remembered him. He’d always considered himself a pacifist but now listed his reasons for taking-up arms: ""The aggression, the mass killing, the torture, rape and looting."" Still, he chose the callsign Gandhi. Dadin felt deeply that that he bore personal responsibility for Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. He argued that he and fellow Russians had failed to stop Vladimir Putin, allowing themselves to be scared off the streets by police violence and the threat of prison. ""The main thing now is to act according to my conscience,"" Dadin wrote to me one night from near the frontline in Sumy. He initially signed-up with the Siberian Battalion in June 2023 before moving to the Freedom of Russia Legion last winter - both officially part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Recruits are mainly Russian citizens who hope that helping Ukraine defeat Vladimir Putin will be a first step towards ending his rule in the Kremlin. Their numbers aren’t clear, nor their effectiveness as a fighting force. They have claimed some successes, including a cross-border incursion into Russia earlier this year at the time of Putin’s re-election. But for Dadin, the experience wasn’t quite as he’d hoped. He felt that some of the missions his unit were sent on were ""pointless"" in any military sense. He described one battle where he ended up pinned down for eight hours by Russian fire in a bomb crater, with a drone trying to drop a grenade on him, whilst a fellow volunteer soldier bled to death. And like many Ukrainian soldiers, he was exhausted, fighting with barely any days off and limping from a wound to his hip. I wondered whether he might leave, but Dadin was clear his conscience would not allow him to sit ""on the sidelines"". Not whilst Ukrainians were being killed, as he put it, ""by Russian criminals"". ""I tried to stop Russia - but did I do it? No,"" he berated himself in one of our last chats. ""And thousands of people have been killed because I did not do enough."" Those who sent him to fight, disagree. ""Ildar was strong, brave, principled and honest,"" the Civic Council wrote. ""That’s how we should remember him."""

Prof Mark Hannaford, from east Devon, was awarded a medal in September by the head of military commission in Lviv, western Ukraine, for his efforts to support and train local medical professionals in the country. He co-founded Medics4Ukraine together with paramedic Luca Alfatti - also awarded a medal - soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The organisation has so far delivered more than £3m of medical aid to Ukraine and conducts trauma medical courses for front-line soldiers and medics. Prof Hannaford said he was ""deeply honoured"" to receive the award, which was presented earlier this month. ""The true heroes are the Ukrainian medical professionals who work tirelessly in extremely challenging conditions.  ""Our mission is to support them with the skills and knowledge they need to save lives."" The programme said it had trained more than 800 medical professionals and helped them respond to medical emergencies. ""We're training medical professionals who don't normally see trauma, but, due to what's going on, they're seeing it on an everyday basis.  ""And we're training them in an underground bunker."" Prof Hannaford said he was ""gobsmacked"" by the support Medics4Ukraine had received. ""The initiative started in Beer village,"" he said. ""They gave me the confidence to get going, and we set an initial target of raising £100,000. ""We are getting up to £3.5m now due to the generosity of people, largely in the South West, so we can't thank them enough."" Follow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx245n0gex5o,Three killed in Russian strike on Kharkiv apartment,The daytime attack using guided bombs wounds another 31 people in the north-eastern Ukrainian city.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:21.913719,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia has struck an apartment block in the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, killing at least three people and injuring 31 more, say local officials. The wave of strikes, which officials said had hit four districts, was conducted with the use of guided glide bombs on Tuesday. ""The targets for Russian bombs are a residential building, a bakery, a stadium... that is, the ordinary life of ordinary people,"" said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. The attack comes as fighting intensifies in the country's east with Russian troops encircling and closing in on the largely destroyed town of Vuhledar. Shortly after Tuesday's blitz in Kharkiv, Zelensky issued a statement sharing pictures of the destroyed residential tower - which showed a gaping hole in the middle of the building.  He called on allies to ""stop the terror"". He is in New York to address the UN General Assembly's annual congress, having arrived on Monday reiterating Ukraine's need for timely US military assistance. ""There is much discussion now at the UN General Assembly about collective efforts for security and the future. But we just need to stop the terror. To have security. To have a future,"" Zelensky said. Meanwhile in Kharkiv, officials said the block that was hit had previously been struck at the start of the war. ""It was almost repaired, all the windows were put in, insulated, and prepared for the heating season. The enemy hit it a second time with a KAB [glide bomb],"" said  Kharkiv's mayor Ihor Terekov on Telegram. Russia has increasingly been using glide bombs in recent months - Soviet-era bombs fitted out with wings and satellite navigation aids. They are cheap, destructive, and are said to have been key to Russia's effort to capture further ground in Ukraine. They were used in May in attacks in Kharkiv, while military analysts also note that they appear to have been used for the first time in Zaporizhzhia city on Sunday night. Ukrainian officials said Russia conducted seven airstrikes with KAB glide bombs, injuring at least 21 civilians in the attacks on 13 residential buildings and two educational facilities. Zaporizhzhia officials also said Russia had conducted another strike on the south-eastern city on Monday night, which killed one person and injured at least four others including two children. Russian forces have made serious advances in Ukraine's east and are closing in on Vuhledar - a coal-mining town on the southern part of the Donbas front line. The Russians have been trying to seize the town since the beginning of their full-scale invasion. On Monday, Russian military bloggers were reporting that Moscow's troops had entered the outskirts of the town in the Donetsk region. Ukraine's military has mentioned only a number of attempts to capture its positions in Vuhledar.  Meanwhile, Russian forces have also recently advanced near Hlyboke, Kupyansk, and Pokrovsk, according to the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. The war tracking group said Ukrainian forces had recently advanced in Kursk region."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl8187l920o,Thousands of cars that crash in US are ending up in Russia,"The South Caucasus nation of Georgia has a huge used car market, with many vehicles finding their way over the border.",14 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:26:22.042807,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The small South Caucasus nation of Georgia has become a multi-billion dollar hub for the international used car market. The vehicles are mostly sourced from the US, and many appear to be ending up in Russia. On the dusty outskirts of Rustavi, an industrial town 20km (12 miles) southeast of Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, is a vast area of open-air carparks. Equivalent in size to more than 40 football pitches, it hosts thousands of vehicles up for sale. You can find pretty much any automobile your heart desires - Mercedes, Porsches, Jaguars, Toyotas and, more recently, Teslas. They are all here.  One of the largest carparks is owned by Caucasus Auto Import (CAI), a company that buys used cars from auctions in the US. The vehicles have often been so badly damaged in accidents that they have been written-off by American insurance firms. CAI says that its “team of experts” in the States will pick up the cars in person, and then arrange their export by container ship, 10,000km (6,000 miles) to a port on Georgia’s Black Sea coastline. The damaged cars will then be fixed by Georgian mechanics. “Our company has contributed a lot to the renewal of the Georgian fleet of cars,” says David Gulashvili, CAI’s deputy chief executive.  “When we started our business in 2004, Georgian automotive infrastructure was totally Soviet Union produced, like [Soviet brands] Lada and Vaz.” He says that his company has responded to “a lot of demand for Western-produced vehicles”. Today the firm has 600 employees. Last year, Georgia imported $3.1bn (£2.4bn) worth of cars, according to official figures. It then exported vehicles to a value of $2.1bn, mainly to former Soviet republics in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Cars are in fact Georgia’s second-largest export by value, after copper ore. Across the huge car market in Rustavi, curious customers are on the lookout for a deal. Each car has a card on the inside of its windscreen indicating price, engine size, and date of manufacture. Alisher Tezikbayev has travelled here from Kazakhstan. He and a group of his friends are exploring the Toyota section. “We've been re-exporting cars from Georgia for about 3.5 years. We send cars to Kazakhstan and organise auto tours, when clients come to Georgia to pick their own car,” says Mr Tezikbayev, who is posting videos to his 100k followers on Tik Tok. Georgia used to export second-hand US and European cars to its northern neighbour Russia, with whom it shares a border. But that has officially stopped as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In September 2023, the Georgian Revenue Service announced that, in line with the then latest Western sanctions against Russia, it was restricting the re-export and transit of automobiles imported from the US or Europe to Russia and Belarus. And Georgian officials have long denied that the country has been complicit in aiding Russia’s evasion of the trade embargoes. Yet a recent investigation by Georgian media publication Ifacti showed numerous loopholes exploited by an army of car dealers on both sides of the Russian-Georgian border. David Gulashvili says that his company no longer has any trade with Russia. “From day one of the war we have restricted any kind of transactions from Russia, any kind of exports to Russia. You will not see a single car exported by Caucasus Auto Import to Russia.” However, he adds that there is no existing mechanism to monitor the final destination for re-exported cars going to other countries. And since Russia's invasion of Ukraine there has been a steep rise in exports of used cars to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia – all of which are members of the Russia-led customs union. It means that a vehicle registered in any of those countries can be driven to Russia with minimal tariffs. Figures from Georgia’s national statistics agency suggest that cars are indeed going on to Russia. It says that in 2022 Georgia exported 7,352 used cars to Kazakhstan, while in 2023 the number was 39,896, a more than five-fold increase. While the geopolitical machinations rumble on, the underling success of Georgia’s second-hand car industry can be explained by its geography. It has access to Europe via its Black Sea ports, and to Central Asia via Baku, on neighbouring Azerbaijan’s Caspian coast. Another key component is the affordable cost of labour when it comes to fixing salvaged cars. “These cars that have been damaged in the US, most of the time it does not make economical sense to rebuild them in the US,” says Mr Gulashvili. “This is because of the cost of human resources, service costs are much higher, and the legal costs to get those cars back on the road, is time consuming and very expensive process. “In the US rebuilding of a car, and making it legal again, takes six months and let's say $5,000. It takes $1,000 and one month in Georgia to fix the same car.” In a sprawling warehouse on the outskirts of Tbilisi, Zaza Andreashvili leans over a car engine fixed to a specialised stand. The mechanic points to the cylinders, which he has just cleaned. “The engine is the heart of the vehicle. Just like humans, if your heart stop working, you die. The same with the cars, if engine stops working, car dies.” Mr Andreashvili has been repairing car engines for nearly 30 years. “We used to learn through books, there was no internet at the time,” he says. Next door to Mr Andreashvili’s workshop, there is a banging noise. Roma and his apprentice Boris specialise in body work repairs. With a panel-beater, Boris is reshaping the near side wing of a mangled automobile. Roma, in his brown t-shirt with USA written in the front, says he's been repairing cars for 50 years. “Mercedes has the best metal, Volvo and Toyotas are also good, but with some cars the body work is so thin it's like a piece of paper,” he says. While most cars imported into Georgia are petrol and diesel-powered, Mr Gulashvili says there is a fast-growing demand for electric, and particularly hybrid vehicles. “About 30% of the cars we are bringing right now, is hybrid. It is not fully electric, but it's hybrid like Toyota Prius. The growth rate is off the charts, it's like 300 – 400% rate quarter over quarter.” The biggest re-sale market for Teslas, adds Mr Gulashvili, is Ukraine, where he has 100 members of staff based. “It's very expensive and it's very risky, but still we're trying to get traction there. We are also importing a lot of pickup trucks into Ukraine, which are used to fight against Russia.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7xnlxj8qjo,Ukrainian soldiers killed in SUV donated by miners,"A vehicle donated by a group of Welsh miners is destroyed in Ukraine, killing six.",22 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:22.186086,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Six Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in an attack on a vehicle donated by Welsh miners just months ago. The men died when their SUV was shelled by Russian artillery in August, according to a Ukrainian trade union. The car was driven to Ukraine by Welsh miners as part of an aid convoy in February  and some of the men who died were Ukrainian miners. Attacks on donated vehicles have only now been revealed, including one which was destroyed in 2022. It is not known if anyone was injured in that attack.  Carwyn Donovan, 36 from Abercraf, Powys, drove the vehicle that was destroyed to Ukraine last month.  Looking at a picture of the wreckage, he points out the now barely visible sticker he placed on the front. “You can just see the Ukrainian flag that we put on it before we left - it's still there,” he said. Mr Donovan has taken part in seven aid convoys to Ukraine. He said knowing people were killed when the vehicle was attacked was “gut wrenching”. “There's an overwhelming sense of sadness for the lives lost but also a profound admiration for their bravery and their selflessness,” he said. “There’s a feeling of helplessness and even guilt knowing that these people have paid the ultimate price for something which is in all of our interests.” The attack in August happened in the Kharkiv area, not far from the Russian border.  ""This aid is especially critical,"" said Olesia Briazgunova, from the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. She said the vehicles in particular were “a vital aspect of Ukraine's defence”. The vehicles are used by “defenders, volunteers, medics and rescue services - and often save lives, especially in regions close to hostilities”, she added. Welsh miners delivered medicine, warm clothing and vehicles to Ukrainian miners in Kyiv in February. The link between Wales and Ukraine began in the 1980s when Ukrainian miners, then part of the Soviet Union, donated a portion of their wages to striking miners. The donated vehicles have been used to take supplies to the front line and evacuate civilians from dangerous areas. There are currently hundreds, if not thousands of miners fighting in the war against Russia. Ukrainian soldiers sent a video message to miners in Wales thanking them for the vehicles and aid. They said: “Thanks to our British colleagues from the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers). “Thank you to all the people of the UK for your continued support and help - the war continues,” they said. Standing holding a Welsh flag in front of a donated vehicle they said: “We fight every day for our independence and peace in Ukraine and all of Europe. “These vehicles help us to save lives - and bring our victory closer."" The NUM, a cross-party Senedd group and Welsh businesses have donated 25 vehicles since the conflict began in 2022, with funds being raised for five more.  There are now plans for another aid convoy from Wales to Ukraine in October. Former Welsh government counsel general Mick Antoniw travelled as part of the convoy in February. The Pontypridd Member of the Senedd (MS) has Ukrainian heritage and relatives of his have been killed in the war.  He said the vehicles they were supplying “are vulnerable to artillery and drone attacks”. “These vehicles which we deliver save Ukrainian lives on the front line”, he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rdygy5888o,Far right in Austria 'opens new era' with election victory,"The Freedom Party wins its first election, but building a coalition will be difficult.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:22.320312,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) has opened the door to a new era, its leader Herbert Kickl has told supporters, as they celebrated an unprecedented election victory. Kickl's party won 28.9% of the vote according to official tallies - almost three points ahead of the conservative People's Party (ÖVP) on 26.3%, but far short of a majority. Kickl's victory is only the latest in a string of far-right election successes in Europe and he praised voters for their ""optimism, courage and trust"" in delivering a ""piece of history"". The FPÖ has been in coalition before, but the second-placed ÖVP has refused to take part in a government led by Kickl. Kickl's main rival, incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer of the ÖVP, has said it was “impossible to form a government with someone who adores conspiracy theories”. There was a high turnout of 77.3% as Austrian voters took part in an election dominated by the twin issues of migration and asylum, as well as a flagging economy and the war in Ukraine.  As half the map of Austria turned dark blue, FPÖ general secretary Michael Schnedlitz said ""the men and women of Austria have made history today"", although he refused to say what kind of coalition his party would try to build.  Postal votes were still being counted on Monday morning, but an analysis of voters suggested those aged 35-59 were most likely to back the far right, and marginally more women than men. Kickl's party has won 57 seats in the 183-seat parliament, with the conservatives on 51 and the Social Democrats on 41, according to government projections. Most of the votes have now been counted, but the final result will not be officially declared until Thursday. The Freedom Party's fiery leader had promised Austrians to build ""Fortress Austria"", to restore their security, prosperity and peace.  The party wants firm rules on legal immigration and it has promoted the idea of remigration, which involves sending asylum seekers to their original countries. It also wants a bar on the right to asylum as a step towards citizenship. Herbert Kickl has aligned himself closely with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his self-styled ""illiberal democracy"". On Sunday night, Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler warned that Austria must not follow the same path as Hungary. Kickl had also spoken of becoming Volkskanzler (people's chancellor) which for some Austrians carries echoes of the term used to describe Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.  The FPÖ was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s. Two days before the vote some of its candidates were caught on video at a funeral where an SS song was sung. The party later denied the song, dating back to 1814, had any link to ""National Socialist sentiments"". As the party's victory became clear, a small group of protesters appeared outside parliament carrying anti-Nazi banners. One read ""Nazis, get out of parliament"", while another said, ""Don't let Nazis govern, and never [let them] march"". Forming a coalition is likely to prove complicated for Kickl, who is a divisive figure. The Social Democrats, Greens and Neos have all ruled out a partnership with the far right.  The only possible coalition Kickl's party could form is with the conservatives, although the FPÖ would have to find a solution to the ÖVP's refusal to have Kickl as chancellor.  When Geert Wilders' Freedom Party won the Netherlands' election last November, he dropped his bid to become prime minister so that three other parties would agree to form a coalition. However, Kickl is keen to lead his country, promising Austrians to act as their ""servant and protector"". Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC it was by no means clear that Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, who oversees the formation of government, would give Kickl a “direct mandate to form a coalition”. The ÖVP could in theory scrape together a coalition with the Social Democrats if the latest projections are correct, and could attract the liberal Neos party or the Greens.  Equally, Karl Nehammer may come under pressure from within the ÖVP to drop his objection. One leading FPÖ figure said after such a historic defeat he should resign, although that was rejected by the general secretary of Nehammer's party. President Van der Bellen has voiced reservations in the past about the FPÖ because of its criticism of the EU and its failure to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The party opposes EU sanctions on Moscow, citing Austria's neutrality, and many of its MPs walked out of a speech to the parliament in Vienna last year by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. On Monday, Austrians had mixed feelings about the election results. ""I find it really sad that people get so close to radical right-wing ideas and ignore history,"" Nikolai Selikovsky, a resident of Vienna - which predominantly voted for the Social Democrats - told AFP.  ""It also shows the failure of the other parties that they can't talk to each other constructively."" ""I’m asking myself what we did wrong in the past 75 years,"" Karin Grobert, a commuter, told Reuters. She expressed concern that Austria will shift further to the right if coalition talks fail. But Josef Binder, a 57-year-old carpenter who voted for FPÖ, said there was no reason other parties could not cooperate with Kickl.  ""They also have to realise, the other parties, that if they negate 29% of voters, that that's actually not okay, it's undemocratic,"" he added. Some worried about what the FPÖ's policy of remigration could mean for them. Berat Oeztoprak, a 22-year-old kebab seller in Vienna, told Reuters: ""What I might fear is that many will no longer be allowed to stay here."" He added: ""I was born in Austria and I know that I belong here. I also did two years in the army and I have a badge. And I also served for the state for two years, I pay my taxes, I'm nice to the people here, they're just as nice to me."" Kickl's victory is the latest in almost a year of vote successes for radical right-wing parties in Europe.  Italy's Giorgia Meloni heads a right-wing coalition as leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party and Germany's AfD topped the polls in the eastern state of Thuringia last month. France's National Rally won the vote in European elections last June. Unlike Kickl, Italy's prime minister has given her full backing to the EU's defence of Ukraine in the face of Russia's full-scale invasion. AfD co-leader Alice Weidel congratulated Kickl, posting a picture of the two together, and Marine le Pen of the National Rally said ""this groundswell carrying the defence of national interests"", after the votes elsewhere in Europe, confirmed the ""people's triumphs everywhere"". Geert Wilders said times were changing, and that ""identity, sovereignty, freedom and no more illegal immigration/asylum"" was what millions of Europeans were longing for. Kickl has tapped into fears about immigration in Austria and he has made the most of anger at the government's handling of the Covid pandemic, embracing conspiracy theories about obscure treatments for the virus. For Kickl and his party, Sunday's election victory represents a significant recovery from 2019, when they came a distant third in the wake of a video sting scandal that engulfed their former leader."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lg92edj7o,Palestinian refugee to challenge family reunion bid rejection,"Hadil Lous, who lives in Broughty Ferry, has been trying to reunite with her parents and four siblings.",6 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:27.784610,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Palestinian refugee is taking the Home Office to court to challenge its refusal to let her parents and siblings join her in Scotland. Hadil Louz, 32, lives in Broughty Ferry with her husband Ibrahim and eight-month-old daughter Laila. She has been trying to reunite with her parents and four siblings and earlier this year applied to the Home Office for permission to allow them to join her in the UK. But the Home Office rejected the application and said the family had not demonstrated “circumstances which are so compelling as to make them exceptional”. Ms Louz is now appealing against that decision in the Scottish courts. Campaigners are also calling for the introduction of a family reunification scheme for Palestinians, similar to those which were previously introduced for people fleeing Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine. Ms Louz, who has been in the UK since 2018, is studying at St Andrews University as part of a PHD scholarship programme. She currently has protection status as a refugee in the UK but plans to apply for indefinite leave to remain next year, which would make her status permanent if successful. She told BBC Scotland News that she came from “a normal family, living their lives, working and having a simple life in Gaza. “My brothers and sisters were studying at university or high school. They had a peaceful life even if it was interrupted by war.” The attack on Israel by Hamas on 7 October has been followed by a year of conflict. Earlier this year Ms Louz raised £40,000 on the GoFundMe platform to pay for four members of her family to be evacuated from Gaza through the Rafah crossing to Egypt. Her parents are currently in the UAE, where her father is receiving humanitarian treatment for lymphoma cancer, provided by the state. He can remain there while receiving treatment, but may need to return to Egypt when this ends. Five of her siblings are currently living as undocumented immigrants in Egypt and her other two sisters are in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza because she did not have enough funds to secure their passage to Egypt. The Home Office application only applies to her four unmarried siblings in Egypt. Ms Louz said: “The only thing I was able to do was to try and find a way to bring them to safety, so that was my priority. They are all dependent on me, I am the only one that can help them. “Safety is to be surrounded by your family, it’s not to be safe from missiles and bombardments, that’s not the only meaning of safety. “Being deprived of the right of being surrounded by my family, safe and healthy, is really difficult.” Earlier this year she applied to the Home Office for what is known as family reunification protection, in an effort to enable her parents and siblings to join her in the UK. This scheme applies to a partner or dependent child and - in most cases - siblings, the parents of adult children and extended family are not eligible. However, they may also be granted refugee status if they have ""exceptional circumstances"", according to the Home Office. Lawyer Andy Sirel, from human rights law firm JustRightScotland, said he thought the way the Home Office conducted themselves with the family was “unfair and at times unlawful”. He said: “They advised her (Ms Louz) that her family’s circumstances are not exceptional enough and that the suffering they have experienced in Gaza is not above the level of other Palestinians in Gaza. Not only is that not a lawful test, it’s inhumane.” The Scottish Refugee Council is calling for the introduction of a family reunification scheme for Palestinians, similar to that introduced after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 and the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022. The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme allows those who were evacuated to the UK to bring over parents and siblings in “exceptional circumstances”. The Ukrainian Family Scheme, which closed to new applicants earlier this year, also allowed eligible Ukrainian nationals to join family members in the UK for up to three years. Sabir Zazai, the chair of the Scottish Refugee Council, said the UK government had the opportunity to introduce a family scheme and expand the definition of family. “In many cultures family is much wider than just spouses and children,” he said. “I’m from Afghanistan. In my culture looking after my family, my father, my mother and sisters and brothers, is part of my values. “We believe that when people are forced to flee their homes, when their lives are shattered, it takes all parts of society to work together to help them rebuild their lives in safety and dignity.

On Friday, Guernsey Police said there was no evidence of unexploded World War Two bombs believed to have been dropped on a field beside Route Isabelle. Former soldier Ben Remfrey, who had raised the issue, said police and the States of Guernsey had ""tried to silence"" his concerns and ""factual evidence"" about the private land near the Wellington Close housing development. A police and States spokesperson said they would be reviewing the situation regularly, and they ""continue to welcome Mr Remfrey’s comments on our statement"". Mr Remfrey, who has been training the Ukrainian military to deal with explosives during its conflict with Russia, claimed he had ""compelling details"" of three bombs at the site. He said a survey of the land done by the States in 2019 used shallow handheld electromagnetic equipment, which he claimed would not find ""buried bombs"". Mr Remfrey added he had evidence dating back to 1941 about the bombs he claimed the police and States would not allow him to post on their own social media posts. On Facebook, he accused the authorities of being ""willing to gamble with peoples lives"". ""Guernsey Police and States of Guernsey Home Affairs Committee tried to silence my valid concerns and factual evidence, and compelling details, of the three bombs in Route Isabelle,"" Mr Remfrey said. A Guernsey Police and the States of Guernsey spokesperson said the authorities would keep reviewing the matter and would welcome Mr Remfrey to a meeting to discuss his concerns. They said they were aware of historical records about bombs being dropped in the area. ""We have been and continue to welcome Mr Remfrey’s comments on our statement,"" the spokesperson said. ""While he hasn’t been able to comment with images, that is because of a Facebook setting, not because of any action taken by Guernsey Police. ""We have however left links to his personal page in our comments so members of the public can see the images he is referring to."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4dwgr2y41o,Saoirse Ronan says WW2 film is 'incredibly relevant',The world premiere of Sir Steve McQueen's Blitz will open the London Film Festival on Wednesday.,5 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:28.101764,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Actress Saoirse Ronan has said shooting her new World War Two film felt ""incredibly relevant"" against the backdrop of conflict around the world. Blitz, directed by Sir Steve McQueen, was mostly filmed in early 2023, about a year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to journalists ahead of its world premiere in London, Ronan said: ""You’d shoot certain scenes where there's total chaos and pandemonium, and we're portraying characters in abject fear and horror. ""And then you'd leave set, turn on the radio, and you'd hear exactly the same thing, or put on the news and see exactly the same thing."" She continued: ""It was the first time I'd ever had the experience on a project where there wasn't really an escape from it.  ""I don't know if it's insensitive to say that I was grateful for it, but it gave you so much motivation to continue with the picture, because it does feel incredibly relevant."" The film launched this year's London Film Festival on Wednesday evening, and saw Ronan join her co-stars including Stephen Graham, Paul Weller and Benjamin Clementine on the red carpet at the Royal Festival Hall. Blitz is one of the few contenders for next year's film awards season not to have already been screened at an earlier festival - leaving pundits unable to rate its Oscars chances until now. But Sir Steve wanted the film to receive its world premiere in London because it tells a uniquely British story.  ""I'm a Londoner and I've been very fortunate to debut films at Cannes, Venice, Telluride, Toronto [film festivals],"" the director said. ""But for this particular movie, for me there was no other place I wanted to debut this film other than London, and I was crossing my fingers that that could happen."" Blitz follows a working class London family as the British capital is bombed during World War Two. The story is told through the eyes of George, a nine-year-old mixed-race boy played by newcomer Elliott Heffernan, who is one of about a million children sent away from the big cities during the Blitz to live in the countryside for their safety.  George, however, adamantly does not want to leave his mother and grandfather in London, and jumps from the train during its journey away from the city to pursue his own adventure. His mother, played by Ronan, is sick with worry as she waits for updates from the authorities who are trying to find him. Several critics have given Blitz rave reviews. Awarding the film five stars, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey described it as ""a monumental achievement in British cinema"". The Telegraph's Robbie Collin also awarded it five stars, saying the film ""ranks among the greatest war films ever made"". Blitz is ""not McQueen’s finest film"", said the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis, ""but it’s streets ahead of wartime schmaltz like Darkest Hour"".  In another five-star review, Metro's Tori Brazier said: ""We’ve all seen many good war films, but Blitz more than holds its own in the genre by taking a look at a specific time and through a specific lens."" However, the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw offered just three stars and said he was hoping for ""a more radical shock... or a more distinctive authorial challenge"". Variety's Owen Gleiberman said the film was ""well-staged, well-acted, and given a creamy deluxe wartime period-piece sheen"". ""But,"" he continued, ""this is mostly the war diary as inspirational crowd-pleaser. It’s also an ardently traditional message movie about race and tolerance."" The Hollywood Reporter's Leslie Felperin suggested the story and characters could have been given ""more room to breathe"", adding: ""The drama too often lacks the subtlety that distinguishes [Sir Steve's] work at its best."" Sir Steve is best known for directing Widows, Shame and 12 Years A Slave, which won the Oscar for best picture in 2014. Speaking on Wednesday about his stimulus for the new film, the director said he had come across a photo that intrigued him while working on his 2020 TV series Small Axe. ""I found a photograph of a small black child at a railway station, with an oversized briefcase. And I thought, who is that child? I want to see the war from his eyes."" Actor Graham noted the film takes a slightly different perspective from many other films set in World War Two, partly because the lead character is a mixed-race child. ""As a kid, I was used to watching these wonderful black-and-white films with my nana - 'Cor blimey, guv’na, let’s push through the war',"" Graham joked, adopting an exaggerated Cockney accent. ""We were brought up watching those films, and they were beautiful films, but I've never seen this vision that Steve brought to the screen, this perspective... a mixed-race child in a war film set in the Blitz."" But when asked if he viewed the film as an opportunity to correct the way the Blitz is traditionally viewed, Sir Steve replied: ""I'm not interested in correcting anything. I'm not a reactionary. I'm an artist.  ""I love to work on things which mean something to me,"" he continued. ""What was so interesting to me about the idea of this landscape was that it was about a working class family. This was a family drama as well as a historical epic."" Ronan's character Rita is one of millions of women who stepped into jobs previously filled by men who had gone off to fight. ""For them to have been the core power within their home, taking Rita for example as someone who has a child to take care of, a father to provide for, and to step into the role of men when they left, I'm sure was incredibly trying for these young women, who were in their 20s and so much was being expected of them."" Blitz will be released in cinemas on 1 November before streaming on Apple TV+ later that month. It is one of two films Ronan stars in that could be in contention in the coming awards season. She will campaign for best supporting actress for Blitz, and best leading actress for The Outrun, in which she plays an alcoholic returning to her family in Orkney."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0g6zr7gz1o,Mason happy to repeat 'no genocide' claim after SNP expulsion,The veteran SNP politician has been expelled from the party after claiming there is no genocide in Gaza.,2 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:26:28.276448,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"An MSP who was expelled from the SNP over social media posts about the Israel-Gaza war says he stands by his comments. John Mason said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" to be expelled, but was ""happy"" to repeat the comments that led to his initial suspension.  The Glasgow Shettleston MSP had the whip removed in August following a post on X that there was ""no genocide"" in Gaza. He said he was considering appealling his expulsion, which was confirmed on Saturday. The SNP have said they cannot comment on ongoing disciplinary process. At the time of his initial suspension, a spokesperson for the SNP chief whip described Mason's comments as ""utterly abhorrent"".  Mason - who had been an SNP MSP for 16 years - told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""To be expelled over a disagreement over the definition of a word – an important word, genocide – but to be expelled for that reason is extremely disappointing.”   He said he was ""happy"" to repeat his claims.  “There is a war going on,"" the MSP, who will now sit at Holyrood as an independent, said.  ""Lives have been lost, desperately sadly, as they have been in Ukraine, as they have been in every war. “But there is a difference between war and genocide and to say that every war is genocide is not the way we use that word.” He said he “totally regretted” the loss of life but that Israel feels “very threatened”. Mason told the BBC: “We don’t tend to say that the bombing of German cities was genocide, we don’t tend to say that Hiroshima was genocide – these were acts of war, maybe disproportionate. “Genocide is a very serious word,” he added. “To just mix up the words genocide and war is not accurate.” The SNP Member Conduct Committee, which ruled that Mason should be expelled, accused Mason of claiming to be the “arbiter” of what is considered to be genocide, describing that as “unacceptable and offensive”. In a letter to the MSP, the committee also said he had misrepresented SNP policy and had shown “no contrition”. Mason denied was was claiming to be the “arbiter” of what was genocide and called for the party to be “tolerant” on such issues. He said the SNP should be a “big tent”, adding: “On issues like this that are not central to independence, we should allow a bit of latitude so that no one person is the arbiter of a word like genocide.” The Shettleston MSP said he supported the party in calling for a two-state solution the conflict, but said he did not understand the party policy he is accused of disagreeing with. Mason, 67, said he had already decided to retire at the next election, scheduled for 2026.  He has been given 21 days to appeal but said he would be prepared see out the remainder of the term as an independent. The MSP added: “If I am independent then I have a bit more freedom but I will be doing all I can to support the SNP.” About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage during Hamas’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Since then, more than 42,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dpxkknen5o,India rejects report on transfer of ammunitions to Ukraine as 'speculative',A Reuters report claims that Indian-made artillery shells were diverted to Ukraine by some European countries.,20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:28.424827,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"India has dismissed a news report claiming the government failed to prevent European buyers from transferring Indian-made artillery shells to Ukraine. In a story published on Thursday, Reuters alleged that artillery shells sold by Indian arms makers had been diverted by European customers to Ukraine. The report alleged that the transfer of ammunition has been ongoing for more than a year, with Delhi taking no action to stop it despite repeated protests from Moscow. India's foreign ministry has called the report ""speculative” and “misleading"".  The report ""implies violations by India, where none exist, and hence, is inaccurate and mischievous"", Randhir Jaiswal, the ministry's spokesperson wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Mr Jaiswal added that India has an “impeccable track record compliance with international obligations” on non-proliferation of arms and has its own robust export rules. Moscow is yet to react to the report or Delhi's statement.  Indian arms export regulations restrict the use of weapons to the designated buyer, and any unauthorised transfers could jeopardise future sales. In May, India had announced further tightening of export rules, mandating that buyers ensure the arms are not sent to third countries. Ukraine, which is battling a renewed offensive from Russia, reportedly grapples with a shortage of artillery ammunition. Citing unnamed Indian and European government and defence industry officials along with customs data, the Reuters report said that India produced a small amount of the ammunition being used by Ukraine - which is estimated to be under 1% of the total arms imported by Kyiv since the war began in 2021.  Italy and the Czech Republic are among the European countries sending Indian ammunitions to Ukraine, it added.  The report said Moscow had raised the issue with Delhi on at least two occasions, including during a meeting between the foreign ministers of both countries in July. India has refrained from directly criticising Russia over the war, which has drawn the annoyance of Western powers. Delhi, however, has often spoken about the importance of respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. It has continuously pushed for diplomacy and dialogue to end the war. India and Russia have traditionally shared warm relations, and Moscow remains an important trade and defence partner for Delhi despite Western sanctions on Russia. Last year, Russia was India’s biggest oil supplier. In the defence sector, it continues to be India's biggest ally, supplying more than 60% of Delhi's needs. In July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first bilateral trip to Russia after being elected to his third term, where he referred to President Vladimir Putin as a “dear friend”. But Modi’s Russia visit invited the ire of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said he was “disappointed to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow”. Weeks later, Modi visited Ukraine and held talks with Zelensky, which analysts said was in line with India's famed non-alignment approach to geopolitics.  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zymygrgdo,"We must show nerve in support for Ukraine, says Lammy",It comes as Ukraine continues to call for permission to fire Western long-range missiles into Russia.,22 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:28.561834,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The foreign secretary has said allies must show ""nerve"" in their support for Ukraine, as the country continues to call for permission to fire Western long-range missiles into Russia.  David Lammy said there was a ""real-time discussion"" between allies about how to help Ukraine heading into the winter. Speaking alongside him at a fringe event at Labour's party conference, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Valerii Zaluzhnyi said lifting restrictions on the use of weapons against military targets in Russia was ""critical"". Ukraine already has supplies of long-range missiles from the UK, the United States and France but at the moment it is only allowed to fire them at targets within its own borders. Mr Lammy told the event: ""This is a critical time for nerve and for guts and for patience and for fortitude on behalf of allies who stand with Ukraine."" He added: ""I am not going to, as foreign secretary, of course, comment on operational detail, because that can only aid Putin. ""But there is a very real-time discussion across allies about how we can support Ukraine as we head into the winter."" Earlier, Mr Zaluzhnyi had described weapons with long-range capabilities as ""critically important"".  ""Lifting restrictions on use of weapons against military targets in Russia is critical. This would help protect civilians from Russian missiles,"" he said. ""This winter in Ukraine will be the most difficult. As we know, I believe in the resilience of the Ukrainian people, but without additional help the price will be very, very high."" Earlier this month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden met  in Washington to discuss the issue.  There had been strong indications the US and the UK were poised to lift the restrictions on long-range missiles but no confirmation came after the talks. Discussions are expected to continue at the UN General Assembly in New York next week, which Sir Keir and Biden are attending alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under regular bombardment. Many of these missiles are launched by aircraft deep inside Russia and Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself. Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded for the restrictions on the use of long-range missiles to be lifted.  However, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned against this, arguing it would represent ""direct participation"" by Western allies in the war.  Ukraine’s allies have been reluctant to do anything which could drag them into direct conflict with Moscow. In his speech to the main conference hall later, Lammy insisted the government would always stand with Ukraine and had committed £3bn per year in military aid ""for as long as it takes"".  ""We need to show Putin that Britain - and its allies - are not going anywhere,"" he said. He also spoke about the ""worrying escalation"" in fighting between Israel and Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollah in recent days, which he said was in ""nobody's interest"".  ""Our message to all parties is clear: we need an immediate ceasefire from both sides so that we can get to a political settlement,"" he said. ""So that Israelis and Lebanese civilians can return to their homes and live in peace and security."" He repeated his call for British nationals still in Lebanon to leave immediately ""for your own safety""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeyqy1q5g5o,'Anti-Russian sentiments' worry UK balalaika group,The founder of the UK's only balalaika orchestra thinks potential members may be hesitant to join.,3 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:28.702558,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Britain's only balalaika orchestra is struggling for members partly because of anti-Russian sentiment within the UK, its founder has said. Common in Eastern European folk music, balalaikas usually have three strings and look like small triangular guitars. The Kalinka Balalaika Orchestra was established in Manchester in 1984 by Brian Hulme, a languages teacher who introduced some of his students to the instrument, which is actually part of the lute family. ""It’s become difficult at the moment because of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,"" Mr Hulme said, stressing that his orchestra were ""not spokespersons for Russian policy or anything like that"". Balalaikas have ""got a such a unique sound"", said Mr Hulme. ""As well as playing the melody of pieces, it has a throbbing sound because it’s played with the fingers.  ""You don’t just pluck the strings, you actually strike the strings."" His orchestra meets every Monday at Chorlton Central Church. One of its younger members, Albert, said the balalaika was ""really easy to get the hang of"". The 16-year-old said being part of the orchestra was a ""big part of my week"". Fellow member Isla Graham said: ""It’s a really unique instrument – not a lot of people know what it is, especially in the UK. “I like being able to say that I do something different to most people."" Mr Hulme said he hoped more people would ""come and have a go"" and help ensure balalaika music was enjoyed for generations to come. ""Back in the 1980s the balalaika was seen as something exotic,"" he said. ""When we did concerts we had loads of people [and] could fill the Royal Northern College of Music quite easily."" Over the years his orchestra has performed dozens of concerts, appeared at festivals, and even played for Ewan McGregor's character in this year's television series A Gentleman in Moscow. ""Oddly enough it was mostly filmed in Bolton,"" Mr Hulme revealed. ""The Metropol Hotel in Moscow, which in the 1920s was dripping with opulence and luxury, was filmed in a Methodist hall in Bolton.  ""How they transformed it all is beyond me!""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y97k4w7llo,UK-linked firms suspected of busting Russia sanctions,"The government is investigating 37 companies - but has yet to hand out any fines, the BBC discovers.",4 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:28.990944,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The government is carrying out 37 investigations into UK-linked businesses for potentially breaking Russian oil sanctions - but no fines have been handed out so far, the BBC can reveal. The identities of the businesses are unknown but it is understood some are likely to be maritime insurance firms. The Treasury said it would take action where appropriate, but pointed to the complexity of the cases as a reason they take considerable time. But Sir William Browder, a longstanding critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said it was an ""embarrassment"" that there had not been a single prosecution or fine for companies investigated for potentially breaching oil sanctions. Financial sanctions on Russia were introduced by the UK and other Western countries following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The sanctions include a cap on the price of Russian oil, designed to ensure that oil can keep flowing without Russia making large profits. The cap prohibits British businesses from facilitating the transportation of Russian oil sold above $60 a barrel. Sir William, who heads the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign, told the BBC the UK ""was one of the most lax enforcers of these types of laws"". He added: ""The UK doesn’t do prosecutions well and I don’t know if that can be fixed overnight.  ""There seems to be both a resource problem and a culture problem when it comes to prosecuting people for economic crimes or sanctions evasion here."" Critics have claimed sanctions are ineffective after the latest figures showed the Russian economy was growing. Data obtained by the BBC using Freedom of Information laws shows the Treasury has opened investigations into 52 companies with a connection to the UK suspected of breaching the price cap since December 2022. As of August, 37 of those investigations were live and 15 had concluded, but no fines had been handed out.  Louis Wilson, the head of fossil fuel investigations at anti-corruption organisation Global Witness said it was “quite astonishing” that no fines have yet been handed out. He described the oil cap as a “a sort of paper tiger” that is failing to crack down on rule breaking. If the UK government “prevents British businesses from enabling Putin's profiteering, then I think you'll start to see others following that lead,” he added. Investigations into potential breaches of the oil cap and other financial sanctions are carried out by a Treasury unit called the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). OFSI received an extra £50m of funding in March to improve enforcement of the UK’s sanctions regime But Mr Wilson said companies under investigation find it “pretty easy to come by” a document that gets them out of trouble. He described the documents as “basically promises, voluntary bits of paper” and said they can be easily obtained even if the company was involved in transporting oil sold above the price cap. “What's likely is either these businesses will find the paperwork that they need to get through this process, or we'll see the UK government drop these cases quietly,” he said. He claimed the US were reluctant to make the Western sanctions regimes harder “because they're scared that if they do enforce the rules it will stop the Russian oil trade and that will send oil prices higher”. Conservative shadow foreign office minister Dame Harriett Baldwin said sanctions were designed to “shut down the sources of finance for Russia's war machine” and “bring this illegal invasion to an end sooner”. She said “there is probably more that could be done” by the government and the oil sector itself “because it does appear that UK importers are still bringing in oil that originated in Russia"".  It is important that when OFSI “find deliberate wrongdoing they are exacting financial penalties,” she added.  A spokesperson for the Treasury said it would take enforcement action ""where appropriate"" and it was ""putting sanction breachers on notice"". They added that the cap was reducing Russia's tax revenues from oil, adding that data from the country's own finance ministry showed a 30% drop last year compared to 2022. The former chair of Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of sanctions on Russia in February. Dame Harriett said she “received evidence that the oil price cap is being evaded by refining Russian oil in refineries based in third countries and then the oil is being exported into the UK.” Earlier this year the BBC reported on claims about how much oil this so-called “loophole” is allowing into the UK. But parliamentary committees are disbanded once an election is called and the findings of the Treasury committee inquiry were never published. It is understood no decision has yet been made as to whether the new Treasury Select Committee will recommence the work. OFSI issued its first Russia-related penalty last month, when it fined a concierge company £15,000 for having a sanctioned individual on its client list. London-based firm Integral Concierge Services was found to have made or received 26 payments that involved a person whose assets have been frozen as part of the Russia sanctions."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4dw7q71g7o,Man charged in Trump assassination plot pleads not guilty,Prosecutors say Ryan Routh was spotted with a rifle as he hid in the bushes near Trump’s golf course in Florida.,30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:38.791397,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course has pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal court. Prosecutors say Ryan Routh, 58, was spotted with a rifle as he hid in the bushes near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach earlier this month. A Secret Service officer protecting the former president allegedly spotted his rifle barrel poking through a fence and opened fire. Routh fled and was later arrested on Interstate 95, a main highway through the state. In addition to the attempted assassination of Trump, Routh has been charged with firearms offences and assaulting an officer. On Monday, Routh appeared in court handcuffed and wearing a brownish prison jumpsuit, according to CBS News, the BBC’s US partner. After each count was read to him, he shook his head in acknowledgment of the charges.  His attorneys entered a plea of not guilty and requested a trial by jury. The hearing lasted around five minutes. If convicted, Routh faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.  An earlier court filing showed that Routh had written a note months ago saying he intended to kill Trump. In a pre-written letter addressed to ""The World"" and sent to an unnamed witness months earlier, Routh appears to pre-empt a failed assassination attempt on the former president. ""I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,"" the letter reads, with the offer of a cash reward to anyone ""who can complete the job"". Routh has been held in prison in Florida since his arrest on 15 September. He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result. He was active in recruiting volunteers to fight in Ukraine’s war against Russia, and had a range of eclectic political views, although he was registered as a Democrat and made anti-Trump posts online. Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life after Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire on the former president during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July. Crooks was shot dead by counter-snipers. The Secret Service, the government agency tasked with protecting the president and other politicians and their family members, came under heavy criticism for allowing a gunman to get so close to the former president. Trump and his allies have complained about his Secret Service detail. On Monday the former president said that his protection had been scaled back, forcing him to hold an event in Wisconsin over the weekend inside, instead of outdoors in a venue with a larger capacity. The Secret Service said it was shortstaffed due to the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The agency is responsible for protecting foreign leaders during US visits, and more than 140 were expected at last week's UN meeting."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr3255gpjgo,"Volunteers dying as Russia’s war dead tops 70,000","More than 70,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine - volunteers now make up the highest number of deaths.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:38.942706,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"More than 70,000 people fighting in Russia’s military have now died in Ukraine, according to data analysed by the BBC. And for the first time, volunteers - civilians who joined the armed forces after the start of the war - now make up the highest number of people killed on the battlefield since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022. Every day, the names of those killed in Ukraine, their obituaries and photographs from their funerals are published across Russia in the media and on social networks. BBC Russian and the independent website Mediazona have collated these names, along with names from other open sources, including official reports.   We checked that the information had been shared by authorities or relatives of the deceased - and that they had been identified as dying in the war. New graves in cemeteries have also helped provide the names of soldiers killed in Ukraine - these are usually marked by flags and wreaths sent by the defence ministry. We have identified the names of 70,112 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher. Some families do not share details of their relatives’ deaths publicly - and our analysis does not include names we were unable to check, or the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Among them, 13,781 were volunteers - about 20% - and fatalities among volunteers now exceed other categories. Former prisoners, who joined up in return for pardons for their crimes, were previously the highest but they now account for 19% of all confirmed deaths. Mobilised soldiers - citizens called up to fight - account for 13%. Since October last year, weekly fatalities of volunteers have not dipped below 100 - and, in some weeks, we have recorded more than 310 volunteer deaths. As for Ukraine - it rarely comments on the scale of its deaths on the battlefield. In February, its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, but estimates based on US intelligence suggest greater losses. The story of Rinat Khusniyarov is typical of many of the volunteer soldiers who died. He was from Ufa in Bashkortostan and had been working two jobs to make ends meet - at a tram depot and a plywood factory. He was 62 years old when he signed his contract with the Russian army in November last year. He survived less than three months of fighting and was killed on 27 February. His obituary, in a local online memorial website, simply called him “a hardworking, decent man”. According to the data we analysed, most of the men signing up come from small towns in parts of Russia where stable, well-paid work is hard to find.  Most appear to have joined up willingly, although some in the republic of Chechnya have told human rights activists and lawyers of coercion and threats. Some of the volunteers have said they did not understand the contracts they were signing had no end date, and have since approached pro-Kremlin journalists to, unsuccessfully, ask them for help ending their service. Salaries in the military can be five to seven times higher than average wages in less affluent parts of the country, plus soldiers get social benefits, including free childcare and tax breaks. One-off payments for people who sign up have also repeatedly risen in value in many parts of Russia. Most of the volunteers dying at the front are aged between 42 and 50. They number 4,100 men in our list of more than 13,000 volunteers. The oldest volunteer killed was 71 years old - a total of 250 volunteers above the age of 60 have died in the war. Soldiers have told the BBC that rising casualties among volunteers are, in part, down to their deployment to the most operationally challenging areas on the front line, notably in the Donetsk region in the east, where they form the backbone of reinforcements for depleted units, Russian soldiers told the BBC. Russia’s “meat grinder” strategy continues unabated, according to Russian soldiers we have spoken to. The term has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. Drone footage shared online shows Russian forces attacking Ukrainian positions with little or no equipment or support from artillery or military vehicles.   Sometimes, hundreds of men have been killed on a single day. In recent weeks, the Russian military have made desperate, but unsuccessful, attempts to seize the eastern Ukrainian towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokrovsk with such tactics. An official study by the primary military medical directorate of the Russian defence ministry says that 39% of soldiers’ deaths are a result of limb injuries and that mortality rates would be significantly improved if first aid and subsequent medical care were better. The Russian government’s actions suggests it is keen to avoid forcing people to fight through a new, official wave of mobilisation - instead, it is ramping up calls for service volunteers, along with the incentives to do so. Remarks by regional officials in local parliaments suggest they have been tasked from the top with trying to recruit people from their local districts. They advertise on job vacancy websites, contact men who have debt and bailiff problems, and conduct recruitment campaigns in higher education establishments. Since 2022, convicted prisoners have also been encouraged to join up in return for their release, but now a new policy means people facing criminal prosecution can accept a deal to go to war instead of facing trial in court. In return, their cases are frozen and potentially dropped altogether. A small number of the volunteers killed have been from other countries. We have identified the names of 272 such men, many of whom were from Central Asia - 47 from Uzbekistan, 51 from Tajikistan, and 26 from Kyrgyzstan. Last year saw reports of Russia recruiting people in Cuba, Iraq, Yemen and Serbia. Foreigners already living in Russia without valid work permits or visas, who agree to “work for the state”, are promised they will not be deported and are offered a simplified route to citizenship if they survive the war. Many have later complained that they did not understand the paperwork - as with Russian citizens, they have turned to the media for help. The governments of India and Nepal have called on Moscow to stop sending their citizens to Ukraine and repatriate the bodies of the dead. So far, the calls have not been acted upon. Many new recruits who have joined the military have criticised the training they have received. A man who signed a contract with the Russian army in November last year told the BBC he had been promised two weeks of training at a shooting range before deployment to the front. ""In reality, people were just thrown out onto the parade ground, and dished out some gear,” he said, adding the equipment was poorly made. “We were loaded on to trains, then trucks, and sent to the front. About half of us were thrown into battle straight from the road. As a result, some people went from the recruitment office to the front line in just a week,” he said. Samuel Cranny-Evans, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in the UK says: “Basic understanding of things like camouflage and concealment or how to move quietly at night, how to move without creating a profile for yourself during the day,” should be taught as basic infantry skills. Another soldier also told the BBC that equipment is a problem, saying it “varies, but most often it's some random set of uniforms, standard boots that wear out within a day, and a kit bag with a label showing it was made in the mid-20th Century”. “A random bulletproof vest and a cheap helmet. It's impossible to fight in this. If you want to survive, you have to buy your own equipment.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5y23qgx0qo,Japanese atomic bomb survivors win Nobel Peace Prize,"Nihon Hidankyo, a group of survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is recognised for its work to rid the world of nuclear weapons.",3 days ago,2024-10-14 18:26:39.115541,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese group of atomic bomb survivors, has won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. Known as hibakusha, the survivors of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been recognised by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Nobel Committee Chair Joergen Watne Frydnes said the group had ""contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo"". Mr Frydnes warned the ""nuclear taboo"" was now ""under pressure"" - and praised the group's use of witness testimony to ensure nuclear weapons must never be used again. Founded in 1956, the organisation sends survivors around the world to share their testimonies of the ""atrocious damage"" and suffering caused by the use of nuclear weapons, according to its website. Their work began almost a decade after the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 6 August 1945, a US bomber dropped the uranium bomb above the city of Hiroshima, killing around 140,000 people. Three days later a second nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan's surrender, announced by Emperor Hirohito shortly afterwards, ended World War Two. Speaking to reporters in Japan, a tearful Toshiyuki Mimaki, the co-head of the group, said: ""Never did I dream this could happen,"" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. Mr Mimaki criticised the idea that nuclear weapons bring peace. ""It has been said that because of nuclear weapons, the world maintains peace. But nuclear weapons can be used by terrorists,"" Mr Mimaki said, according to reports by AFP. In a BBC interview last year, he said despite only being three years old at the time the nuclear bomb hit Hiroshima - he could still remember dazed and burnt survivors fleeing past his home. The prize - which consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a sum of $1m (£765,800) - will be presented at a ceremonies in Oslo in December, marking the anniversary of the death of the scientist and prize creator Alfred Nobel. The group has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize ""many times"" in the past, including in 2005 when it received a special mention by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, its website says. The decision to recognise Nihon Hidankyo means the Nobel committee has steered away from more controversial nominees for the peace prize. There had been widespread speculation the United Nations agency supporting Palestinians – UNRWA – was being considered for the prize.  Although the organisation is the main provider of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, nine of its members were fired for alleged involvement in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 last year.  More than 12,000 people had signed a petition urging the committee not to award UNRWA the prize.  There were equal concerns about the nomination of the International Court of Justice.  The UN’s main judicial organ is currently considering allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and has already issued a statement urging the Israeli authorities to refrain from genocidal acts. But while giving the prize to Nihon Hidankyo may be a non-controversial choice, it could also focus global attention on the threat of nuclear conflict which overshadows the fighting in both Ukraine and the Middle East.  Throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its leaders have repeatedly hinted that they may be ready to use tactical nuclear weapons if western allies increase their support for Ukraine in a way Russia considers unacceptable. These threats have succeeded in restraining western support for fear of escalation.  In the Middle East, the subtext for much of Israel’s strategy is the fear that Iran is seeking nuclear capability, something Tehran denies.  The Nobel committee’s decision may renew a debate about the use of nuclear weapons at a time when some countries look enviously at their deterring power. This year's peace prize had 286 nominations, a number comprising 197 individuals and 89 organisations. Nominations can be made by people in positions of significant authority, including members of national assemblies, governments and international courts of law. Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi won the prize in 2023, when she was honoured for her work fighting the oppression of women in Iran. Ms Mohammadi is currently being held in Evin prison in Tehran, having already spent 12 years in jail serving multiple sentences related to her activism."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6ve2x72xo,'Please save me': The Indians duped into fighting for Russia,Dozens of Indian men have been discharged from the Russian army and are making their way home.,18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:39.253371,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Last week, the Indian government announced that Russia had discharged dozens of the 91 Indians who were duped into fighting for Russian forces in the country's war with Ukraine. Several of them have since returned home, while the process to bring others back is under way. The BBC's Neyaz Farooquee spoke to some of the men about their struggles.  “I am in panic. I am not sure if I will return safely or in a box. Please save me.” This is the message Urgen Tamang, a former Indian soldier, sent to the BBC from outside a southern Ukrainian city, a few days before he was discharged from the frontlines in Russia’s war against Ukraine, which entered its third year this February. Mr Tamang is among the 91 Indians who were forced into fighting in the war. Most of them are from poor families and were lured by agents with the promise of money and jobs, sometimes as ""helpers"" in the Russian army. Instead, they were sent to the war zone. Many of them said they were stationed in parts of Ukraine under Russian control, where they had to navigate landmines, drones, missiles and sniper attacks with little to no military training. Nine Indians have died in the conflict so far and Indian authorities say they have arrested 19 people for human trafficking. In July, Russia promised an early release of all Indians fighting in its army, following a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Moscow, during which he raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin. The two countries have traditionally shared a warm relationship. Forty-five of them have been discharged since then. Some have safely returned home, while others like Mr Tamang are on their way. ""I can't believe I am out of there,"" said Sunil Karwa, an electrician from Rajasthan who joined the Russian army in February. Posted near Bakhmut, an eastern Ukraine city that has seen intense fighting, he was at the Moscow airport waiting to board his flight when he spoke to the BBC. Mr Karwa described scenes of deaths and destruction, a reality which hit him the hardest when a man from his neighbouring village was shot on the battlefield.   “They sent him back on the frontline 15 days after the injury and he fainted in the field. He is paralysed now,” he said. Like him, most of the other recruits were also blue-collar workers aged between 19 and 35, who were hired by agents based in India, Dubai and Russia.  They say their contracts were in Russian, a language they didn't understand. Yet they signed it in the hope of getting better opportunities.   ""The process was so quick - just a few signatures and photos and we were in [the army],"" Mr Karwa said.  Raja Pathan joined the army as a last resort in February, after an education consultant deceived him into enrolling in a non-existent college.  “When I got there, I saw banners advertising recruitments for the army. By then, I had spent so much time and money that I decided to join anyway,” he said. It was the death of two friends, which eventually pushed Mr Pathan to leave. He was released in August with the help of a sympathetic Russian commander who facilitated his exit.  Now based in Moscow, he helps other Indians escape from there. Mohammad Sufyan from the southern state of Telangana returned to India on 12 September with five other men.  Safe in his home, he carries the trauma of surviving on the frontline. ""There was little rest there and in the beginning, I couldn't speak to my family for 25 days,"" he said.  The most scarring moment came in February when his friend Hemil Mangukiya - an Indian man from Gujarat state - was killed right before his eyes.  “He was merely 15 metres from me, digging a trench near Krynky [in Kherson], when a missile landed,” recalled Mr Sufyan. “I put his dead body in the truck with my own hands.”  “After seeing the dead body of my friend, I didn’t have the strength for anything,"" he added.  After the death, Mr Sufyan and other Indians stuck there released a video pleading for help, which reached Indian MP Asaduddin Owaisi, who raised the matter with the foreign ministry. Families of the men had also appealed to the Indian government for help in bringing them back.  ""It is a miracle I got back home,"" said Azad Yusuf Kumar, a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, who was part of Mr Sufyan's group in the army.   “One minute you are digging a trench, and the next, an artillery falls and burns everything down. It was all a matter of luck if it fell on you or someone else.” In February, Mr Kumar had told the BBC how he had shot his foot by mistake during training. “My commander kept saying, use your right hand to shoot, use your left hand to shoot, shoot above, shoot down,” he had said. ""I had never touched a gun. It was extremely cold, and with the gun in my left hand, I ended up shooting my foot.” Now back in Kashmir, he talks about how his commander had accused him of deliberately shooting himself to avoid going to the frontline.  ""But I am lucky I did not go to fight. Four men from my camp died in an attack at that time. I could've been one of them,"" he said.  Though recent discharges brought relief to many, those still in Russia face growing desperation as their release is delayed. Mr Tamang, who joined the Russian army in January, had earlier told The Indian Express newspaper through his local councillor, Rabi Pradhan, that 13 out of 15 non-Russian members of his unit had died. The fact that he was sent to the frontline at least twice after signing his discharge letter in August heightened his fears – and mistrust in the process. On 15 September, he was on his way to Moscow but still doubtful if he was truly heading home. “I am out, but I will keep sending you my location,” he said. When he last texted, he had left Ukraine, hoping to continue his journey home. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29z3e5117o,"In Ukraine, Trump plot suspect remembered as 'delusional'","Ryan Routh had an ""unhealthy"" fixation on the war, despite being rejected by Ukraine’s International Legion.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:39.374052,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“We can’t say why we’re here, it’s top secret!” I’d never asked what the drunk British man in strange military fatigues was doing in a Ukrainian cafe, but he was keen to tell me regardless. It was the summer of 2022, and dotted across Kyiv’s main Khreshchatyk Street were similar types who all claimed they were joining Ukraine’s war effort against Russia. “War attracts all sorts,” I thought.  We now know they included Ryan Routh, the suspect in an apparent attempted assassination of Donald Trump in the US on Sunday. Routh “was an omnipresent dude” in the Ukrainian capital, remarks Chris Lutz, an aid worker who met him several times. “I wouldn’t call him crazy,” he says. “He was trying his best to help Ukraine, but it was getting to an unhealthy level.”  Ukrainian officials have firmly distanced themselves from the man accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump at the former president's Florida golf course. Routh, 58, had repeatedly tried to recruit foreign soldiers for the Ukrainian military, but was unsuccessful. “He has never served in Ukraine’s International Legion and has no relation to the unit,” said the legion's spokesperson. The American reportedly contacted the legion on a regular basis with ideas described by one Ukrainian soldier as “nonsensical” and “delusional”. The suspect had also admitted to being turned down himself, claiming it was down to his age and lack of fighting experience. In an online post reacting to the events in the US over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was “glad” Donald Trump was unharmed.  There was no mention of the suspect who’d been a staunch supporter of Zelensky's country - and for good reason. Three days after Russia’s full-scale invasion, Zelensky called for ""friends of peace and democracy"" to join the fight from abroad, and they did so in their thousands. Ukraine’s International Legion was born. It was initially thought 20,000 volunteers were willing to sign up. Experts now think there are more than 4,000 foreign fighters in Ukraine. Despite the fact Routh failed in his attempts to add to that number, his arrest in Florida has still given Kyiv a headache. Lt Andriy Kovalenko, who’s from Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, warned Russia would use the assassination attempt for propaganda purposes. “Playing with fire has its consequences,” was the response from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov when asked whether Ukraine could have been behind the plot. On Russian state TV, host Olga Skabeyeva called Routh a “crazed fan of Zelensky, walking around with a machine gun”. “There has been another attempt on Donald’s life, and the attempt is officially linked to Ukraine,” she added, making reference to an earlier effort by a gunman in Pennsylvania to shoot Trump in July. A popular pro-Russian Telegram channel in Ukraine claimed the Ukrainian intelligence service was behind the assassination attempt. A similar account said the American had travelled to Ukraine to “recruit American mercenaries”. No evidence has accompanied these claims. “Of course, all this is a lie,” said Lt Kovalenko. “But information confrontation is a component of the war.” Sandra Andersen Eira, a Norwegian national fighting with the Ukrainian Marine Corps on the southern front line, says she is puzzled. “My only question is: how did he get rejected by the International Foreign Legion?” she asks.  She says that until last May there was very little vetting. A minimum contract of six months and basic training have since been brought in. Recruits still don’t have to have any military experience, though some consider this to be an advantage. “Routh was just another one of those types,” Ms Eira says.  “You had characters fundraising, scamming people, claiming to be in the front lines, with a unit, and then they're not. “Some volunteers have good intentions and really want to make a difference, but maybe they're just not mentally or physically fit for it. Some of them are just delusional.” Perhaps this applied to Ryan Routh. He might not have helped Ukraine, but his time in the country has given it an unwelcome connection to an assassination attempt on a US presidential candidate.

Arlette Gondree hosts an annual service of remembrance for veterans at the Cafe Gondree in Benouville, Normandy. Her family became the first to be liberated from the Germans in June 1944. Madame Arlette, as she is known by the veterans, will be named a Chevalier of France’s National Order of Merit at a ceremony at the cafe on 5 October.  She said she was ""moved and honoured"" to be receiving the recognition of the French government.  The former patron of Birmingham Normandy Veterans Association said she felt ""more anglophile than French,"" also being involved with schools and associations across the West Midlands, originally travelling to the area from a young girl to this day.  She now spends much of her year in Warwickshire. ""I feel like a bridge linking the British and French people,"" she added.  She was four years old when British troops entered the family cafe, ending their occupation.  Her parents Georges and Thérèse had been members of the French Resistance, gleaning information from the Germans who used the cafe and passing it on to British intelligence.  Shortly after liberation her father dug up champagne he had hidden in his garden, offering it to the Allied troops.  Ever since, a toast to D-Day veterans has been held at the precise moment of 23:16 German time, that British troops entered the cafe on 5 June.   This year's ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, had been ""very special,"" she said.  ""My great sadness was there were not as many veterans of the time,"" she added.  ""But many young British soldiers had attended."" Madame Arlette said she had received many letters congratulating her on the award, including one ""very moving"" one from the French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu, who had proposed her decoration.  In it, he said she was being ""recognised for the great quality to perpetrate the history of this emblematic cafe"". ""I send you all my very best congratulations,"" he concluded.  She said it was ""very moving"" to receive the award in the 80th anniversary year.  ""And I also feel that it is to be shared with my parents who instigated it,"" she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78dwepw95do,Ukraine bans Telegram use on state-issued devices,"The ban affects government officials and military personnel, over concerns about Russian cyber-attacks.",21 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:39.690900,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine has banned the use of the Telegram messaging platform on official devices issued to government and military personnel, as well as defence sector and critical infrastructure employees. The country's powerful National Security and Defence Council (Rnbo) said this was done to ""minimise"" threats posed by Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ""Telegram is actively used by the enemy for cyber-attacks, the distribution of phishing and malicious software, user geolocation and missile strike correction,"" the Rnbo said on Friday. In a statement to the BBC, Telegram said it has ""never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia"". Telegram is widely used by the government and the military in both Ukraine and Russia. In a statement, the Rnbo said the ban was agreed at a meeting of Ukraine's top information security officials, the military as well as lawmakers. It said military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov had presented credible evidence of Russian special services' ability to access personal correspondence of Telegram users, even their deleted messages. ""I have always supported and continue to support freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,"" Budanov was quoted as saying. The Rnbo said that those officials for whom the use of Telegram was part of their work duties would be exempt from the ban. Separately, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Rnbo's centre on countering disinformation, stressed the ban only applied to official devices - not personal smartphones. He added that government officials and military personnel would be able to continue to maintain and update their official Telegram pages. Last year, a USAID-Internews survey found that Telegram was the top social platform in Ukraine for news consumption, with 72% of Ukrainians using it. Telegram - which offers end-to-end encryption - was co-founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov and his brother in 2013. A year later, Durov left Russia after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform. Last month, Durov, who is also a French national, was placed under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime.  His case has fuelled a debate about freedom of speech, accountability and how platforms moderate content. In July, Durov claimed that Telegram reached 950 million monthly active users. Following Ukraine's claims, a spokesperson for Telegram said the company would be ""interested in reviewing any evidence that supports Mr Budanov's claims"", adding that ""to our knowledge, no such evidence exists"". ""Telegram has never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia,"" the spokesperson added. Telegram also said ""deleted messages are deleted forever and are technically impossible to recover"". The firm added that ""every instance of supposed 'leaked messages' Telegram has investigated has been the result of a compromised device, whether through confiscation or malware""."

Gary Fear, from Gnosall, Staffordshire, will be setting off for the eastern European country on Tuesday, where he will buy food and other essentials for people affected by the war. Mr Fear made his first visit Ukraine in April 2022. He has raised more than £92,000 in donations since launching an online fundraiser shortly before that first trip. Speaking to BBC Radio Stoke, Mr Fear said the support from people had been “incredible”. He will be taking a total of £14,000 with him on Tuesday, which he said would pay for an “awful lot of food” and at least one generator for a village left without electricity as a result of the war. “When I do think about it, it’s quite humbling,” he said. “When you see the expression on the face of someone you hand some food to, or when they start crying because someone has taken the trouble to do that... it makes it all worthwhile.” Asked what the situation was like on the ground in Ukraine, he said it had been “getting worse”. “We’ve been to places where we’ve had to leave because the village we were in was being shelled,” he said. “We’ve seen more and more atrocities in terms of damaged buildings and people being displaced.” He added that it was “fabulous” to see so many people in Staffordshire come together to raise money to aid Ukrainians in their plight. Mr Fear revealed he was also planning a 10th trip to the country in January next year. Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30lp1qq6pzo,Ukraine drone attack in Russia sparks fire,Residents are being encouraged to return home after a partial evacuation was ordered.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:48.755817,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Thirteen people have been injured in Russia's Tver region after a large Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire there, according to the Russian health ministry.  Unverified footage has emerged purportedly showing a massive blast in the town of Toropets. Video footage circulating on social media showed detonations and smoke covering a large stretch of sky. A partial evacuation of the region was ordered after the strike in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The regional governor later encouraged residents to return, saying that all infrastructure in the town was working normally again. AFP and Reuters news agencies have quoted Ukrainian sources as saying a major ammunitions depot had been struck. The military site reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as artillery shells, ballistic missiles, and explosives, in a series of warehouses. These are all weapons that have been used in Russia’s relentless full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This latest attack by Ukraine is the kind it has been wanting to carry out with missiles supplied by its western allies. However, in the absence of approval from the US and UK, it has once again hit Russian targets with drones it has made itself. The target this time, though, is significant. A military arsenal, worth almost £30m ($39m), has seemingly gone up in a series of explosions. Nasa reported a series of heat sources from satellite imagery.  A light-magnitude earthquake was even reported in the surrounding Tver region. The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that in addition to its own ammunition, including Grad rockets, Russia had also started to store North Korean missiles in Toropets. None of these claims have been verified by the BBC.  Without naming any specific targets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his video address late on Wednesday: ""There is a significant outcome from last night on the territory of Russia, and this is the type of action that weakens the enemy.  ""I thank all those involved. Such inspiring precision."" Toropets lies about 380km (236 miles) north-west of Russia's capital Moscow, and some 470km north of the border with Ukraine. Over the past few months, Kyiv has grown in confidence and ambition as it has ramped up drone attacks inside Russia. It’s struck as far as 1,800km (1,118 miles) in the past, when a long-range radar was hit in the city of Orsk. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the authorities in Toropets said buses had already been prepared for the evacuation.  They also claimed the situation was ""under control"" in the town of about 13,000 residents. The authorities did not say how many people were being evacuated. Meanwhile, Russia's state media reported that regional schools and kindergartens would be closed on Wednesday. The level of destruction in Toropets will give Ukrainian forces a much-needed morale boost. It is also hoped it sends the West a political message - that targeting sites inside Russia helps Ukraine defend itself, and will not cause an escalation with Moscow. Russia's defence ministry reported on Wednesday that it had destroyed a total of 54 drones in overnight attacks across five Russian regions - Bryansk, Kursk, Oryol, Smolensk and Belgorod. Belgorod Region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said four civilians were injured in a ""drone attack on a minibus"" in the city of Shebekino. Ukraine has not commented on the reported attacks. Also overnight, Ukrainian air defences were engaged against oncoming Russian drones near the capital Kyiv, city military administration head Serhiy Popko said.  There were also reports of blasts in Ukraine's north-eastern city of Sumy, near the Russian border, and the regional authorities later 16 drones were shot down. However, the authorities were forced to use back-up power systems after energy infrastructure repeatedly come under fire. In total, the Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 46 of 52 drones launched by Moscow over the country overnight. Local authorities said one person was killed in the central region of Kirovohrad, while a 90-year-old woman was wounded in Kropyvnytskyi. The claims by both Russian and Ukrainian officials have not been independently verified. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2g0rrxwdo,UK tour for Ukrainian sand animation artist,"Oksana Merhut brings stories to life in sand, on stage with music and storytelling.",20 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:48.894251,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"An internationally acclaimed artist, who creates moving pictures in sand, is bringing the art form to the UK for the first time. Ukrainian Oksana Merhut, known as the Sand Fairy, is touring with her unique animation show to raise money for the Ukrainian armed forces.  Ms Merhut is performing at Trinity Centre, in Bristol on 20 September, with performances also planned in Swansea, Cardiff, Goathurst, Taunton, Manchester, Yeovil and London.  Ms Merhut, speaking through an interpreter, said audiences have so far been ""amazed"", adding that ""many had never seen sand animation live before"". The show has received rave reviews at 3,000 events across Europe, the US, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Sand animation started gaining popularity in Ukraine in 2006, although it dates back to ancient times when Australian Aboriginals, the Navajo Indians and Tibetan monks used sand and crushed gemstones to create paintings.  Ms Merhut first mastered the art form in 2014 and wrote the first professional teaching program. ""That’s when the most interesting part began,"" she said. ""Exploring, along with my students, this new medium and the possibilities of conveying information and emotions through sand as an unique artistic and therapeutic tool."" Ms Merhut started creating and performing her own shows featuring animations on various themes, set to music. When the war with Russia began, Ms Merhut began working with children who had been displaced.  ""I noticed that children enjoyed it, and beyond that, it had a healing effect, influencing people's mental states,"" she said.  ""We held workshops, presented sand shows, and provided therapeutic support."" Suitable for people ""aged four to 104"", the show consists of two acts; the first brings to life the story of Oscar Wilde's The Star-Child with audio narration in both Ukrainian and English. The second, titled A Prayer for Ukraine, is the artist's interpretations of current events aimed to raise awareness about the war in her home country.  Antonina Grebeniuk, founder of Ukraine Aid and Welfare, which is hosting the Bristol show, said: ""We expect the audience to be deeply moved, as her art beautifully portrays the reality of Ukraine’s struggles in an artistic and meaningful way."" All funds raised at the event on 20 September will go to support Ukraine. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr75r70jgp7o,Ukraine missile request under discussion - Lammy,Ukraine has been pleading for months for restrictions on using missiles on targets inside Russia to be lifted.,15 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:49.080426,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The foreign secretary has insisted no single weapon can win a war, as he said the UK was still discussing with allies whether to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Russia.  David Lammy told the BBC it was important that countries supporting Ukraine had ""a shared strategy to win"".  Ukraine already has supplies of long-range missiles from the UK, the United States and France but at the moment it is only allowed to fire them at targets within its own borders.  President Zelensky has been pleading for months for these restrictions to be lifted so Ukraine can use them against targets inside Russia. There have been strong indications that the US and UK are poised to change their position.  However, no confirmation came after talks between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden in Washington on Wednesday.  Pressed over whether the delay in lifting restrictions on the use of long-range missiles was emboldening Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Lammy told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""No war is won with any one weapon."" He refused to confirm whether the UK and its allies were planning to allow missiles to be used against targets in Russia.  But he added: ""This is under careful discussion with the Ukrainians, as we assess what they need as they head into the winter."" Lammy said the UK and other allies would be meeting President Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in less than 12 days' times and suggested the issue would be discussed then.  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Ukraine should be allowed to use long-range missiles to attack military bases inside Russia, even if the UK had to act ""unilaterally"".  Asked whether the UK would ""go it alone"" and lift restrictions without US support, Lammy told the BBC ""it’s important that as allies supporting Ukraine we have a shared strategy to win going forward"".  Gen Sir John McColl, former deputy supreme allied commander Europe of Nato, said he believed Ukraine would eventually be allowed to use long-range missiles against targets in Russia. But he told the programme Ukraine’s allies needed to be ""firm"" and ""not signal this kind of dither and dilemma"". ""At the end of the weekend President Putin will be encouraged and emboldened and President Zelensky will be disappointed,"" he said. However, Sir John said the missiles would have only ""a limited effect"" on the war as a whole. A number of former Conservative defence secretaries, including Ben Wallace, have urged the PM to lift restrictions. On Saturday, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the delays and wrangling over the decision were only benefitting President Putin. Earlier this week President Putin warned Western nations against allowing Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Russia, saying this would represent ""direct participation"" by Nato in the war. Ukraine’s allies have been reluctant to do anything which could drag them into direct conflict with Moscow. Lammy accused the Russian president of ""throwing dust up into the air"" by making such threats. ""There’s a lot of bluster – that’s his modus operandi,"" he said. ""We cannot be blown off course by an imperialist fascist."" Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under regular bombardment. Many of these missiles are launched by aircraft deep inside Russia and Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself. On Sunday, President Zelensky posted a fresh plea on social media, writing: ""This week, the Russians have launched around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine. ""Ukraine needs strong support from our partners to defend lives against Russian terror - air defence, long-range capabilities, support for our warriors. Everything that will help force Russia to end this war."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg211yy9r6o,Dreaming of diamonds: Generations dig for fortune in India's gem town,"In Panna, families hunt for diamonds hoping to strike rich and escape the cycle of poverty.",14 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:26:49.279610,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“I feel sick if I don’t search for diamonds. It’s like a drug.” Prakash Sharma, 67, speaks about diamonds with a passion that has defined his life for the past five decades. A diamond hunter in India’s central state of Madhya Pradesh, he spends most of his day in the mines of Panna district. Panna is among the country’s most backward regions - its residents face poverty, water scarcity, and unemployment. But it's also home to most of India’s diamond reserves and remains a prime destination for diamond hunters. While most mines are managed by the federal government, state officials lease out small parts of land to prospective miners every year at nominal prices. The district has the country’s only mechanised diamond mine. However, once known for its large and rare finds, diamond mines of Panna are rundown now. Its reserves have depleted due to over-mining over the years. Despite this decline, hopeful miners continue their quest. They have to hand over their finds to the government diamond office, which evaluates the stones and sells them in an auction.  After deducting royalties and taxes, the proceeds are sent back to the miners, a bittersweet reward for their tireless digging. Mr Sharma says he began digging for diamonds in 1974, right after he finished school, following in the footsteps of his father who was once a famous diamond hunter in his village. He soon hit the jackpot after he found a six-carat diamond, which was worth a fortune 50 years ago. That, he says, fuelled a passion in him to keep searching for more. ""I wanted to continue doing this instead of getting a low-paying government job,"" he says. Mr Sharma is among thousands of men - young and old - who spend their days in the mines, hoping to strike rich and escape the cycle of poverty. The miners start digging through gravel in the early hours of the morning. They then wash, dry and sift through it looking for diamonds until sunset. Their families help them in their work. It's a physically demanding task - but for the people of Panna, it's an intrinsic part of their lives, conversations and hopes for a better future. For many, diamond hunting is a family tradition passed down through generations. Shyamlal Jatav, 58, comes from one such family. His grandfather started the work and now his son continues it, balancing his studies while working part-time in the mines. Mr Jatav says his grandfather found many diamonds, but in those days, they did not sell for much. But things are different now, with some of these stones selling for tens of millions of rupees. Raja Gound is among the few who got lucky. A labourer by profession, he was neck-deep in debt when he found a massive 19.22-carat diamond in July. He sold the diamond at a government auction for about 8m rupees ($95,178; £72,909). Mr Gound said he had been leasing mines for more than 10 years in the hope of finding a diamond. India has always played a key role in the diamond industry. For more than 3,000 years, it was the world's sole diamond source. This changed in the 18th Century with discoveries in Brazil and South Africa. But Panna's legacy as a hub for diamonds has endured.  The district's Majhgawan mine, operated by the state-controlled National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), is the country’s only organised source of diamond production. NMDC began mining in 1968 and by 2024, it had extracted over 1.3 million carats of diamonds. Though anyone can mine diamonds in Panna - that too at a cheap price - most hunters avoid taking the official route to sell their treasure. Several residents told BBC Hindi that there was a big market for illegally mined diamonds - but the exact figures of the trade are unknown. A black-market dealer, who did not want to be named, said people sell their finds illegally to avoid taxes and to ensure quick payments. “If they go through official channels, they only get paid after the diamond is sold at auction, which can sometimes take years,” he said. Ravi Patel, Panna’s mining officer, says authorities have taken measures to curb illegal sales but it's difficult to track them because most of the diamonds mined are relatively small and do not fetch high prices. Officials admit that there has been a decline in the number of diamonds deposited for government auctions. In 2016, the office received 1,133 diamonds, but the numbers shrank to just 23 in 2023. Anupam Singh, a government diamond evaluator in Panna, says restrictions on mining are behind this decline. ""The forest department has marked off significant zones, turning them into no-go areas for diamond hunters,” Mr Singh said. There are more than 50 tigers living in the Panna Tiger Reserve and recent government efforts to preserve their population has presented many challenges to the miners. Diamond miners who once operated within forested areas, including the buffer zone of the reserve, are prohibited from mining there and risk facing severe penalties if caught. But despite the hardships and challenges, thousands of men continue to work in the shallow mines, hoping to overturn their fate. Prakash Majumdar started digging for diamonds in 2020 after the Covid-19 lockdown took away all the labour and farming jobs in his hometown. Desperate and struggling to feed his family, Mr Majumdar found his first diamond worth 2.9m rupees within a month of mining. A lot has changed since - his family has now moved to a concrete home and he has become the elected village head. Yet, his relentless quest for more continues. “Diamond hunting will remain a part of my life and I am not going anywhere until I strike it rich,” he said."

The organisation posted messages on its social media accounts in Mandarin, Farsi and Korean on Wednesday, instructing users how to contact it securely. This latest effort follows a campaign to enlist Russians in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, which the CIA says was a success. ""We want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business,"" a CIA spokesman said in a statement. The recruitment messages - which were placed on platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram and LinkedIn, as well as on the dark web - asked for individuals' names, locations and contact details. Detailed instructions advised users to contact the CIA via its official website using trusted encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or an anonymous web browser known as the Tor network, which is often used to access the dark web. ""I can't remember any sort of recruitment effort like this, using YouTube or social media in this way, at least in Korean,"" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. ""It seems like they're basing this off the success they had in Russia - but I would question how effective this will be considering most North Koreans don't have access to the internet,"" he told the BBC. Professor Richey suggested that the United States may be targeting North Korean traders who informally cross the border with China and might be able to access VPN networks. US intelligence considers North Korea, Iran and China ""hard targets"" when it comes to intelligence gathering, given the harsh level of surveillance all countries employ to stamp out dissent. ""This effort represents just one way in which CIA is adapting to a new global environment of increased state repression and global surveillance,"" the spy agency's statement continued. But Professor Richey questioned the value of any intelligence that the campaign might be able to gather. ""I suppose you have to assume the CIA knows what it's doing, but you do wonder how many of these discontented people are close enough to power and close enough to the places where important decisions are made,"" he said. ""It does, at the very least though, throw some sand in the gears of these counter-intelligence operations,"" he added. American intelligence chiefs, encouraged by efforts in Russia, are nonetheless confident they will reach enough dissatisfied citizens who are willing to contact them with potentially useful information. ""There are plenty of people who have access to information and who are disaffected from the Xi regime in China,"" CIA Deputy Director David Cohen told Bloomberg. ""You’ve got people inside who... for lots of different motivations fundamentally do not like the direction that Xi is taking the country and understand that there’s a path to helping their own country by working with us,"" he added. Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesman, said the US was waging ""an organised and systematic"" disinformation campaign against China. ""Any attempts to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) or to weaken their close bond will inevitably fail,"" Mr Liu said in a statement. In rolling out a campaign of this scale across different countries, Dr Richey said the United States was giving a good indication of how it sees its national security challenges.  ""The US is now convinced that it's in not just a series of bilateral confrontations with China and Russia and Iran and North Korea - but rather, it's in a confrontation with an emerging bloc,"" said Professor Richey.  ""Which obviously recalls a sense of the Cold War."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e957v9pyeo,Graphic novel shows unconventional routes into science,"Prof Liston hopes the stories show the ""many different pathways"".",28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:49.620381,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Stories of people's unconventional routes to becoming scientists are told in a new graphic novel intended to encourage others into the field. The book - Becoming a Scientist - is aimed at young adult readers and was written by the University of Cambridge's Prof Adrian Liston, and illustrated by Yulia Lapko - a business administrator for the pathology department. Both their routes could be deemed unconventional as Prof Liston was expected to join his truck-driving family's business in Australia, while Ms Lapko fled her native Ukraine in 2022 following invasion. Prof Liston said as a youngster he did not even know what a scientist was, and hoped the stories showed the ""many different pathways"". The novel told the stories of  12 members of the Liston-Dooley lab, who researched  the immune system and tissues during pathology. This was not Prof Liston's first book and he has written books for young children including All about Coronavirus, Battle Robots of the Blood and Maya’s Marvellous Medicine. His graphic novel, however, was aimed at older readers between 12 and 18 years of age. ""It was really luck more than anything else that allowed me to fall into the career I have today,"" Prof Liston said.  ""When I looked around the amazing people in my lab, I realised that everyone had a story about overcoming barriers to enter science."" Prof Lipton freely admits he was not brought up to be a scientist. In the book, he said: ""I grew up in a truck-driving family in Australia. ""My parents didn't get the chance to finish high school and the only jobs I heard about were driving trucks or working the factory line building cars."" He added: ""I never met a scientist. Actually, if I hadn't been inspired by the weekly nature documentary on TV I'd never have known being a scientist was possible."" Studying at university was ""an epiphany for me"", the professor said. ""Sure, there was class snobbery, but I was also able to find my group who were weird like me."" He told the BBC: ""I want to see more kids with grit and creativity really look seriously at science as a potential career, and I realised that my team here at Cambridge really demonstrated just how diverse scientists are in practice.  ""Every one had their own story of adversity conquered, their own role-models and their own motivations, so I thought we could simply tell their stories.  ""While each one is unique, together they do show that science can be for anybody, and science becomes richer for having a diversity of talents."" Other stories included those of Magda Ali, who is completing her PhD at Cambridge University. Her parents came to the UK as refugees from Somalia and although she attended a school where few students even took A-levels, she continued her studies and her dream of becoming a scientist. Visiting student researcher Alvaro Hernandez said he failed his school entrance tests in Peru at the age of five and almost did not get an education at all, having been preoccupied instead with football. ""I think my early teachers would be surprised to see me in Cambridge,"" he said in the book. Their diverse stories have been illustrated by Yulia Lapko, who came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She had been working as an artist before the war, but on arriving in Cambridge, and added: ""I took a break from that because, settling in the new country, it made sense to get a full-time job for a sense of security and stability. Now that I feel settled enough I can expand the possibilities of what I can do with my skills. ""I really enjoy being here, I love the department and its people. ""Drawing people is my main speciality in art, and all the people featured in the book I actually see every day, which made it easier to capture them in a way that feels alive and effortless.  ""But it’s one thing to see what people look like and the other is to really see them, to know the story behind each individual, so having all of them share their backgrounds, hopes and wishes really helped to get the whole picture of each character."" Prof Liston added: ""It is guts and heart rather than brains that lead to scientific breakthroughs, and every discovery worth making happens from a team.""

Lord Graham Brady presided over the influential backbench group for 14 years and saw five prime ministers and major events such as Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Lord Brady, who has called his memoir Kingmaker, said he learned ""early on"" to keep his counsel in the role, but there were now ""important things to get on record"". He said he also wanted to ""dispel some myths"", as some people had used his taciturn approach ""to speculate and claim certain things"". Born in Salford in 1967, Lord Brady first became active in the Conservative Party aged just 16.  In 1997, shortly before his 30th birthday, he was elected MP for Altrincham and Sale West in Greater Manchester, becoming what was then the party's youngest MP. In 2010, he was elected chairman of the 1922 Committee, a role he held unchallenged for 14 years making him the longest serving chairman in the committee's history. The group - known in Westminster as the ""men in grey suits"" - meets weekly and discusses the view of the party's backbench MPs. He was known for keeping his opinions private during his time at the head of the committee. He said that was the only way he could do the job without betraying confidences. His time in the post took in the tenures of five prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. He said he sought to offer them all his counsel as the 1922 Committee chairman, who was elected by their fellow MPs, was ""the only adviser they have whom they haven't appointed"". ""That ought to be seen as something which is quite valuable, in that it's a different source of advice from somebody who doesn't actually owe them for their position,"" he said. He said some of his advice had been listened to, while other suggestions were ignored. He said there were a number of instances when he and Lord Cameron ""fell out"" over various things, but added that on the whole, he was a ""pretty good prime minister... until he could not keep the plate spinning any more"". He also praised Rishi Sunak for his stabilising presence after the ""brief but damaging period of the Liz Truss premiership"" and said he also always respected Baroness May's ""dedication to public service"". He said he disagreed with Boris Johnson's handling of the pandemic, which involved restrictions that were ""too tight"" and saw the government treat people in a way that showed they ""weren't trusted enough to make their own judgements"". However, he said the pandemic had been""a hellishly difficult time to be prime minister"" and required Mr Johnson to make some ""very, very difficult judgements"". He added that he respected anyone who took on the role of prime minister, particularly ""through those years of turmoil and exceptional circumstances, the pressures were immense"". Lord Brady, who chose not to stand in the last general election, said he had left front-line politics because he was, at 57, ""still young enough to pursue other opportunities"". He said the first was publishing his memoir, which was ""largely a diary, based on my diaries"". ""There's no point in over-editing that, so there are things that I say that are what I thought at the time, and some of them are fairly trenchant views,"" he added. ""They may possibly be... views that would have developed over time and changed into slightly different judgements, but I didn't think there was any point in making things up or holding too much back. ""I haven't said everything I could have said but I've been going through the notes in the diaries that I kept I've tried to make sure that things that were important and things that people will base their judgements on are there.""

""The situation in Sudan is very alarming... the massive displacement - it's now the largest in the world, and, of course, famine,"" director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. He said 12 million people were already displaced, adding that attention in the global community to Sudan was ""really low"" and race was a factor. Thousands of people have been killed since a civil war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). ""Imagine: destruction, displacement, diseases everywhere, and now famine,"" Dr Tedros told the BBC. He said he had recently visited a camp for the internally displaced people and a hospital in Sudan. ""You see there many children skin and bone, emaciated."" Close to 25 million people - half of Sudan's population - ""need support"", Dr Tedros said. He stressed that Sudan ""is not getting the attention it deserves"", and that was the case with other recent conflicts in Africa. ""I think race is in the play here. That's what I feel now. We see the pattern now."" Dr Tedros - who grew up during war in Ethiopia - said: “Especially in Africa, I think the attention is really, really low.” “That’s the sad part, because you see it repeatedly, not just in Sudan,” he added. “I know the smell of war, the image of war, the sound of war,"" the WHO chief said.  ""From that, I can understand how it impacts others, and I remember my mother praying I survive a day at a time - growing up, survival of the day was a big thing, I see the same thing is Sudan and Gaza."" Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Dr Tedros said the world did not give “equal attention to black and white lives"". At the time, he elaborated by saying only a fraction of the aid given to Ukraine was given to other humanitarian crises, with Tigray in Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Syria not receiving the same treatment. Dr Tedros urged mainstream media to give more attention to Sudan, describing the situation there as a ""tragedy"". In August, a UN-backed committee of experts declared a famine at a camp housing about 500,000 displaced people near the besieged city of el-Fasher in Darfur, one of the regions worst affected by the conflict. The leader of Sudan's army, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the head of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, had jointly staged a coup in 2021, but then fell out eventually plunging Sudan into a civil war last year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is accused of supporting the RSF with money and guns - which it denies - while Saudi Arabia is said to have close ties with the Sudanese government. Various mediation efforts, brokered by Saudi Arabia and the US, have failed to end the conflict."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvdyd4nnzro,No new pledge on Ukraine missiles after Starmer-Biden talks,Ukraine has repeatedly urged the UK and US to let it fire long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:50.117606,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has held ""productive"" talks with US President Joe Biden about Ukraine – but he did not signal any decision on allowing Kyiv to fire long-range missiles into Russia. Sir Keir said the talks in Washington concentrated on ""strategy"", rather than a ""particular step or tactic"". The White House said the pair had also expressed ""deep concern about Iran and North Korea's provision of lethal weapons to Russia"". Early on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had launched over 70 Iranian-made drones across Ukraine overnight, and that his country needed more air defence and long-range capabilities ""to protect life and our people"". ""We are working on this with all Ukrainian partners,"" he said. Ahead of the talks at the White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Western nations not to let Ukraine fire long-range missiles at Russia. Putin said such a move would represent Nato's ""direct participation"" in the Ukraine war.  But former UK defence secretary Sir Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Nato should let Ukraine fire long-range missiles in Russia in spite of Putin's threats, adding that wrangling was just benefiting the Russian president. ""I'm just disappointed that it's yet again another tug of war around another capability,"" the former Conservative MP said. Kurt Volker, former US special representative for Ukraine negotiations said Putin's comments were made to prevent further Western action. ""The reason Putin says those things is to achieve the result of deterring us from doing things - not that it has any bearing on what he's really going to do or really thinks,"" he told the Today programme. Commenting on the debate over long-range missiles, he said the US ""overplays the sense that this is a new red line that this would be so provocative to Russia that it would create some kind of new escalation"". Addressing reporters ahead of his meeting with Sir Keir at the White House, Biden said: ""I don't think much about Vladimir Putin.""  To date, the US and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia, for fear of escalation. However, Zelensky has repeatedly called on Kyiv's Western allies to authorise such use, saying it is the only way to bring about an end to the war. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under daily bombardment from Russia.  Many of the missiles and glide bombs that hit Ukraine's military positions, blocks of flats, energy facilities and hospitals are launched by Russian aircraft deep inside Russia. Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself. The UK previously said Ukraine had a ""clear right"" to use British-provided weapons for ""self-defence"" which ""does not preclude operations inside Russia"", following Kyiv's surprise cross-border incursion last month. However, this excludes the use of long-range Storm Shadow missiles in territory outside Ukraine's internationally recognised borders. The US provided long-range missiles to Ukraine earlier this year, but like Kyiv's other Western allies these have not been authorised for use on targets deep inside Russia. Asked if he was intimidated by Putin's threats of a potential war with Nato, Sir Keir said ""the quickest way to resolve"" the war in Ukraine ""lies through what Putin actually does"". Sir Keir said the White House meeting with Biden was an opportunity to discuss the strategy in relation to Ukraine, ""not just a particular step or tactic"".  The pair also discussed the situation in the Middle East, where the Israel-Gaza war has been raging for nearly a year, and ""other areas across the world"", Sir Keir added. He told reporters they would get another opportunity to discuss these issues at the United Nations General Assembly next week.  In a separate briefing on Friday, ahead of the two leaders' meeting, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington was not planning any change in the limits it has placed on Ukraine's use of US-made weapons to hit Russian territory. Earlier on Friday, Moscow expelled six British diplomats, revoking their accreditation and accusing them of spying.  The country's security service, the FSB, said in a statement it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia. The accusations were dismissed by the UK Foreign Office as ""completely baseless"". In an interview with the BBC, UK defence analyst Justin Crump said Putin was testing the new Labour government and the outgoing Biden administration.  ""Ultimately Russia already supplies weapons to the UK's adversaries, and is already engaged in 'active measures' such as subversion, espionage, sabotage, and information/cyber operations against Nato members' interests. ""This may all accelerate, but picking a fight against all of Nato is not something Russia can afford given how hard they're struggling against just Ukraine,"" Mr Crump added.  Also on Friday, the US announced new sanctions against the Russian media channel RT, accusing it of being a ""de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus"". The top US diplomat, Antony Blinken, told reporters RT is part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets, which have sought to covertly ""undermine democracy in the United States"". In response to US allegations that RT had sought to influence elections, the broadcaster's editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan - who was sanctioned by the US last week - said they were excellent teachers, adding that many RT staff had studied in the US, and with US funding. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said there should be a ""new profession"" in the US, of specialist in sanctions imposed on Russia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5d7j9900o,Russia and Ukraine exchange 206 prisoners,The Russian servicemen released include those captured during Ukraine's recent attack in Kursk.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:55.879081,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia and Ukraine have exchanged 206 prisoners of war in a deal brokered by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Russia's ministry of defence said its 103 released servicemen came from among those captured during the Kursk incursion.  Posting pictures of some of those released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""Our people are home"".  Last month, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack across the Russian border, advancing up to 30km (18 miles) into the Kursk region.  Zelensky said those Ukrainians released included 82 privates and sergeants and 21 officers from the armed forces, national guard, border guards, and police.  He said they had been captured defending the regions of Kyiv, Donetsk, Mariupol, Azovstal, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv. Russia said its released soldiers were in Belarus and would be given the ""necessary psychological and medical assistance"" and would be allowed to contact their relatives before being returned to Russia.  The UAE, which has remained broadly neutral in the conflict, has acted as a mediator for previous prisoner swaps. In August, following the Kursk incursion, an initial exchange was completed involving 230 prisoners in total.  Ukraine's incursion into Kursk was in part intended to draw troops away from Russia's operations in eastern Ukraine.  The latest swap comes as Russia said it had recaptured a village in eastern Ukraine, where it has made a number of advances over recent weeks.  On Saturday, the ministry of defence said its forces had taken the village of Zhelanne Pershe in the Pokrovsk district. It is less than 30km (19 miles) from the town of Pokrovsk, which is home to a key railway station and sits at the intersections of several important roads. The town plays a crucial role as a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the eastern region of Donbas, and has for months been a key target for Russian forces."

A Manchester City Council report said the restoration project, which was already over budget by £29m in February, has faced challenges including several claims from contractors. Members of the council's Executive are to be asked to approve the increase, which would be funded via long-term borrowing, when they meet on 16 October. Deputy Council Leader, Garry Bridges, said the increased costs were ""not where we wanted to be"" but stressed it was a ""once-in-a-century undertaking""  which was set to ""benefit the city for many decades to come"". Bridges said that ""failure to carry out essential work on the town hall, allowing it to slip into disrepair, decay and disuse, would have been more costly in the long-run without creating anything like the same positive legacy for the city"". ""This is a testing moment but what the Our Town Hall project will deliver for Manchester will stand the test of time,"" he added. But leader of the Liberal Democrat group, Councillor John Leech, said he was ""not surprised"" by the increased cost, saying it was ""symptomatic of the council nearly always overspending on capital projects"". The project to restore the Grade I listed Victorian building on Albert Square was due to be completed in July but delays have meant that this has been pushed back to July 2026.   The original budget for the project was £325m, while the current budget for the project, ahead of any further spending being given the green light later in October, is £353.8m. A report to councillors said the Our Town Hall project had faced ""significant challenges"", including structural issues and major external events such as the coronavirus pandemic, hyperinflation in the construction industry and the war in Ukraine. The £49m contingency funding included in the original budget in case of unforeseen events was not enough, a council spokesperson said. But the biggest cost faced by the council was said to have arisen from financial claims from contractors whose workers had been temporarily stood down or remained on site for longer than originally envisaged.  The council spokesperson said they were ""robustly negotiating more than 80 such claims to ensure a fair outcome"". The Our Town Hall update report will be considered by the council’s Resources and Governance Scrutiny Committee on 10 October and its executive on 16 October. A further progress update is to be made to the resources and governance scrutiny committee in spring 2025.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3w5449x9zo,Starmer-Biden talks were about second-guessing Putin,The war in Ukraine hung over talks between the UK prime minister and US president in Washington.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:56.196940,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"In the hours before the prime minister was taken by motorcade to the White House, he and his team were in a secure room at the nearby British Embassy. This is a room designed for conversations spies are not meant to hear, however sophisticated their techniques for eavesdropping and intercepting digital exchanges. The Downing Street team were talking to British government staff in Ukraine and Russia, assembling their briefing and approach for their forthcoming conversation with President Biden. They arrived at the White House in the late afternoon Washington time, the president showing Sir Keir Starmer around the Rose Garden before heading for the Blue Room. On each side of a long rectangular table, the two delegations, the prime minister and president with seven colleagues each alongside them. For just a few minutes, we reporters were invited in too. Warm words from the leaders followed by loud questions and prompt ejection for the journalists. What followed was about 90 minutes of conversation in private. Ukraine dominated, but not to the exclusion of other issues – not least the Middle East, China and Iran. Downing Street had sought in advance to portray this as an opportunity for a deeper conversation than the usual round of international summits often allow. But why bother when President Biden is soon to be yesterday’s man, out of office, power and influence in four months time? The urgency of the issues on the table, I am told. Take Ukraine: an ally of both the UK and the US, still in desperate need of ongoing help as its friends weigh up how best to provide it - and at what cost. The UK has been ""forward facing"" as it was put to me in making the case to others to agree to Kyiv’s request to be allowed to fire western missiles into Russia. President Biden is sceptical, fearful it could drag America and Europe into direct conflict with Moscow. That is just what Vladimir Putin has been hinting at in the last few days. Then again his sabre rattling in the past hasn’t come to much, so perhaps it wouldn’t again? But maybe, this time, it would. Diplomacy and intelligence turning to the psychology of a leader at war, attempting to second guess how he might react. Would he really contemplate a military attack on a Nato member state – with the frightening potential of hauling the whole western alliance into war with Russia? And, if not that, would Ukraine’s allies stomach lower level aggression in retaliation, such as cyber attacks or damaging sub-sea communication cables? There was little expectation this meeting would resolve the question about western missiles, not least because further conversations with others at the United Nations are expected shortly. Afterwards, the prime minister wouldn’t be drawn on whether he had persuaded the president to change his mind. This is a conflict without obvious end which presents too no end of thorny dilemmas based around a recurring theme: how to defeat Russia without provoking Moscow. What could be the consequences of action? And what could be the consequences of inaction? It is the essence of the West’s challenge since the full scale invasion of Ukraine two and a half years ago.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4xl7xx394o,Firm making drones for Ukraine plans more jobs,The company hopes to generate 200 jobs in the UK over the next three years across its two sites.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:56.490338,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A tech company that has built drones for surveillance and intelligence gathering in Ukraine plans to expand further after creating 30 jobs in mid Wales. Tekever said it hoped to generate 200 jobs in the UK over the next three years, across its two sites in Aberporth, Ceredigion, and Southampton. The company's AR3 drone, which can fly for up to 16 hours, is built and tested at Parc Aberporth near Cardigan. Earlier this year, the company's AR3 drone was featured in a Ministry of Defence announcement that £60m was being spent on new surveillance drones for the Ukrainian army.  The drone can operate over land and sea and fly at speeds of about 45mph. It can be launched from the ground by a catapult or by it can be fitted with rotors so it can launch vertically. It lands by using a parachute and protective airbag. For security reasons, Tekever would not comment on whether the drones being built at Aberporth were being used by the Ukrainian army. The AR3 is also used for tasks such as patrolling maritime areas and monitoring oil and gas pipelines. The firm did say that its drones were deployed in Ukraine for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The construction of the AR3, made largely from a carbon fibre body, takes precision engineering, as every component has to be a specific weight. Parc Aberporth was created in 2006 by the now abolished Welsh Development Agency as a test and evaluation centre for unmanned aerial vehicles. The area around Parc Aberporth is a restricted air space which means that drones can operate and fly without special permission. The British Army's controversial Watchkeeper drone, built by Thales, has been tested in the area. Matthew Biginton, of Tekever, said: ""We've mainly taken people from the local area. ""We've taken people from retail, pet food packing warehouses, local garages, all sorts of backgrounds, and given them highly skilled jobs. We've put a couple of our guys on degree courses.  ""We train internally and have a great network in Portugal of several hundred staff with lots of experience, so we send people out to train."" He described it as a ""very high-tech company"" which improved its employees' skills.  ""We get the best out of people here. In terms of the local community, having a company like this on the local doorstep brings footprint through travel, hotels."" Morgan Brandy-Phillips, from Aberaeron, who has been taken on as an apprentice by Tekever said: ""A year ago, I finished my A-levels.  ""My dad was laying kerbs in the car park back in June, and he asked if there were any jobs going. Now I'm here."" Morgan said he has had a range of experiences since joining the company. ""I've learnt a lot of electrical work I'm starting a course next week on electrical engineering. ""I've learnt 3D printing and even carbon fibre work. I think it's great that it's right at my doorstep."" Scott McClelland, a company deputy director, said: ""We're looking at how we expand and grow in the UK. The opportunity came to invest in west Wales.  ""We've got the segregated airspace that allows us to produce aircraft here and demonstrate them.  ""We've established this as a research and development facility, bringing in production capabilities. This is the first time we've done this outside of Portugal. ""Having the capability to customise our platforms and test them out on the airfield is a really important aspect for us."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgxgvw38xjo,"Russia can end war now, says PM as Putin warns West",Keir Starmer made the comments as he travelled to Washington for talks with US President Joe Biden.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:56.646249,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia started the conflict in Ukraine and can end it ""straight away”, Sir Keir Starmer has said. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Moscow would regard Western missiles being fired into Russia as a serious escalation of the war. Putin told Russian state television that this would “mean nothing other than the direct participation of Nato countries - the US and European countries - in the war in Ukraine.""  Sir Keir is in Washington for talks with US President Joe Biden on Friday, as allies of Kyiv discuss giving Ukraine permission to fire their missiles at targets inside Russia. ""It is their direct participation,"" he said. ""And, of course, this substantially changes the very essence, the nature of the conflict.” He added: “If that is the case, we will take corresponding decisions based on the threats that will be created to us.” Asked for his response to the remarks on his flight to Washington, the prime minister struck a robust tone repeatedly stating that Russia had started the war. “Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia can end this conflict straight away,” he said.  He later added: “To reiterate, it was Russia who started this in the first place. They caused the conflict, they’re the ones who are acting unlawfully.” The prime minister and Foreign Secretary David Lammy are on a blitz of international diplomacy, as Ukraine’s allies discuss how to respond to Iran stepping up its weapons support for Russia. Lammy told the BBC this “clearly changes the debate” as he visited Kyiv alongside the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. On Sunday, the day after the prime minister returns from Washington, he will fly to Rome to meet the Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Meloni. Italy currently holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group of industrialised countries. A week later world leaders will gather in New York for the annual UN General Assembly. There has long been a hesitancy to allow Ukraine to fire Western missiles into Russia because of fears it could be seen as provocative and draw the US, European countries and others directly into the conflict. But with winter approaching and Russia getting extra support from Iran, minds appear to be changing. When asked about the prospect of allowing the Anglo-French cruise missile called Storm Shadow to be used, the public remarks of senior figures remain guarded. “There are really important developments likely in the next few weeks and months, both in Ukraine and the Middle East, and therefore a number of tactical decisions ought to be taken,” the prime minister told reporters, without disputing the issue is on the agenda. He noted that both Blinken and Lammy had recently visited Ukraine. ""They're obviously with us to report into the process on a really important joint trip.” Speaking earlier in the day, Putin said: “This isn’t about allowing or banning the Kyiv regime from striking Russian territory. It does that already with drones and by other means.  ""But when we talk about high-precision, long-range weapons made in the West this is a completely different matter... The Ukrainian army is not able to strike with modern, high-precision, long-range systems. It can’t do this.  ""It is only possible with intelligence data from satellites that Ukraine doesn’t have, data that’s only from satellites of the European Union, the USA, Nato satellites."" ""The key point,"" he added, ""is that only servicemen of Nato countries can input flight missions into these missile systems. Ukrainian servicemen cannot do this. Therefore this is not about permitting or not permitting the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons.  ""This is about whether or not Nato countries take the decision to directly participate in the military conflict.” This is the prime minister’s second visit to Washington in a little over two months, having travelled here in July for the Nato Summit and a visit to the White House, shortly after winning the general election.  Sir Keir said he would not be meeting the vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris during the visit. When asked by journalists on the flight to the US, he said: “No, because she will be in other parts of the US as you'd expect, rather than Washington, she'll be as you'd expect in swing states...

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx90dy5qzzo,"Woman, 96, spared jail after causing deadly crash","June Mills ""could not explain"" why she sped forward and struck a fellow member of her bridge club.",30 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:56.804572,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A 96-year-old woman has been spared an immediate prison sentence for killing a fellow member of her bridge club when her car mounted a kerb. June Mills struck Brenda Joyce, 76, after applying too much acceleration to her Vauxhall Corsa in Formby, Merseyside, on 2 August 2023. Liverpool Crown Court heard Mills ""could not explain"" why she sped forward and struck Mrs Joyce and her friend Jennifer Ensor, 80, who suffered less-serious injuries.  Mills, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and she was banned from driving for five years. Judge Simon Medland, KC, said it ""would not profit anybody"" to put Mills in jail and called the case an ""utter tragedy"". Robert Dudley, prosecuting, said the three women were leaving a meeting of the bridge club at Formby Methodist Church on Elbow Lane at about 16:00 BST.  Mills, who had been driving for 65 years, had begun to drive away while the two women were walking side-by-side towards their own vehicles.  Mills' vehicle, which was found to be in good condition, lurched forward as she tried to manoeuvre around a parked car, knocking Mrs Ensor to the ground and throwing Mrs Joyce into the air. The court heard her head struck the windscreen and she was then trapped under the car until Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service were able to free her. Mrs Joyce suffered multiple traumatic injuries and died at the scene. Mr Dudley said Mrs Joyce's widower had not supported the prosecution and had not provided a statement. However Mrs Ensor said the memory would stay with her ""forever"" and she now felt nervous walking on pavements or travelling in the car. She said she had been unable to complete a round of golf since the incident and felt a ""sense of guilt"" at having survived. The court heard Mills was interviewed by Merseyside Police seven weeks later and provided a prepared statement which read: ""I remember pressing the accelerator just gently and then it felt as if it dropped to the floor and shot off. ""It all happened very quickly and there were people in front of me but I could not avoid hitting them because the car was going so fast I had no control over it."" Tim Gent, defending Mills, said his client was a ""compassionate, caring and principled lady who is now reluctant to leave her home"".  ""This is plainly a dreadfully sad case,"" he said. ""Mrs Mills, the defendant, is extremely sorry for what happened.  ""The consequences will haunt her forever. She feels great shame and guilt."" He told the court that she was a retired careers advisor and in later years had volunteered with victims of crime and with young offenders.  Mills and her husband were also housing refugees from the war in Ukraine, he said.  Judge Medland, passing sentence, told the court it would be ""unjust"" to send Mills to prison. She was also ordered to pay a £1,500 fine and £500 in prosecution costs.  Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

A Foreign Office spokesperson accused Russia of making ""malicious and completely baseless accusations"" against its staff, after Moscow claimed the diplomats were engaged in spying. A statement accused Russia of carrying out a ""malicious and deliberate public campaign of aggression against the UK"". Russia revoked the accreditation of the diplomats on 13 September, with the country's secret service, the FSB, saying it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia. In a statement, the Foreign Office spokesperson said the Kremlin was acting against an international treaty governing diplomatic relations. Russia was carrying out a ""deliberate campaign"" aimed at undermining and threatening the UK's security, as well as deterring its support for Ukraine, the spokesperson added. The Foreign Office said this campaign was being carried out through ""disinformation, acts of sabotage in Europe and direct harassment and restrictions against our diplomatic missions in Russia"". ""This campaign will not succeed. Russia must stop this activity immediately,"" the statement added.  A news crew stationed outside the Foreign Office building in London were told by police on Wednesday afternoon the ambassador, Andrei Kelin, had been and left a few hours earlier. Diplomatic accreditation is given by the host nation to recognise a person’s diplomatic status, as set out by the UN. Without it, a person does not have official diplomatic status. While the BBC understands the diplomats involved left Russia many weeks before being officially expelled, Moscow's announcement coincided with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Washington, where he met US President Joe Biden. They were due to discuss whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western long-range missiles at targets inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested ahead of this trip that Moscow would regard this as a serious escalation in the war, which equates to the ""direct participation"" of Nato countries. The diplomats involved, who were were named and pictured on Russian state TV, were the latest in a serious of similar expulsions - which have become increasingly common since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Earlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attaché was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an ""undeclared military intelligence officer""."

Vladimir Kara-Murza told the BBC he initially thought he was being ""led out to be executed"" when prison officers came in the night to fetch him from Siberia last month. It was only after being moved to Moscow that the dual British-Russian citizen realised he was one of 24 prisoners to be freed in the exchange - including a Kremlin hit man. But in his first joint interview with his wife Evgenia in Europe since they reunited, he defiantly reveals on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that he plans to return to Russia. “When our plane was taking off from Vnukovo airport in Moscow en route to Ankara on 1 August, the FSB [Russian Federal Security Service] officer who was my personal escort sitting next to me turned to me and said, 'Look out the window, this is the last time you're seeing your motherland',"" he told me. ""And I just laughed in his face, and I said, 'Look, man, I am a historian, I don’t just think, I don’t just believe, I know that I’ll be back home in Russia, and it’s going to happen much sooner than you can imagine'.” Mr Kara-Murza, one of the Kremlin’s most vocal critics, was held in solitary confinement in a high security jail after receiving a 25-year sentence in April 2023 on charges of high treason. Recalling the days before the huge Russia-West prisoner swap, he said: “I was asleep and suddenly the doors to my prison cell burst open and a group of prison officers barged in. ""I was woken up, I saw that it was dark, I asked what time it was, they said 3am. And they told me to get up and get ready in ten minutes. ""And at that moment, I was absolutely certain that I was being led out to be executed. ""But instead of the nearby wood, they took me to the airport, handcuffed with a prison convoy, boarded me on a plane and flew me to Moscow.” Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan were also released by Russia in the exchange. In the West, Russian security service hitman Vadim Krasikov was freed by Germany along with others elsewhere accused of intelligence activities. The US, Norway, Poland and Slovenia also participated in what was the biggest swap since the Cold War between the West and Russia ended more than 30 years ago. On Friday, Mr Kara-Murza met prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy - and he is now urging Western governments to give stronger backing to Ukraine. He is pushing for the release of thousands of other political prisoners who are still being held in Putin’s jails. In their interview, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday at 9am, he and his wife talk about their reunion, their family and the moment they tasted freedom. Mrs Kara Murza talks of her “immense joy” at having her husband back and seeing him with their three children. ""Having survived two assassination attempts and now this prison sentence, including eleven months in solitary confinement in horrendous conditions, he’s yet again alive and relatively healthy with us,"" she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlr87e5elo,Putin draws new red line on long-range missiles,"Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine using the West's long-range missiles would mean Nato countries ""fighting with Russia"".",13 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:26:57.335176,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The headline in this morning’s Kommersant newspaper captured the drama. “Vladimir Putin draws his red line.” Will the West cross it? And, if it does, how will Russia respond? Speaking in St Petersburg, President Putin sent a clear warning to the West: don’t allow Ukraine to use your long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Moscow, he said, would view that as the “direct participation” of Nato countries in the war in Ukraine. “It would substantially change the very essence, the nature of the conflict,” the Kremlin leader continued.  “This will mean that Nato countries, the USA and European states, are fighting with Russia.” He claimed that, for missile launches into Russia, Ukraine would require data from Western satellites and that only servicemen from Nato member states would be able to “input flight missions into these missile systems”. Russia has drawn red lines before. And seen them crossed before. On 24 February 2022, when he announced the start of his ""special military operation"" – the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – President Putin issued a warning to “those who may be tempted to interfere from the outside”. “No matter who tries to stand in our way or create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately,” the Kremlin leader had declared. “And the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.” Western leaders ignored what was widely interpreted at the time as nuclear sabre-rattling. The West has since provided Ukraine with tanks, advanced missile systems and, most recently, F-16 American fighter jets. This year Russia has already accused Ukraine of using American long-range ATACMS missiles to target Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia. What’s more, over the last two years, Russian officials and the state media here have on many occasions accused the West of “fighting Russia” or launching “a war” on Russia. Even though it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. But from the tone of President Putin’s latest remarks, it’s clear he considers that the targeting of internationally recognised Russian territory with Western missile systems would take the conflict to a new level. What he didn’t make clear yesterday is how Moscow would respond. “We will take corresponding decisions based on the threats to us that will be created,” Vladimir Putin said. On Friday, Russia withdrew the accreditation of six British diplomats, accusing them of “subversive activities” and threatening Russia’s security.  But Putin’s potential response is much broader. He offered some clues back in June. At a meeting with the heads of international news agencies, he was asked: how would Russia react if Ukraine was given the opportunity to hit targets on Russian territory with weapons supplied by Europe? “First, we will, of course, improve our air defence systems. We will be destroying their missiles,” President Putin replied. “Second, we believe that if someone is thinking it is possible to supply such weapons to a war zone to strike our territory and create problems for us, why can’t we supply our weapons of the same class to those regions around the world where they will target sensitive facilities of the countries that are doing this to Russia?” In other words, arming Western adversaries to strike Western targets abroad is something that Moscow has been considering. Earlier this month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, announced that Russia was set to revise its nuclear doctrine: the document that lays out under what circumstances Moscow may consider using nuclear weapons. He suggested that the decision to revise the doctrine was “connected with the escalation course of [Russia’s] Western adversaries”. Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer is in Washington for talks with President Biden. Among the issues the two leaders are expected to discuss is the question of Ukraine and long-range missiles. “Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine,” Sir Keir said on his way to Washington. “Russia can end this conflict straight away.” Western leaders will need to decide which they consider greater: the risk of escalation of this conflict, or the need to lift restrictions on Ukraine’s use of western missiles."

Recalling the days before the huge Russia-West prisoner swap, he said: “I was asleep and suddenly the doors to my prison cell burst open and a group of prison officers barged in. ""I was woken up, I saw that it was dark, I asked what time it was, they said 3am. And they told me to get up and get ready in ten minutes. ""And at that moment, I was absolutely certain that I was being led out to be executed. ""But instead of the nearby wood, they took me to the airport, handcuffed with a prison convoy, boarded me on a plane and flew me to Moscow.” Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan were also released by Russia in the exchange. In the West, Russian security service hitman Vadim Krasikov was freed by Germany along with others elsewhere accused of intelligence activities. The US, Norway, Poland and Slovenia also participated in what was the biggest swap since the Cold War between the West and Russia ended more than 30 years ago. On Friday, Mr Kara-Murza met prime minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy - and he is now urging Western governments to give stronger backing to Ukraine. He is pushing for the release of thousands of other political prisoners who are still being held in Putin’s jails. In their interview, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday at 9am, he and his wife talk about their reunion, their family and the moment they tasted freedom. Mrs Kara Murza talks of her “immense joy” at having her husband back and seeing him with their three children. ""Having survived two assassination attempts and now this prison sentence, including eleven months in solitary confinement in horrendous conditions, he’s yet again alive and relatively healthy with us,"" she said. Watch the full interview on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on BBC One and iPlayer at 9am."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2894q91ngo,Russia squares up to Ukraine in battle for control of chess,A vote at Fide general assembly in Hungary could fully reinstate Russia in international competition.,12 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:03.809534,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine has now spilled over on to the world of chess. Following Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the International Chess Federation (Fide) voted to ban the Russian national team and officials from competitions.  For a country with a history of dominance in chess, it was a bitter blow. But now, the Kremlin is fighting back.  A vote at next week's Fide general assembly in Budapest could fully reinstate Russia in international chess competitions. The Ukrainians, supported by allies from England, Germany and other nations, are trying to stop them. “Russia’s control of Fide is absolute,” says Malcolm Pein from the English Chess Federation.  Fide's president is a former Russian deputy prime minister, Arkady Dvorkovich, and Mr Pein speaks of Moscow staging a slow takeover of the federation, by making changes to its constitution, affecting the way decisions are made. “We have a sort of a manifestation of what used to be known in Soviet days as a ‘power vertical,’” he explains. “Any vote that Russia wants passed always gets passed.” Fide is affiliated to the International Olympic Committee and Malcolm Pein wants the IOC to exert pressure on the federation to maintain sanctions against Russia. The motion to lift all sanctions against Russia has been tabled by the Chess Federation of Kyrgyzstan, a key Russian ally in Central Asia. However, other countries are expected to support Moscow at the Fide congress too. German Chess Federation head Ingrid Lauterbach says every federation has one vote and that many states in Africa and Asia are ""easy to be influenced to vote in [Russia’s] favour"". ""You can see [pro-Russians] are trying to take over. It’s really worrying."" In a separate move, a Fide commission applied sanctions to the Russian Chess Federation (CFR) last June, excluding it for two years for “bringing chess into disrepute"" and violating the international organisation's principles. It found that the Russian federation had organised tournaments in areas of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian forces and reprimanded Fide's Russian president for his membership of the CFR board.  Ex-defence minister Sergei Shoigu and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who are both under international sanctions, are also board members. Arkady Dvorkovich said at the time that many of his colleagues on the Fide council disagreed with the ban on the federation and it would be appealed. ""Of course, the assembly cannot fail to consider such a significant issue for the entire world chess movement,"" he told Match TV. But next week’s crucial vote at the Fide General Assembly concerns separate sanctions applied in 2022 – namely, the exclusion of the Russian national chess team, flag, anthem and officials from all international chess events. Ukraine's bid to stop Russia taking control of the global chess body goes right to the top. President Volodymyr Zelensky has given the task to his adviser on strategic affairs, Alexander Kamyshin, who made his name at the start of the war for keeping Ukraine's railways on track despite repeated attack.  “I was quite surprised with this vote in Budapest,” says Mr Kamyshin, who is the new head of the Ukrainian Chess Federation.  “We’ve had 21 chess players killed in this war. It’s not fair to raise this issue in the agenda while Russia is killing our civilians, our chess players in Ukraine.” The Russian Chess Federation and Arkady Dvorkovich have declined to comment to the BBC, although Russian officials have called the decision to sanction the RCF “deliberately political and unsportsmanlike”. Malcolm Pein fears that if Russia is let back into the chess fold, it would be a ""huge propaganda coup"". “They'll be able to point to it and say, look, we've been allowed back into chess. They could demonstrate to their citizens they don't have to suffer as many privations as they should be suffering because of the war."" For Ukraine and its Western allies, chess is just one element of their campaign to maintain sanctions pressure on Russia across the board. But after two and half years of war, the calls for Moscow to be welcomed back into the international community are growing louder."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rwkk9r51jo,What are Storm Shadow missiles and why are they crucial for Ukraine?,Western states have long been cautious about allowing Ukraine to use their missiles against Russia.,14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:03.986469,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"There have been strong indications that the US and UK are poised to lift their restrictions within days on Ukraine using long-range missiles against targets inside Russia. But no confirmation came from talks between US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in Washington on Friday. Ukraine already has supplies of these missiles, but is restricted to firing them at targets inside its own borders. Kyiv has been pleading for weeks for these restrictions to be lifted so it can fire on targets inside Russia.  So why the reluctance by the West and what difference could these missiles make to the war? Storm Shadow is an Anglo-French cruise missile with a maximum range of around 250km (155 miles). The French call it Scalp.  Britain and France have already sent these missiles to Ukraine - but with the caveat that Kyiv can only fire them at targets inside its own borders. It is launched from aircraft then flies at close to the speed of sound, hugging the terrain, before dropping down and detonating its high explosive warhead.  Storm Shadow is considered an ideal weapon for penetrating hardened bunkers and ammunition stores, such as those used by Russia in its war against Ukraine. But each missile costs nearly US$1 million (£767,000), so they tend to be launched as part of a carefully planned flurry of much cheaper drones, sent ahead to confuse and exhaust the enemy’s air defences, just as Russia does to Ukraine. They have been used with great effect, hitting Russia’s Black Sea naval headquarters at Sevastopol and making the whole of Crimea unsafe for the Russian navy. Justin Crump, a military analyst, former British Army officer and CEO of the Sibylline consultancy, says Storm Shadow has been a highly effective weapon for Ukraine, striking precisely against well protected targets in occupied territory.  ""It’s no surprise that Kyiv has lobbied for its use inside Russia, particularly to target airfields being used to mount the glide bomb attacks that have recently hindered Ukrainian front-line efforts,"" he says. Ukraine’s cities and front lines are under daily bombardment from Russia.  Many of the missiles and glide bombs that wreak devastation on military positions, blocks of flats and hospitals are launched by Russian aircraft far within Russia itself. Kyiv complains that not being allowed to hit the bases these attacks are launched from is akin to making it fight this war with one arm tied behind its back.  At the Globsec security forum I attended in Prague this month, it was even suggested that Russian military airbases were better protected than Ukrainian civilians getting hit because of the restrictions. Ukraine does have its own, innovative and effective long-range drone programme.  At times, these drone strikes have caught the Russians off guard and reached hundreds of kilometres inside Russia.  But they can only carry a small payload and most get detected and intercepted.  Kyiv argues that in order to push back the Russian air strikes, it needs long-range missiles, including Storm Shadow and comparable systems including American ATACMs, which have an even greater range of 300km. Some, but it may be a case of too little too late. Kyiv has been asking to use long-range Western missiles inside Russia for so long now that Moscow has already taken precautions for the eventuality of the restrictions being lifted.  It has moved bombers, missiles and some of the infrastructure that maintains them further back, away from the border with Ukraine and beyond the range of Storm Shadow. The Institute for the Study of War think tank (ISW) has identified around 200 Russian bases that would be in range of Storm Shadows fired from Ukraine. Some further additional bases would come into range if the US approves the use of ATACMS missiles in Russia. But one ex-US official told the BBC that there was scepticism in the White House and the Pentagon about how much difference using Storm Shadow missiles inside Russia would make to Ukraine's war effort. Justin Crump of Sibylline says while Russian air defence has evolved to counter the threat of Storm Shadow within Ukraine, this task will be much harder given the scope of Moscow’s territory that could now be exposed to attack.  ""This will make military logistics, command and control, and air support harder to deliver, and even if Russian aircraft pull back further from Ukraine’s frontiers to avoid the missile threat they will still suffer an increase in the time and costs per sortie to the front line."" Matthew Savill, director of military science at Rusi think tank, believes lifting restrictions would offer two main benefits to Ukraine.  Firstly, it might ""unlock"" another system, the ATACMs.  Secondly, it would pose a dilemma for Russia as to where to position those precious air defences, something he says could make it easier for Ukraine’s drones to get through. Ultimately though, says Savill, Storm Shadow is unlikely to turn the tide. Ukraine doesn't have many missiles, and the UK has very few left to give.  And it has been widely reported that, in anticipation of this permission being given, Moscow has already moved the bulk of its air assets and ammunition deeper into Russia, beyond the range of Ukraine’s missiles. In a word: escalation.  Washington worries that although so far all of President Vladimir Putin’s threatened red lines have turned out to be empty bluffs, allowing Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles could just push him over the edge into retaliating.  The fear in the White House is that hardliners in the Kremlin could insist this retaliation takes the form of attacking transit points for missiles on their way to Ukraine, such as an airbase in Poland. If that were to happen, Nato's Article 5 could be invoked, meaning the alliance would be at war with Russia.  Ever since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the White House's aim has been to give Kyiv as much support as possible without getting dragged into direct conflict with Moscow, something that would risk being a precursor to the unthinkable: a catastrophic nuclear exchange. Nonetheless, it has allowed Ukraine to use Western supplied missiles against targets in Crimea and the four partially occupied regions that Russia illegally annexed in 2022. While Moscow considers these regions part of its territory, the claims are not recognised by the US or internationally. One reason President Putin views the use of Storm Shadow as a direct intervention in the war by the US and UK is his belief that Ukrainian troops cannot use long-range missile systems without the aid of Western specialists.  He told reporters in Russia that ""only servicemen of Nato countries can input flight missions into these missile systems,"" adding that Kyiv also relies on satellite intelligence supplied by the West to choose targets.  Manufacturer MBDA declined to comment on the claims when approached by the BBC, directing queries to the UK Ministry of Defence.  A spokesperson for Ukraine's presidential office also declined to address Putin's allegations, saying they could not comment on ""special technical details regarding weapons"".  Justin Crump cast doubt on Putin's claim, telling the BBC that if ""that claim were true, then Russia would have made it more clearly when the weapons were first supplied, and when they conducted successful and impactful operations against for example the Black Sea Fleet HQ in occupied Crimea"".  ""The missile is available for export sales; is Russia seriously saying that any buyer would have to have a Nato/UK team to program and use the missile? That must presumably be buried deep in the fine print of the brochure, and wouldn't make it an appealing prospect,"" he noted. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lw1z0lej8o,Acne and asthma sufferers to be cleared to join army,"Defence Secretary John Healey says he wants to scrap ""outdated"" rules to tackle a recruitment crisis.",23 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:04.140631,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"People with asthma or severe acne will no longer be banned from joining Britain’s armed forces, Defence Secretary John Healey has said. Healey said he wanted to scrap ""outdated policies"" that block people from joining the army to end a recruitment crisis. In a speech to Labour’s annual conference, he also announced plans to get computer gamers to join a new cyber defence effort. “If you are a top gamer - your country needs you,” Healey told Labour activists in Liverpool.  Labour claims the British Army is at its smallest size in 200 years. It says a 6% pay increase announced in July will boost recruitment - but it also wants to speed up the process and scrap ""outdated"" restrictions. Anyone wanting to join the army has to pass a tough medical. People with heart problems, back problems, hearing or vision problems, among other things, will struggle to make the grade. But a range of other conditions can also affect candidates’ chances of being accepted. “Candidates with acne that may affect the ability to wear military clothing or to operate military equipment should normally be graded UNFIT, or entry should be deferred until the disease has been successfully treated,” says a Ministry of Defence briefing note from 2019. In its latest medical rules, the army says: ""Generally speaking, if you require treatment for asthma you will not be eligible. If you have had treatment in the past, then it will depend how long ago that was, how old you were at the time, what your symptoms were, and how much and how long you needed treatment for."" The rules on asthma - and all medical conditions - are regularly updated and are often considered on a case-by-case basis during the appeals process, it adds. Over the past five years, “medical reasons” have become the main reason for rejection in the British Army, with a total of 76,187 applicants disqualified on these grounds. Healey is also keen to recruit gamers to the army's ranks, telling the Sun that hours spent playing Call of Duty could prove useful to a new cyber defence initiative. “We are short of drone pilots,” the defence secretary said.  “You can see the changing nature of warfare in Ukraine, where the combination of artillery and drones is responsible for the large majority of all the casualties. “The sort of skills that drone pilots have are many of the same skills as some of our best console warriors are okay [at] in civilian life.” According to the latest Ministry of Defence figures, there were 74,296 members of the regular Army – down from 79,330 in October 2019. The previous government relaxed restrictions on beards and facial hair in an effort to boost recruitment. In a speech to the Labour conference on Monday, Healey said Labour would ""always maintain the highest standards. ""We will create an Armed Forces that draws the very best of British talent. Better fit to fight. Better reflecting the country they defend."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glgex9przo,Three Red Cross staff killed in strike in eastern Ukraine,The aid agency condemned the attack on its workers saying its vehicles are clearly marked.,12 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:04.312761,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says three of its workers have been killed, and two others injured in a strike in eastern Ukraine. The ICRC did not identify who was behind the attack but called it ""unconscionable"" that ""shelling would hit an aid distribution site"". Earlier, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said those killed were Ukrainian and blamed Moscow for the shelling, calling it ""another Russian war crime"". The agency said its vehicles are clearly marked and operate regularly in the frontline region of Donetsk. ""I condemn attacks on Red Cross personnel in the strongest terms,"" said the agency's president Mirjana Spoljaric, adding that: ""Our hearts are broken today as we mourn the loss of our colleagues and care for the injured."" The ICRC said its team had been preparing to distribute wood and coal briquettes to homes in Viroliubivka village, north of Donetsk city, when it was hit. The distribution of the goods had not begun yet and no residents were affected by the explosion, the agency said. It did not confirm any details about the identities of those killed. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had reported shelling in Viroliubivka and said workers had been unloading supplies when the attack happened.  In a post on social media, Ukraine's leader blamed a Russian strike. Zelensky shared a photo of a white truck in flames branded with the Red Cross logo on its side. ""Today, the occupier attacked the vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian mission,"" he said. The Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets also commented online, urging the Red Cross to publicly attribute the attack to Russia. ""The shelling is already known about, but the ICRC... remain silent!"" he wrote.  In its statement, the ICRC had reiterated that it is a ""neutral, impartial and independent organisation with an exclusively humanitarian mandate"".  It deplored the ""sharp rise"" in the killings of humanitarians around the world in the past two years. The United Nations has also made similar warnings. Its humanitarian mission to Ukraine earlier this year said 50 workers had killed or injured in Ukraine in 2023, including 11 killed in the line of duty, reported AFP news agency."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3611zjjnd2o,"Who is suspect in Trump assassination attempt, Ryan Routh?",He appears to have mixed politics and a history of support for Ukraine - as well as a number of legal issues.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:04.479077,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The suspect in an apparent assassination attempt against Donald Trump is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who was rejected by the country's armed forces and failed to make much of a contribution to the war effort. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, who appeared in court on Monday, is from North Carolina and spent most of his life there, but most recently lived in Hawaii. He voted for Trump in 2016 but later turned against him, and made statements of support and contributions to other politicians.  Here are some of the other things we know about him.  He is suspected of going to the Trump International Golf Course in Florida on Sunday, armed with an SKS-style rifle. The FBI recovered the weapon and scope, two backpacks and a GoPro camera from an area heavy with bush cover. Law enforcement allege that Routh fled the area when a Secret Service agent fired in his direction after spotting a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes.  He is not believed to have fired his own weapon during the incident, and is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point.  Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said two officers spotted Routh's vehicle, a black Nissan, and followed it for 45 minutes. Routh was stopped on Interstate 95, a major highway, and arrested. He has been initially charged with federal firearms offences. The affidavit states that Routh's phone was in the ""vicinity"" of the covered area for 12 hours. The car, a Nissan SUV, was later determined to have number plates which belonged to a 2012 Ford which had been reported as stolen.  BBC Verify found a number of social media profiles matching Routh's name. Routh repeatedly touted his work in encouraging foreign fighters to go to Ukraine to battle against Russia. However, most of his organising appears to have happened while he was in the US, not in Ukraine, where in 2022 he was rejected by the country's International Legion due to his lack of combat experience. The FBI is still investigating his links to Ukraine and has sent out multiple requests to companies for returns on his phone and social media accounts.  There are also pro-Palestinian, pro-Taiwan and anti-China messages on his profile, including allegations about Chinese ""biological warfare"" and references to the Covid-19 virus as an ""attack"". On an X post from 2020, Routh suggested he voted for Trump in 2016 but became disillusioned, writing: ""I will be glad when you [are] gone."" Routh also posted online urging President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris to meet victims of the attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. Routh was registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina, but appears to have voted in the most recent Democratic primary in March, according to state records. In 2019 and 2020, he gave a number of small donations totalling around $140 (£106) to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising organisation, according to online federal elections records. An Associated Press photo of a truck outside Routh's Hawaii home displayed a Biden-Harris campaign sticker on the back. In the past Routh also backed candidates such as Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who has since left the party and swung behind Trump, and also declared his support for former Republican presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. Routh described himself as a ""volunteer co-ordinator"" and his ambitions to join combat were not realised. The International Legion told the BBC that Routh had ""never been part of, associated with, or linked"" with the legion ... in any capacity"". A volunteer for the legion described Routh to the BBC as a chaotic presence who kept trying to ""sneak around"" officials and was ""doing more harm than good"".  The volunteer said that Routh was in Ukraine in April 2022. ""He was not part of any unit and his activities were essentially causing chaos,"" the volunteer said. ""He was also trying to pose as some sort of official entity for all volunteers, which, again, he was not,"" she said. Routh told The New York Times in 2023 that he wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban. One Facebook post from July of this year read: ""Soldiers, please do not call me. We are still trying to get Ukraine to accept Afghan soldiers and hope to have some answers in the coming months... please have patience."" In a book self-published in February 2023, Routh grumbled about how his efforts were received in Ukraine. ""I have yet to see... the smallest amount of appreciation or respect,"" he wrote. In the book, Routh said he spent five months in Ukraine and worked on various projects including a drone-building programme. He claims his efforts ended in failure or were shut down by the authorities. The book also contains a passage where he encourages Iranian officials, that they were ""free to assassinate Trump"". A conspiracy theory that claims Routh appeared in a promotional video for the investment company BlackRock - which manages $10 trillion in assets - has gone viral. One post that has more than three million views mentions the man who tried to kill Donald Trump at a rally in July and claims: “Ryan Routh also appeared in a Blackrock Commercial just like Thomas Crooks. That means both featured in Global Wealth management firm’s Commercial. These aren’t coincidences.” Crooks did appear briefly in BlackRock promotional video that profiled one of his teachers, but there is no evidence that Routh did. ""This is completely false,"" a BlackRock spokesperson said of the claim. ""Ryan Routh has never been an employee of BlackRock nor has he appeared in any BlackRock ads. The video circulating on social media has been manipulated to falsely link Routh to BlackRock."" The post featured a short video clip containing Routh, and claims it is from a Blackrock commercial. BBC Verify searched key frames from the video for previous versions online and confirmed that it comes from a political rally in Kyiv which was posted in May 2022. Visible in the video are several banners of the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian military unit. Routh supported Ukraine’s fight against Russia and was known to have visited the country in recent years. Records show Routh’s legal issues go back to the 1990s, including a variety of felonies and misdemeanours, including numerous charges for stolen goods. He was charged and convicted of numerous felony offences in Guilford County in North Carolina between 2002 and 2010, according to online records. In 2002, he was charged for possession of a fully automatic machine gun, which was referred to in court filings as a ""weapon of mass destruction"".  A local newspaper report from the time noted that he barricaded himself in a business and had a three-hour stand-off with police officers in the town of Greensboro before being taken into custody.  In another incident, records show him being charged with misdemeanours including a hit-and-run, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation. His alleged offences also include driving with a revoked licence and possession of stolen property. In 2019, the FBI also received a tip that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm. The unverified tip was passed on to local law enforcement in Honolulu. Former neighbour Kim Mungo describes Routh as a ""sweetheart"" and said federal agents once raided Routh's property. She alleged that he used to keep ""loads of stolen property and stuff"" at his home, and said she saw Routh and his family firing guns in the open. Routh's eldest son, Oran, described his father as ""a loving and caring father, and honest hardworking man"". He told CNN: ""I don't know what's happened in Florida, and I hope things have just been blown out of proportion, because from the little I've heard it doesn’t sound like the man I know to do anything crazy, much less violent."" Friends and family members are being sought for interviews by the FBI, including in North Carolina and Hawaii.  Routh appeared in front of a judge on Monday at the Palm Beach County court near Mar-a-Lago, charged with firearms offences.  The charges against him did not include any references to trying to kill Trump, though the FBI has said it is investigating Sunday's incident as an assassination attempt. Law enforcement stated after the court appearance that the suspect did not fire a weapon and did not have a line of sight on Trump. Secret Service and Homeland Security agents have searched Routh's former home in Greensboro, North Carolina. A hearing is scheduled for next Monday to determine whether he should remain in custody.  Prosecutors say he is a flight risk and a danger to the community."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ejk4p3jxjo,Russia's targeting of 'enemies within' evokes ghosts of the Soviet past,More Russians have been reporting each other since Ukraine invasion - what are the implications?,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:04.654684,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"I’m sitting in a courtroom in the town of Pushkin, 400 miles north-west of Moscow. Opposite me is the “aquarium” - the glass and metal box where the defendant is locked, the courtroom cage that makes anyone on trial in Russia look like a dangerous criminal. Behind the glass is Anna Alexandrova. The 46-year-old hairdresser has been charged with “the public dissemination of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”. Put simply, spreading fake news about the Russian army. The charge relates to messages and social media posts she has been accused of sending. The key prosecution witness is here, too - Anna’s neighbour. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine there have been regular reports of Russians reporting neighbours, colleagues and acquaintances to the police over alleged anti-war statements. Denunciations have led to arrests, prosecutions and, in some cases, long prison sentences. But why has snitching become commonplace? And what are the implications for Russian society? To find out, I have spoken to a number of Russians caught up in this, including a doctor informed on by her patient and an 87-year-old man who was forced off a bus and dragged to the police.  Listen to Steve Rosenberg on The Global Story podcast: The Russians snitching on each other for anti-war views Back at the court in Pushkin, Anna Alexandrova’s neighbour, Irina Sergeyeva, is sitting two rows in front of me with her mother Natalya. They live in the house next to Anna’s.  The two families were once on good terms but have fallen out. Badly. During a break in proceedings, I ask Natalya why. “She started sending [my daughter] pictures from the special military operation [Russia’s war in Ukraine],” claims Natalya. “Images of soldiers' bodies torn apart, and tanks on fire.” “I wrote to the prosecutor’s office about this,” Natalya adds. “The images make you want to cry.” Anna denies sending any of the images and messages in question. According to her lawyer, if convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison. However, as I would discover, there was more to the tale of Anna and Irina than met the eye. Free speech in Russia was already under attack, but days after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Vladimir Putin took it to a whole new level.  A few days after ordering Russian troops into Ukraine for what he called a “special military operation”, President Putin signed into law repressive legislation designed to silence or punish criticism. Russians could now be prosecuted for “discrediting the use of the Russian armed forces” and receive long prison sentences for spreading “knowingly false information” about the army. The authorities also signalled a hunt for internal enemies. President Putin declared: “…any nation, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like an insect in their mouth, spit them onto the pavement. I am convinced that a natural and necessary self-detoxification of society like this will strengthen our country, our solidarity and cohesion…” In this atmosphere of “us” against “them”, reports started coming in of Russians snitching on Russians for opposing the war in Ukraine - of students informing on teachers, professors on students, work colleagues on each other. Not all complaints have made it to court. But in some cases, Russia’s harsh new laws have been used to prosecute alleged offenders. This has revived memories of the Soviet past when denunciation was actively encouraged by the authorities. Under dictator Joseph Stalin, the prison camps, or Gulag, were full of victims who had been snitched on by their fellow citizens. “What I find remarkable is how quickly Russian genetic memory has come back, and how people who didn’t live in those times suddenly act as if they did,” says Nina Khrushcheva, a Russian-American professor of International Affairs at The New School in New York. “Suddenly they are squealing on others. It is a Soviet practice but it’s also something about the Russian genetic code, of fear, of trying to protect themselves at the expense of others.” But this is only half the story. The more I learn about the case of the hairdresser, Anna, the more I realise that denunciation isn’t solely a product of fear and self-preservation. Sometimes personal rivalries, or personal interest, are at play. “The so-called ‘political’ articles of the criminal code have become a very convenient way to resolve conflicts between neighbours,” suggests Anna’s lawyer Anastasia Pilipenko. “This particular case began with a run-of-the mill domestic squabble. One side went to the police but got nowhere. That only changed when the charge of ‘fake news about the army’ appeared.” In reality, the conflict between Anna and Irina began, not with social media messages, but a row over land.  The two families had originally battled together to protect a local forest from developers. Things changed when Irina tried to rent a plot. She said she needed it for grazing goats. “[Anna] harboured a grudge,” says Irina. “She called us fraudsters. She claimed we would buy the land and sell it on to developers. I told her that was nonsense. Then the floodgates opened.” What happened next, as recounted by Irina and her mother, is as surreal and dark as a novel by 19th Century Russian writer Nikolai Gogol.  It is a story of neighbours at daggers drawn. It features a row about a fence, allegations of poisoned cutlets, slashed car tyres and other “dirty tricks”.  There are claims and counterclaims, accusations of jealousy, insobriety, fake social media accounts. Plus, an argument over the sale of rabbits. Anna and Irina’s village, Korpikyulya, is remarkably quiet, considering. When I visit, I’m struck by the silence. There’s hardly a soul to be seen. But, as I stare across the fields, I have the strangest feeling, as if something is rising from the earth. I close my eyes. I recall a trip to Siberia, where climate change has been melting the permafrost, exposing skeletons, and releasing harmful bacteria and gases. Suddenly it hits me. Something similar is happening here and across Russia. Two-and-a-half years of war, of parallel reality and parallel morality, are releasing demons from the depths of the Russian soul and society. Russians even have a word for it, one they have borrowed from the Greeks - “khton”. It means something dark and evil, the monsters deep inside of us. And when the demons from below mix with what is happening above, like repressive laws and the search for internal enemies, that is when you get neighbour reporting on neighbour. But surely Russia has no monopoly on monsters. For all the talk of a nation’s genetic code, human traits have no borders. We should not kid ourselves that denunciation is only possible in Putin’s Russia. “I do not exclude lots of denunciations happening in Britain, if people there were to feel they could inform on opponents without any comeback and with the encouragement of the state,” says veteran human rights campaigner Oleg Orlov. “It’s human nature. Unfortunately, lots of people try to destroy individuals they don’t like in their personal or public lives, using any means possible.” Yet it was in Russia, not Britain, where Mr Orlov was denounced and prosecuted for an anti-war article he had published. Earlier this year he was convicted of “repeatedly discrediting” the Russian army and jailed for two-and-a-half years. He was then released early as part of a prisoner swap. He concedes that “the Russian state is creating the kind of society in which people, who are informers by nature, feel happy and comfortable.” Back at the courthouse in Pushkin, Anna’s trial is ongoing. With the hairdresser facing the prospect of years in prison, I ask Irina and Natalya whether they have any regrets. “I feel sorry for her,” Natalya says. “I could cry.” “Crimes committed must be punished,” says Irina. I’m at another trial, this time in Moscow. Locked in the cage is 68-year-old paediatrician Nadezhda Buyanova. She, too, has been accused of spreading “fake news” about the Russian army. “I’ve read about this kind of thing happening to others,” Nadezhda tells me through the glass. “I never imagined it would happen to me.” The mother of a patient claims the doctor told her that Russian soldiers in Ukraine were legitimate targets. The woman, whose ex-husband had been killed fighting in Ukraine, recorded an angry video and reported Nadezhda to the police. “Buyanova denies the accusations,” Nadezhda’s lawyer Oskar Cherdzhiev tells me. “It’s an unusual case because, essentially, there is no evidence other than one person’s word against another. It could set a bad precedent whereby one person’s testimony is enough to make someone suffer.” But Nadezhda has supporters here, including a former patient and a paramedic. “I’ve travelled down from St Petersburg because it’s so important for me to back a colleague,” ambulance medic Vera Rebrova tells me. “This is a trumped-up charge. I sympathise with her very much.” Speaking from the “aquarium”, Nadezhda tells me how much she values the display of solidarity. “The fact that I’m not abandoned, not alone, that people are thinking of me, it means so much,” she says. It also shows that, despite the fear in society, some Russians are taking a stand against snitching and the direction in which their country is moving. Among those willing to speak out is 87-year-old Dmitry Grinchy, who has invited me to tea. He tells me what happened to him recently on a Moscow bus. A passenger claimed to have overheard Dmitry making insulting comments about Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine and physically attacked him. “He lunged at me, flashing his eyes and gnashing his teeth as if he wanted to bite me,” Dmitry recalls. “He called over his son, a big guy, who pressed his finger into my arm to hurt me. I’ve got bruises.” Shocking mobile phone video shows the pensioner having his arms twisted behind his back and being dragged off the bus. The two men frogmarched Dmitry to the police. He was not charged. But the incident has left Dmitry shaken and angry. “The Russian Constitution says everyone has the right to free speech. Why should others get to say what they think and not me?” Under Joseph Stalin, Dmitry’s father was arrested and executed, one of the many innocent victims of Stalin’s Terror.  Russia’s past is a painful one.  But it is the present that worries Dmitry. With the authorities here, once again, searching for enemies and traitors - and the public encouraged to join in the hunt."

The car parks at the Hucknall and Phoenix Park tram terminals were due to be extended by a combined 800 spaces. An increase in home working since the Covid pandemic means there is now less demand, according to a report by Nottingham City Council. The funding is set to be reallocated to other transport projects, in which costs have increased. The council, together with Derby City Council, had secured £161m from the government's ""Transforming Cities Fund"" in 2019. The Labour-run authority initially proposed spending its share of the money on 35 different projects across the city, but a new report says only 33 will go ahead. Plans to improve cycle connections between Nottingham and Derby have also been dropped. The council said the changes had been agreed with the Department for Transport. The report, set to be discussed at a meeting on Monday, says the pandemic ""significantly impacted on the use of public transport, with changes to working patterns and a greater uptake of hybrid working resulting in people commuting less frequently"". It adds there have been ""significant effects on materials supply, energy and construction costs, and delivery timescales"" for the entire programme as a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Twenty-one of the 33 schemes have already been completed with the majority of the remaining works now in their final year. Work on the final project, a new pedestrian and cycle bridge over the River Trent, is due to begin in early 2025. Nottingham Express Transit (NET) has been approached for comment.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgvr9kgkqyo,China is part of the US election - but only from one candidate,There is a stark difference in how - and how often - each candidate addresses the US-China relationship.,27 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.102662,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The US and China are the two largest economies in the world. They have the two most powerful militaries in the world. The US-China rivalry, in the view of many international analysts, will be the defining global theme of the 21st Century. But at the moment, only one of the two major party presidential candidates is regularly talking about US-China policy - as he has done consistently for years. According to a review by BBC Verify, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has mentioned China 40 times in his five rallies since the presidential debate earlier this month. In just one hour at a town hall forum last week in Michigan, he brought up the country 27 times. And when he talks about China, Trump focuses on matters of tension between the two global powers, painting the country and the world’s second-largest economy, as a kind of economic predator. He has talked about the new tariffs he plans to impose on imports from Chinese companies – and those from other nations -  should he return to the White House.  He has said he wants to prevent Chinese-made cars from being sold because he believes they will destroy the American auto industry. He has warned China not to attempt to replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And he has blamed the Chinese government for the Covid pandemic. Many economists question the effectiveness of Trump’s tariff plans and warn that they would ultimately be harmful to US consumers. The Biden-Harris administration, however, has maintained, and even at times increased, the more narrowly focused tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term in office. Trump’s protectionist message is tailored to blue-collar voters in the key industrial Midwest battleground states who have felt the impact of increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.  Meanwhile, BBC Verify finds, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris did not mention China at all in her six rallies since the 10 September debate. Although, in a speech on the economy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday afternoon, she made a handful of references to the country. “I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, communities, and companies,” she said at that event. Asked for comment, an aide to the vice-president told the BBC that even if Harris does not talk about China regularly, she has a record of working to counter what they described as China’s efforts to undermine global stability and prosperity. But when it comes to discussing China, the contrast between Trump and Harris on the campaign trail is unmistakable. On Monday afternoon, at a barn in Smithton, a small town in rural western Pennsylvania, Trump sat down with a group of local farmers and ranchers for a roundtable discussion specifically about China. The town may be just an hour outside of Pittsburgh, a Democratic Party urban stronghold, but this was decidedly Republican territory. Cows grazed peacefully on grasslands lined with dozens of “Trump for President signs”, while Trump supporters decorated two donkeys in “Make America Great Again” gear. The topic of the event, hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, a conservative think-tank, was “the Chinese Communist Party's growing threat to the US food supply”. The forum ended up being a more open-ended conversation about the threat of China, full stop. The farmers, ranchers and business executives on the panel complained about having to compete with heavily subsidised Chinese imports and about the low quality of Chinese goods. While the former president didn’t spend much time discussing the perceived dangers of Chinese ownership of US farmland – he instead promised that he would convince Chinese President Xi Jinping to buy more US agriculture exports – he again emphasised that he would use tariffs to shield the American economy from China. At one point, he spoke of the need to protect the US steel industry - in order to prepare for a hypothetical war with China. “If we’re in a war, and we need army tanks and we need ships and we need other things that happen to be made of steel, what are we going to do, go to China and get the steel?” he asked. “We’re fighting China, but would you mind selling us some steel?” Some of the heavier lifting on China during the forum was left to Richard Grenell, a roundtable panelist and senior advisor for the Protecting America Initiative. He warned the country has “quietly but strategically” worked against the US – particularly when Americans were distracted by other global issues. “They go after our local and state politicians; they go after our manufacturing,” he said. “There is no question they are looking to, at some point, leverage that investment and activity.” Grenell, who served as US ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence while Trump was in office, is considered a possible secretary of state - America’s top diplomat - if Trump wins another term in November. If Harris wins, on the other hand, there may not be a significant change from the current Biden administration, even if the current president has frequently deployed sharper rhetoric to describe the US-China rivalry. Since the start of his presidency, Joe Biden has identified China as one of the autocracies competing with the world’s leading democracies in what he describes as a historic global inflection point. According to public opinion surveys, China ranks low on the list of issues American voters care about – dwarfed by the economy, immigration and healthcare.  In a recent National Security Action survey of voters in key electoral battleground states, only 14% listed China as the top national security priority for the next president. Immigration led the list at 38%, followed by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, both at 28%. That could in part explain Harris’s seeming lack of interest in talking about China. In this abbreviated presidential campaign for her, she has a shorter timeframe to define herself in the eyes of voters, so focusing on America's main economic competitor may be less of a priority for the Democrat.  After the Trump event in Smithton, Bill Bretz, chair of the local county Republican Party committee, said that while China may not be at the top of voter concerns in Pennsylvania, it was important for Trump to talk about it. As the largest up-for-grabs electoral prize, Pennsylvania is perhaps the pivotal state in the 2024 presidential election. Both Trump and Harris will be hard-pressed to win the White House without it in their column. Polls currently show the two candidates in a dead heat there. “The majority of people have already picked the camp that they're in, but there are those group of people that are undecided,” he said. “If China is a straw that sways the scale one way or another, I think it's a great thing to bring up.” Additional reporting by Jake Horton and BBC Verify North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlg2xj5qno,Iranian missiles to Russia change Ukraine debate - Lammy,"On a visit to Kyiv, the UK foreign secretary said the UK would provide £600m in aid to Ukraine.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.293101,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The delivery of Iranian missiles to Russia has changed the debate about Ukraine using Western-provided long-range missiles against targets inside Russia, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Lammy travelled to the Ukrainian capital with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken after talks in London. They met President Volodymr Zelensky, who has repeatedly called for allies to loosen limits on the use of Western-supplied weapons. The US and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia for fear of escalation. At a news conference in Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken said US President Joe Biden would likely discuss the use of long-range missiles with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the White House on Friday. Asked about the risk of escalation, the US secretary of state added: ""We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr Putin and Russia.""  Lammy would not be drawn into whether the US and UK would be allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles, but said: ""I am not prepared to give Putin the advantage.""  Biden has said his administration is considering lifting the restrictions, but no decision has yet been made public. On Wednesday, Zelensky said Kyiv's victory in the war against Russia ""depends mostly on the support of the United States"". Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said steps towards lifting long-range missile restrictions ""are important in the context of reports of a possible transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia by Iran"". ""We must act boldly,"" he added. In an interview with the BBC, Lammy said Iran providing Russia with ballistic missiles ""clearly changes the debate"" as they would allow Moscow's forces ""to have further penetration into Ukraine"". ""That is very dangerous,"" Lammy said, adding: ""As we see the Russians working with their partners, we see this transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia, it is important that we do more to support Ukraine to win in their efforts."" On Wednesday, Lammy said the UK would provide £600m ($780m) in aid to Ukraine to support the country's ""humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs"". Blinken announced a further $700m in assistance to Ukraine, including funding for the energy sector and demining.  The new aid came after the US, UK, France and Germany imposed further sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. The UK government summoned Iran's top diplomat over the accusations. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked Lammy for the UK’s military support for Ukraine throughout the war. But he added: “We hope that long-range equipment for strikes on the territory of our enemy will be reached and we will have it and we hope for your help and support in this issue.” Asked by reporters on Tuesday if the US would lift restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons, President Biden said his administration was ""working that out now"". Earlier this year, the US loosened some of the restraints, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike areas along Russia's border where troops are firing from. Kyiv's other allies have also been supplying some long-range weapons - with restrictions on how and when they can be used inside Russia, out of concern such strikes could prompt retaliation that draws Nato countries into the war or provokes a nuclear conflict. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Russia would respond ""appropriately"" if the US were to allow Ukrainian missile strikes on its territory. During a visit to the UK before travelling to Kyiv, Blinken accused Iran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, saying they could be deployed against Ukrainians within weeks. Lammy described Iran's move as ""a significant and dangerous escalation”. The missiles are likely to boost Russia's arsenal, enabling it to hit Ukrainian cities close to Russia's borders or areas it already controls at the same time as it deploys its longer-range missiles deeper into Ukrainian territory. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi denied his country was supplying missiles to Russia, accusing Western countries of ""acting on faulty intelligence and flawed logic"". The UK has given Ukraine Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range of about 250km (155 miles). So far, they have been used only against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territory. But Ukrainian leaders say they need the missiles to target air bases used by Russian warplanes to launch devastating glide bombs against Ukraine. These weapons are often launched from deep inside Russian territory. Additional reporting by Thomas Mackintosh and Robert Plummer in London."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gllnx0p40o,Facebook owner bans Russian state media networks,Russian state media outlets have come under increased scrutiny in Western countries.,17 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.507025,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Facebook owner Meta says it is banning several Russian state media networks, alleging they use deceptive tactics to conduct influence operations and avoid detection on its platforms. ""After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,"" Meta said. In a news bulletin, RT newsreader Eunan O'Neill said the broadcaster ""and Russia as a whole denies the accusations that have been coming en masse against this channel and others in the past number of days"". The bans are expected to come into effect in the next few days. The Russian embassy in Washington and the owner of the Sputnik news agency, Rossiya Segodnya, did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. Russian state media outlets have come under increased scrutiny over claims they have tried to influence politics in Western countries. As well as Facebook, social media giant Meta owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. In a statement to the BBC, RT said: ""It’s cute how there’s a competition in the West — who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better.  ""Don’t worry, where they close a door, and then a window, our ‘partisans’ (or in your parlance, guerrilla fighters) will find the cracks to crawl through — as by your own admission we are apt at doing."" Meta's move marks an escalation in the world's biggest social media firm's stance towards Russian state media companies. Two years ago, Meta took more limited measures to restrict the spread of Russian state-controlled media, including stopping the outlets from running adverts on its platforms and limiting the reach of their content. After the start of the war in Ukraine, Meta - like other social media platforms - complied with requests from the EU, UK and Ukraine to block some Russian state media in those regions. Earlier this month, the US accused state broadcaster RT of paying a Tennessee firm $10m (£7.6m) to ""create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging"". An indictment said videos - which often promoted right-wing narratives on issues such as immigration, gender and the economy - were secretly ""edited, posted, and directed"" by two RT employees. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced new sanctions against RT, accusing it of being a ""de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus"". The top US diplomat told reporters on Friday that RT was part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets which have sought to covertly ""undermine democracy in the United States"". He added that the Russian government has ""embedded within RT, a unit with cyber-operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence"". RT livestreamed Mr Blinken's remarks on X and declared it the ""US's latest conspiracy theory""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4xz013zx7o,Austria's far right eyes unprecedented election win,Sunday's election could see Herbert Kickl's party top the polls for the first time.,28 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:12.711860,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Austrians vote on Sunday in a general election that could see the far-right opposition Freedom Party (FPÖ) top the polls for the first time.  Five years ago, the party crashed out of a coalition government with the conservative People’s Party because of a corruption scandal dubbed Ibiza-gate. But now, led by Herbert Kickl, the FPÖ is within reach of a historic victory. It narrowly leads the ruling conservatives in the opinion polls, and the opposition Social Democrats are in third place. Even if the Freedom Party manages to come first, no party is expected to win enough seats for an outright majority, and building a coalition is likely to be difficult. The FPÖ has successfully tapped into concerns about migration, rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and anger over the way the Covid pandemic was handled, and for months has been hovering around 27% in the polls, up to two points ahead of the conservative Österreichische Volkspartei (ÖVP) or Austrian People's Party, which is predicting a photo finish. “The chances have never been so great,” one of its campaign videos says. “As Volkskanzler (people's chancellor) Herbert Kickl will do everything to give you back your freedom, your security, your Wohlstand (prosperity) and your peace... Let’s build Fortress Austria!” It then shows Kickl saying that he wants to be “your servant and your protector”. Kickl’s use of the term Volkskanzler, which was used to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, has worried some Austrians.  For them it is an uncomfortable reminder of the FPÖ’s origins. It was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s. Protesters at the party's final election rally on Friday night waved banners reading ""Nazis out of parliament"".  Like other far-right European parties, the FPÖ combines tough rhetoric on immigration and Islam with promises to reduce what it regards as interference from Brussels in national affairs. But Kickl has also aligned his party closely with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the self-styled champion of ""illiberal democracy"" and expressed a more conciliatory tone when it comes to Russia. The Freedom Party leader has called European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen a ""warmonger"" and opposes sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Political analyst Thomas Hofer says Kickl’s rhetoric has always been “very harsh and divisive”, but he believes election victory would not necessarily clear the way to heading a coalition government. “Of course it would be a totally new situation in the history of the Second Republic in Austria, because the Freedom Party came close a couple of times, but was never in first place, at least not on the general election level,"" he told the BBC. The party stunned European politicians under leader Jörg Haider in 1999, coming second in elections and joined a conservative-led government. When it joined a coalition in 2018, Herbert Kickl was interior minister, until the party became engulfed in corruption revelations. Now as leader the fiery Kickl has steered his party to what could be its best result yet. ""It would be a kind of shockwave for the other parties, but it doesn't mean if the  FPÖ comes in first, that they also will get the position of chancellor. This is by no means clear,” Thomas Hofer said. The FPÖ leader is widely disliked by other parties in Austria.  The conservative People’s Party, led by Austria’s current chancellor Karl Nehammer, has repeatedly excluded joining a Kickl-led government, although it has not ruled out an alliance with his party. Austria’s President, Alexander Van der Bellen, has also expressed his reluctance to see Kickl lead the country. Other parties including the Social Democrats and Greens have also said they won’t form a government with the FPÖ. ""No coalition with the far right,"" the Greens' Climate Action Minister Leonore Gewessler told the BBC. ""We will not work in a coalition with the far right FPÖ, which denies climate change, which only works on dividing our society and spreading fear and conspiracy theories."" Under Karl Nehammer, the conservatives have framed the vote as a choice between the incumbent chancellor or Kickl, seeking to attract centrist voters with slogans like “Vote Stability"" and ""Vote Centre”. Nehammer has said it is “impossible to form a government with someone who adores conspiracy theories”. Thomas Hofer highlights a lack of vision from both the conservatives and Social Democrats: ""One big reason why [the FPÖ] could have this comeback is certainly the weakness of the others."" He says forming a coalition government could take months. Although some 6.3 million Austrians aged 16 or over will be able to vote in Sunday's election, another 1.5 million long-term residents will not have the right, because of Austria’s highly restrictive citizenship laws.    Across the country that means almost one in five is excluded, whereas in Vienna the proportion is as high as one in three. To highlight the issue, a charity organised an unofficial vote that attracted almost 20,000 people called Pass Egal Wahl – which translates as a passport-doesn't-matter election.  Elisabeth Scherzenlehner, who teaches refugees German, brought her class along to the campaign group's rally in Vienna.  “I think the FPÖ is a really strong negative voice, and I think there will be no mercy if they will come to rule Austria,"" she said."

That approach, he says, was resulting in a number of “cauldrons”, large territories surrounded by the Russian forces. One of them is south of Pokrovsk - between Nevelske, Hirnyk and Krasnohorivka. “We are not planning to advance towards the city of Donetsk any time soon, so why are we holding positions near Nevelske when we’re losing Hirnyk?” said the officer.  Far better to retreat to Hirnyk, he believes, with a minimum loss of resources and hold those positions. “When your enemy has more people and resources than you do, this strategy is reckless,” the Ukrainian officer added. “Look at the Donetsk region, it looks like a squid. [To defend all the] tentacles, you need a far bigger number of positions, observation posts. You need to hold back far bigger assault groups because the Russians are trying to attack from all sides."" So, instead of withdrawing and reduce the length of the line they need to defend, the officer says, brigades get wiped out fighting along the entire perimeter of the ""cauldron"" simply because the main criteria of success for generals is to hold positions. Roman Pohorily, an analyst and co-founder of the Deep State map that monitors the latest frontline developments in Ukraine, says Ukrainian troops have now pulled back from the village of Nevelske to avoid an encirclement.  That means the threat of being trapped is less acute, but the military officer at the front says pulling back should have been done long before.  Lives and resources have been wasted on something that they couldn’t hold anyway, he argues. Russian troops are now advancing towards Kurakhove, a city 35km (21 miles) south of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian forces in that area confirm the fighting in their sectors has intensified lately. This development is also reflected in the daily briefings of Ukraine’s General Staff.  On Thursday they reported that there were 32 clashes in the Pokrovsk direction and 48 in the Kurakhove direction. “They’re trying to strengthen their flanks so that they can get closer to Pokrovsk, half encircle it and then start erasing the city to the ground,” says Maj Serhiy Tsekhotsky from the 59th Brigade. Lt Col Oleh Demyanenko, who commands a tank battalion of the 110th brigade, also says that Russian forces are now pushing along the sides, in addition to a direct assault on Pokrovsk.  However, he claims that the Russians are now focusing mostly on the southern flank – that’s the Kurakhove direction. Russian troops assault Ukrainian positions with small groups and often they’re not accompanied by armoured vehicles, soldiers say.  “They send two or three people who try to reach a certain point in the field,"" explains Maj Tsekhotsky. “Then others try to get to that point as well. And when they have 10-15 people, they try to attack us.” What makes the Kurakhove area challenging both to defend and to advance is that it’s flat, says Nazar Voytenkov from the 33rd Brigade.  “We constantly shell fields. Russians lose their vehicles and people.”   He says his brigade is successfully holding its position on the front line. Kurakhove is linked to Pokrovsk with roads that are part of the infrastructure to move troops and supplies on the front line. If the Russians take that city, then they can go north to attack Pokrovsk from a new direction, says analyst Roman Pohorily.   Another possibility is that they might attack Ukrainian troops in Vuhledar from behind, he adds. That’s a city on the southern part of the Donbas frontline that the Russians have been trying to seize since the beginning of their full-scale invasion. Strategic mistakes made in the past mean that there is only one way left to defend Pokrovsk and stop the Russians seizing the entire Donetsk region, according to the officer on the front line. ""To have another Bakhmut”, in his words, referring to the city in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv defended for nearly a year before retreating, with the city in ruins. “[They] will throw a lot of people and let them die there.”"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvglq47y9o,Migrants feel less welcome as Germany's far-right rises,"Migrants who arrived since 2015 say they feel unwelcome in Germany, where the far-right Alternative for Germany is gaining support.",21 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:13.356259,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"On Sunday, voters in the eastern German state of Brandenburg will vote for a new regional parliament. The anti-migrant far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, could win the most votes. On 1 September the AfD won a major German election for the first time, coming first in the eastern state of Thuringia. In Brandenburg polls show the AfD leading with 28%. To undermine support for the AfD, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left wing-led government on Monday introduced checks for migrants on all of Germany’s borders. He also wants to increase deportations of people whose application for asylum is unsuccessful. Opposition conservatives meanwhile want the borders closed to asylum seekers altogether. This is a very different country to the Germany of Angela Merkel. Almost a decade ago the then-chancellor refused to shut the borders to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution in Syria and Afghanistan. “Wir schaffen das”, or “We can do it”, she famously said.  In 2015 and 2016 Germany took in around 1.5 million refugees and migrants, mostly from the Middle East. They were greeted at train stations with signs saying “welcome” and smiling volunteers handing out food and toys. A new German word was invented, “Willkommenskultur” or “welcome culture”, and many Germans were suddenly proud of the country’s new-found identity as a safe haven for refugees. Today, many of those refugees are becoming German themselves. A record 200,000 people became German citizens in 2023. The largest group came from Syria. These are the New Germans. The “2015 generation” is described as highly motivated by experts. Many could have stayed in Lebanon and Turkey, but pushed themselves on to Germany to make a new life. They are on average younger than the native-born population - 26 years old compared to the German average of 47 - and statistically more likely to be in work: 84% of the Syrian men who arrived in 2015 are in employment, compared to 81% of German-born men. But with the rise of the AfD and an ever harsher tone towards migrants in mainstream politics, the 2015 “welcome culture” is hard to find today. Fewer refugees are now coming to Germany, with new arrivals down this year by 22% compared to the same period in 2023. But overall 3.48 million refugees are now living in the country — more than at any time since the 1950s. A third are from Ukraine.  Some local councils say they are struggling to cope logistically and financially. Right-wingers and the AfD say numbers are too high. Left-wingers blame the finance ministry's obsession with balancing the books and refusal to take on new debt. Add that to an enormous boost in military spending after Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, and there is a nervousness in Germany that money and resources are tight. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s argumentative and divided coalition government has not helped voters feel more secure in the country’s leadership. So how do the New Germans feel about this shift in mood in Germany? Parvin was one of those who arrived in 2015, travelling for months, mostly walking, from Afghanistan to Germany with her three-year old son and disabled nephew. They were shot at by border guards and she feared for her life when the overcrowded dinghy they were in starting sinking in the Mediterranean. She has now just received her German citizenship and this summer qualified as a social worker. A refugee success story, you might think. But she says the atmosphere has got worse for migrants since 2015. “I don't feel welcome here,” she tells me. “The rise of the far right and the hate towards refugees is mostly because of the bad picture of refugees in German media,” she says. “When one refugee does something bad, the media makes it really big. And then of course people think that all refugees are bad.” The latest political debate over migration started in August, after a stabbing in the town of Solingen, in which three people were killed. The suspect is a Syrian asylum seeker who the authorities had wanted to deport. The following week saw multiple knife attacks across Germany not involving refugees — including two separate stabbings in Berlin in which women were killed by their ex-partners. These cases did not hit headlines. The far-right AfD immediately used the Solingen stabbing as part of its election campaign for September’s regional election in Thuringia. Two hours after the attack AfD regional leader Björn Höcke, who has been legally defined by German courts as a fascist and fined for using a Nazi slogan at rallies, posted on X “vote for change on 1.9” alongside the hashtag Solingen. In Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, I meet Sultana, as she organises a protest against the far right. She fled to Germany a decade ago from Afghanistan, when she was 10 years old. She is now about to go to university to study law, speaks German to mother-tongue level and is politically active, often addressing large demonstrations. But she can’t vote. She has applied for German citizenship but is still waiting for an answer. Sultana’s mother Latifa tells me that she is terrified that, after rebuilding their lives here in Germany, the family might have to flee again. This time, to escape the far right. “We are incredibly afraid and we know we are being threatened. But you have to understand that this has been the reality for years,” Sultana says, and adds that the problem is not just the AfD, but the racism that she, and many others, regularly experience. “I speak German, I dream German, my whole life revolves around being German.  I ask myself what more do I have to do, to be recognised as German,” she tells me with tears in her eyes. For Sultana the answer is to get even more politically active. “We have no choice. Many of the migrants have no citizenship, and so have no right to vote. But we have voices and we want to take these voices out onto the streets and say: we are here and we are staying here!” But other New Germans are thinking about leaving altogether. As soon as she got her German passport, Parvin was finally able to visit her sister in London for the first time, in August. Now that she is a qualified social worker, she is even thinking about moving to the UK. She tells me she felt more welcome there. A study published last week by DeZIM, an institute that researches migration, found that almost a quarter of people with a migration background, many of them German citizens, are considering emigrating because of the rise of the far-right. Almost 10 percent say they have concrete plans to leave Germany. The paradox is that the government is desperate to attract workers to Germany. But the increasingly hostile rhetoric over migration may not only put people off coming, but also push away those go-getting New Germans who are already leading successful lives here. Damien's documentary on the New Germans will be broadcast on the BBC World Service and will be available to listen to here. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623pq2581go,"No impunity for Russia over Ukraine, ICC says",The chief prosecutor of the ICC told the BBC his team are doing all they can to deliver justice for crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:32.740676,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has said his team are doing all they can to deliver justice for crimes committed by Russia during its war in Ukraine. Karim Khan was speaking on a visit to Ohmatdyt, Ukraine’s largest children's hospital in Kyiv, which was hit by a missile in July killing two adults and a young boy. Mr Khan, who is the first British prosecutor of the ICC, told the BBC: ""We're here for a purpose. It's not a sightseeing visit. It's to move forward... to make sure we pierce the veil of impunity and make sure the law is felt."" Mr Khan met doctors and patients outside Ohmatdyt's shattered intensive care unit and was shown fragments of what Ukrainian investigators said was a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile. Russia has claimed the blast was caused by a misfiring Ukrainian air defence missile, but the United Nations said it was “highly likely” Moscow was indeed behind the attack. I put it to Mr Khan that if he thought the Russian account was credible he would not have come to the hospital, which was the first leg of this trip. Mr Khan said he had a ""duty to investigate incriminating and exonerating evidence"" and that his team was examining the remnants of the missile, which bear serial numbers. The strike on the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital came during a wave of Russian missile and drone attacks across the country which Ukrainian officials said killed at least 46 people - including 33 in Kyiv - and injured nearly 200. Around 1200 patients and staff were in the hospital complex at the time of the attack. Among them was 16-year-old Solomia Fomeniuk, who was receiving kidney dialysis for the chronic renal failure she has suffered from since birth. Footage from the day of the attack showed her mum, Oksana, desperately calling out for her amid the smoking rubble, before they were later reunited. Solomia is now being treated in the western city of Lviv, 470km (290 miles) from Kyiv, because her specialist unit was one of those destroyed. On a video call, she told us she remembers fear being her overriding emotion that morning. “It was very scary, but I tried not to listen to the explosions and kept calm. But when the rocket hit, I didn't immediately understand what had happened.” Then came the realisation that the hospital had suffered an attack. She said she remembered a doctor, covered in blood, pulling her and another young patient from the rubble. Solomia's mum, Oksana, said it was a miracle they had both survived the strike, and said the attack had ""a heavy impact on our lives, even tragic. It is difficult to live after this.” At the hospital, Mr Khan was given a private briefing by Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Andriy Kostin, who is in charge of the court prosecution system in the country and has previously called on the ICC to investigate the hospital attack as a war crime. The presentation was held in the car park of the hospital and showed information about the type of missile used, fragments of which were laid out and numbered. The hospital’s director previously told the UN Security Council that the strike severely damaged several departments, including the intensive care units and oncology and surgical wings, and completely destroyed the toxicology and traumatology departments. Mr Kostin told the BBC that every effort was being made to eventually bring prosecutions at the ICC. “Ukrainians live in a very difficult time... every day between hope and belief for the better future,"" he said.  ""But on the accountability and justice track, I think that we can give belief, we can provide belief because justice will be served,"" Mr Kostin added. ""And it's not only about arrest warrants already issued. We understand that at some stage, we will need people behind the bars in The Hague.” In March 2023 the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and more warrants were put out earlier this year for Russia's former defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.  Mr Kostin added that every legal avenue would be pursued. ""There is no statute of limitations for the time,"" he said. ""We understand that our work is for years, maybe for decades, but our commitment is to do it as soon as it is possible.” Meanwhile, Solomia is looking for a kidney donor. If one is found, she could stop dialysis and her life would be immeasurably improved. A transplant would hopefully allow her to drink more than one glass of water a day, which she said is very little, particularly in the summer. When we asked her mum what she thought of the ICC investigating the attack on the hospital, she was sceptical anything would happen. “I think that this will not lead to anything, to any positive result,” Oksana said. “The ICC finds Putin guilty - and what next? There are international organisations in the world that could prevent all this happening in Ukraine. But no one has done anything so far.” Later, during Mr Khan’s visit, we asked him what his message would be to Oksana. He acknowleged that while his team's work would not ""bring the dead back to life,"" they were doing their best. ""If everybody plays their part, hopefully it can mitigate some of the harrowing stories that we're hearing around the world and also here in Ukraine.” Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr, Hanna Tsyba and Volodymyr Lozhko"

The country's security service, the FSB, said in a statement it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting ""a strategic defeat"" on Russia.  The UK Foreign Office said the accusations against the diplomats were ""completely baseless"".  While the BBC understands the diplomats involved left Russia many weeks ago, the announcement coincides with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Washington, where he is expected to discuss whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western long-range missiles at targets inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested Moscow will regard this as a serious escalation in the war which equates to the ""direct participation"" of Nato countries. ""If that is the case, we will take corresponding decisions based on the threats that will be created to us,"" he said on state TV. The UK Foreign Office said that Russia revoked the diplomatic accreditations last month, following action the UK had taken against Russian state-directed activity in the UK and Europe.  ""We are unapologetic about protecting our national interests,"" a spokesperson said. Former national security advisor Lord Peter Ricketts said the allegations levelled at the six diplomats were ""trumped up"".  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was a retaliatory punishment for the UK's continued military support of Ukraine ahead of the meeting in Washington. He added that it was Putin's way of trying to ""intimidate western politicians"".   Diplomatic accreditation is given by the host nation to recognise a person’s diplomatic status, as set out by the UN.  Without it, a person does not have official diplomatic status. Announcing the decision on Friday, the FSB said the diplomats had shown signs of conducting intelligence gathering and were tasked with inflicting a ""strategic defeat on our country"". In a Telegram post, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow ""fully share[s] the assessments"" made by the FSB on the activities of the diplomats. ""The British embassy has gone far beyond the limits outlined by the Vienna Conventions [UN treaty on diplomatic relations],"" she said. An FSB officer told Russian media ""hints"" to ""stop this practice [of gathering intelligence]"" were not heeded. The security service added that it would revoke accreditation from more British diplomats if they are found to be involved in similar activity. Noele Crossley, an associate professor in international security, told the BBC it was a ""worrying sign that bilateral relations are deteriorating further"". The University College London professor said ""the diplomatic crisis reflects wider geopolitical and strategic tensions"", adding that there may be ""hostile rhetoric"" still to come from Russia. Prof Mark Galeotti, an expert on modern Russia at the Rusi think tank, told the BBC the revocation was bad news for an embassy already ""pared to the bone"" in a country the UK needed to maintain diplomatic connections. He said that while former Soviet Union leaders would occasionally expel diplomats, they ""understood that it was important to have robust diplomatic connections"".  President Putin, he said, had gone further, which was ""alarming"". The diplomats involved were named and pictured on Russian state TV earlier on Friday. Expulsions of diplomats have become increasingly common since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Earlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attaché was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an ""undeclared military intelligence officer"". On Wednesday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would provide £600m ($780m) in aid to Ukraine to support the country's ""humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs"". Last week's summit in Germany also saw the UK commit to sending hundreds more short-range missiles to Ukraine, with the US pledging a further $250m (£189.9m) in military aid.

The governor of Moscow, Andrei Vorobyov, said several flats in two high-rise apartment buildings in Ramenskoye in Moscow region were set on fire. Mr Vorobyov said a 46-year-old woman died and three people were injured in Ramenskoye, while 43 people were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres. Ukraine has so far not commented on the attacks, but the Kremlin on Tuesday said the attack showed Ukraine was Russia's enemy. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a daily call with reporters that the strike showed the need for Russia to continue its war in Ukraine, saying: ""We must continue the military operation in order to protect ourselves from such displays of this regime."" Russia's defence ministry said earlier that of the 144 drones that its air defences intercepted, half were in the western border region of Bryansk, 20 were in Moscow and 14 were over the Kursk region. State media reported that the strikes shut down four airports in Moscow and more than 30 domestic and international flights that serve the Russian capital were suspended. Russia's aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, confirmed on Telegram on Tuesday morning that three of the airports -  Domodedovo, Zhukovsky and Vnukovo - had resumed operations. In other developments on Tuesday, Russia said it had captured at least three villages in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The defence ministry also said it had ""liberated"" the town of Krasnohorivka, also in Donetsk. Separately, the Ukrainian Air Force said on Telegram that its air defences downed 38 out of 46 Shahed-type attack drones launched by Russia. They were shot down over a number of regions and cities including Kyiv, Odesa, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltova. The air force added that Russia also launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile and a Kh-31 air-to-surface missile. Ukraine and Russia regularly launch overnight drone raids on each other's territory. The latest wave of drone strikes comes as Moscow claims gains in eastern Ukraine. In the last two days, Moscow said its forces had captured Memryk and Novohrodivka - two villages that are 24km and 10km from the key town of Pokrovsk.  Kyiv has not commented, but sources told the BBC that Ukrainian forces had retreated from Novohrodivka. So far this month, Russia has launched a wave of deadly strikes on Lviv, Poltava and Kharkiv. Russia's response to Ukraine has hardened after Kyiv launched its offensive into the country's Kursk region last month."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984zenjkz5o,Russia accused of EU and Nato cyber-attacks,The warning by Germany comes amid fears in Europe of suspected Russian interference since the war in Ukraine.,9 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:33.040603,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A notorious Russian military unit has carried out cyber-attacks on Ukrainian allies around the world designed to disrupt aid efforts, according to a joint defence briefing by Western intelligence agencies. They said attacks both before and after the full-scale invasion in February 2022 were carried out by the same group believed to be behind the poisonings of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018. Unit 29155, which has been linked to high-profile espionage and sabotage campaigns in recent years, expanded into cyber operations in 2020, agencies in the UK, US and several other countries said in a joint statement. The intervention comes as European governments seek to counter what they say is increased Russian espionage in the wake of the Ukraine war. A spike in cyber-attacks on Ukraine ahead of the February 2022 invasion had previously been widely reported. But an expert told the BBC the joint warning issued this this week suggested a broader range of activity than previously disclosed took place against several European countries. “The focus at the time was all to do with what they were trying to do to Ukraine,” said Keir Giles, an expert on Russian cyber activities at the UK-based Chatham House think tank. “What these latest announcements made clear is that the targets were much broader than that, and they're talking about a range of different government and civilian agencies, civil society agencies across Western Europe and across the EU and Nato.” Intelligence agencies in the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Canada and Australia all signed the declaration.  Western intelligence agencies said the attacks were carried out by a division within Unit 29155. The cyber team has used names including Cadet Blizzard and Ember Bear, they said. It said the hackers were ""responsible for the WhisperGate campaign"", a coordinated attack on Ukrainian government agencies in January 2022, and has since been focussed on attempts to ""scout and disrupt"" aid deliveries to Kyiv. Critical infrastructure, government agencies and private companies involved in finance, transport, energy and health have all been targeted across a number of EU and Nato member states, as well as in Asia and Latin America, it claimed. Mr Giles said the activities referred to in the note appear to relate to 2022, but added: “People need to be aware that this stuff is ongoing and that Russia is attacking us."" He continued: “What's particularly pronounced at the moment about Russia's cyber activities is the way they look like preparation for an overt attack on Nato, particularly with the reconnaissance and preparation for sabotage of logistics links, rail networks and so on across Europe.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75n2wnkp1vo,UK halts all Iran flights as allies step up sanctions,The sanctions come as Western officials say Iran has supplied missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.,10 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:33.123768,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The US, UK, France and Germany have imposed fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. The measures include restrictions on national carrier Iran Air's ability to fly to the UK and Europe, and travel bans and asset freezes on a number of Iranians accused of facilitating military support for Russia. Visiting London, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russians had been trained by Iranian forces to use short-range ballistic missiles and that they could be deployed against Ukrainians within weeks. Iran has repeatedly denied supplying such self-guided weapons to Russia. At a joint news conference with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Tuesday, Blinken asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""increasingly relying on support"" from Iran and North Korea to help ""wage his war of aggression on Ukraine"" in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. He said the US had recently shared intelligence with its partners showing that dozens of military personnel had been trained in Iran to use the Fath-360 ballistic missile system, which has a maximum range of 75 miles (120km). Lammy said the move was  ""a significant and dangerous escalation”.  The missiles are likely to boost Russia's arsenal, enabling it to hit Ukrainian cities close to Russia's borders or areas it already controls at the same time as it deploys its longer-range missiles deeper into Ukrainian territory.  The UK Foreign Office said the US and UK sanctions targeted several key individuals heavily involved in the ballistic missile and drone supply chains. They included Brig Gen Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari, who it said was director general for international relations at Iran’s defence ministry and was linked to its exports of defence products to its partners. Sanctions have also been imposed on five Russian cargo ships for transporting the military supplies from Iran, despite what the UK said were repeated warnings not to do so. Additionally, several organisations, including some allegedly involved in the production of Iran's kamikaze-style Shahed drones - which Russia has used consistently in attacks on Ukrainian cities - have been sanctioned. In a statement, the UK, France and Germany - known as the E3 - said Iran's supply of missiles represented a ""a direct threat to European security"". But Iran called the Western statements ""false and misleading"". The Western sanctions come as Russia has continued to make gains in eastern Ukraine, with Moscow's forces rapidly approaching the key settlement of Pokrovsk - an essential transport hub.  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made clear the UK government will continue to back Ukraine for as long as needed. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticised the pace of weapons deliveries, and asked for authorisation to strike targets deep inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles - a move the US has thus far resisted.  Blinken and Lammy also announced a joint trip to Ukraine this week, the first such trip in years as UK diplomats seek to frame the secretary of state's visit as a reaffirmation of a close partnership between the two countries, often described as the ""special relationship"". Blinken said one of their goals ahead of the visit was to ""hear directly from the Ukrainian leadership"" about their ""objectives and what we can do to support those needs""."

Nearby, artists paint Russian President Vladimir Putin’s portrait on a wall during a graffiti festival.  Welcome to Burkina Faso, one of the African nations where Russia is boosting its operations to gain influence. Evidence found by the BBC shows that Russia is using media and cultural initiatives to attract African journalists, influencers, and students while spreading misleading information. These events are being promoted by African Initiative, a newly founded Russian media organisation which defines itself as an “information bridge between Russia and Africa”. It inherited structures previously set up by the dismantled Wagner mercenary group and is believed by experts to have links with the Russian security services. Registered in September 2023, a month after Wagner’s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash, African Initiative has welcomed former employees from his disbanded enterprises. Its efforts have been particularly focused on the three military-run countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.  Following recent coups, these West African nations have distanced themselves from Western allies like France, criticising their failed interventions against jihadist groups and colonial legacies. They have instead pivoted towards Russia. Alongside cultural events on the ground, African Initiative maintains a news website with stories in Russian, English, French, and Arabic, as well as a video channel and five Telegram channels, one of which has almost 60,000 subscribers. Some of the Telegram channels were “recycled” from older ones which had been set up by groups linked to Wagner. They were the first to promote the Russian Defence Ministry's paramilitary group Africa Corps, which has effectively replaced the military wing of Wagner in West Africa. Pro-Kremlin narratives and misleading information, especially about the United States, are rife. Stories on the African Initiative’s website suggest without evidence that the US is using Africa as a production and testing ground for bio-weapons, building on long-discredited Kremlin disinformation campaigns. One story echoes the Kremlin’s unsubstantiated claims about US bio-labs being relocated from Ukraine to Africa. Another maintains without evidence that US bio-labs on the continent are increasing, claiming that “under the guise of research and humanitarian projects, the African continent is becoming a testing ground for the Pentagon”, suggesting that secretive biological experiments are being conducted. While Prigozhin’s propaganda efforts targeted mainly France, African Initiative “targets Americans to a greater degree,” says researcher Jedrzej Czerep, head of the Middle East and Africa Programme at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. “It’s far more anti-American.”  In June, a group of bloggers and reporters from eight countries were invited for a seven-day “press tour” of the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The trip was organised by Russian state media and Western-sanctioned Russian officials, and the journalists visited African Initiative’s headquarters in Moscow. ""Africa wasn’t getting much information [about the war],"" Raymond Agbadi, a Ghanaian blogger and scientist who studied in Russia and who participated in the “press tour”, told the BBC. ""Whatever information we were getting was not convincing enough for us to understand what the war was really about.” American influencer Jackson Hinkle, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has spread multiple false claims about Ukraine, was also on the visit.  After visiting Moscow, the journalists travelled 1,250km (780 miles) to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region. Then they went to towns in the Zaporizhzhia region – all areas which were captured by Russia early in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Throughout the visit, the reporters were accompanied by Russian officials and travelled with the Russian military in vehicles marked with the Z sign – the symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In May, African Initiative organised a separate “press tour” to Russian-occupied Mariupol for a delegation of bloggers from Mali. Press trips for journalists are a widely used tool to attempt to sell a country’s viewpoints. But while “Western media does a lot of progressive training [for journalists] to report on key topics which have become global concerns, Russia uses these guided tours as a way of propagating certain narratives,” says Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst at Control Risks and the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, noting that China organises similar tours. Having African journalists report on their trips gives an “impression of authenticity” because they “reach out to the audience on languages they recognise”, rather than looking like it is part of “a wider campaign used to portray Russia in a positive light,” says Ms Ochieng. In stories published since the trip, the African journalists refer to the Ukrainian cities occupied by Russian forces as ""conflict zones in Russia"" and quote Russian-installed authorities, echoing Russian state propaganda and presenting the Kremlin’s view of Ukraine’s borders. In a piece published on JoyOnline, an English-speaking website operated by the Multimedia Group, Ghanaian journalist Ivy Setordjie writes that the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia region [whose capital is under Ukrainian control], is ""located in the south of European Russia."" She tells the BBC she disagrees that the regions were illegally annexed by Russia, affirming that her reports are reflections of her own judgement and “not tilted towards” the country. Beyond press tours, local affiliates of African Initiative in West Africa's Sahel region have been actively involved in community outreach efforts aimed at boosting Russia’s image. The BBC has been monitoring African Initiative’s Telegram channels and Facebook pages, where videos, images, and reports of their work on the ground are shared. In Burkina Faso, we found reports about a football competition where the Russian national anthem was played, “friendship lessons” in schools where students are taught about Russia, a competition of the Soviet martial art “sambo”, first aid workshops for citizens and policemen, and a graffiti festival where participants drew Russian President Vladimir Putin alongside Burkina Faso’s former leader Thomas Sankara, all sponsored by African Initiative. Images also show African Initiative members distributing groceries to locals and neighbourhood screenings of the Wagner-backed documentary The Tourist, about a group of Wagner instructors in the Central Africa Republic, where Wagner and its offshoots have been helping the government fight rebels for several years. “The original idea with the Africa Corps was to erase whatever military structures Prigozhin had developed and to replace it with something new. African Initiative, often serving as its media wing, was more accommodating and happy to reuse all assets that were already there,” says researcher Mr Czerep from the Polish Institute of International Affairs. The FSB, the Russian Federal Security Service, plays an important part in the new organisation, he notes. The head and editor-in-chief of African Initiative is Artyom Kureyev, identified by Russia experts as a Russian Federal Security Service agent. Mr Kureyev is linked to the Valdai Club, a Moscow-based think-tank close to President Putin. African Initiative’s website lists Anna Zamaraeva, a former Wagner press officer, as deputy editor-in-chief.  Viktor Lukovenko, known as one of Prigozhin’s “political technologists,” founded the Burkina Faso office of the African Initiative but left the position in recent months. A former Russian nationalist with a criminal past, Mr Lukovenko served five years in prison for an attack in Moscow on a Swiss citizen who later died. We reached out to African Initiative for comment. Its office in Moscow confirmed it had received our queries but its response did not reach us by email. The African Initiative reacted to the BBC story in an article on its website, quoting a response it said it had sent to the BBC. The organisation said its “humanitarian activities in the Sahel, such as the football competition” aimed to “improve Russian football and recruit new players” and the goal of film screenings and school lessons is to introduce the people of Africa to “the great Russian culture”. The organisation reiterated and defended the stories which were highlighted by the BBC as misleading, however it didn’t provide any new evidence. It referenced the Russian constitution and Russian laws as the justification for its terminology when referring to areas of occupied Ukraine as Russian territory. In February, in response to a report by the US Department of State, an article on African Initiative’s website stated that its editorial board “insists that its purpose is to spread knowledge about Africa in Russia and popularise Russia in African countries”, giving “various Africans an opportunity to be heard, including their criticisms of Western countries”. Meanwhile, the organisation continues intensifying its outreach in the Sahel. In the last week of August, about 100 students in Burkina Faso attended a talk about training opportunities in Russia.  ""I learned about the culture of Russia and the relation between our governments,"" said a smiling teenager wearing a T-shirt with an African Initiative logo in a video recorded after the discussion.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wj9qejrpwo,What the world thought of US debate,"How the Harris-Trump debate was seen from Putin's Kremlin, Ukraine's frontlines and Taliban-run Afghanistan.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:33.307940,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The first showdown between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was closely watched not only in the US but around the world. The debate in Philadelphia featured some tense exchanges on foreign policy between the two presidential candidates. From Beijing to Budapest, here's how the debate went down, according to BBC foreign correspondents. By Steve Rosenberg, Russia editor, Moscow Kamala Harris told Donald Trump that President Putin is “a dictator who would eat you for lunch.” The expression ""to eat someone for lunch"" (or breakfast, or any other meal) doesn’t exist in Russian. But one thing you will find in Moscow is the appetite for a US election result that benefits Russia. The Kremlin will have noted (with pleasure) that in the debate Trump sidestepped the question about whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. “I want the war to stop,” replied Trump. By contrast, Harris spoke of Ukraine’s “righteous defence” and accused Vladimir Putin of having “his eyes on the rest of Europe”. Later the Kremlin claimed to have been irked by all mentions of Putin in the debate. “Putin’s name is used as one of the instruments for the internal battle in the US,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told me. ""We don’t like this and hope they will keep our president’s name out of this.” Last week Putin claimed he was backing Harris in the election and praised her “infectious laugh.” Later a Russian state TV anchor clarified that Putin had been “slightly ironic” in his comments. The presenter was dismissive of Harris’ political skills and suggested she would be better off hosting a TV cooking show. I wonder: would it feature “dictators” eating US presidential candidates “for lunch""…? By Nick Beake, Europe correspondent, Kyiv Donald Trump’s failure, when asked on the debate stage to say if he wanted Ukraine to win the war, may not have surprised people here but it adds to their worry about what a second Trump term would bring. Trump has long boasted he could end in the conflict in 24 hours, a prospect many Ukrainians assume would mean an incredibly bad deal with Kyiv forced to give up huge swathes of the land Russia has seized over the past two and a half years. In contrast, Ukrainians will have been reassured by Kamala Harris’s responses, with no sign she would deviate from the current position of staunch American support. She took credit for the role she’s already played, arguing she shared important intelligence with President Zelensky in the days before the full-scale invasion. She then claimed Trump’s position would have been fatal for Ukraine had he still been in the White House. “If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.” Publicly, there has been a deafening silence from Ukraine’s current ministers and senior military in reaction to the debate. The figurative US electoral battle is one they need not weigh in to while they’re consumed by real fighting at home. It’s President Zelensky himself who so far has gone furthest in articulating, albeit somewhat euphemistically, what a Trump victory would mean for Ukrainians. Speaking to the BBC in July, he said it would mean “hard work, but we are hard workers”. By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent America’s longest war ended in August 2021 when it scrambled to pull out the last of its troops, and evacuate thousands of civilians, as the Taliban swept into Kabul with surprising speed. That debacle made it into the debate and, not surprisingly, the issues were dodged, dismissed, distorted. Harris veered away from the question “do you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?”. As a correspondent who followed the chaotic pullout closely, I never heard that the vice-president was in the room when decisions were taken in those final fateful weeks. But she made it clear she agreed with President Biden’s decision to leave. Trump boasted that he talked tough with “Abdul”, the “head of the Taliban” who is “still the head of the Taliban.” He seemed to be referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the withdrawal deal with the US. But he never headed the Taliban, and has been sidelined since the Taliban takeover. The mention immediately prompted a wave of internet memes featuring “Abdul” with people named Abdul weighing in, and others asking “who is Abdul?” Both contenders focused on the flawed deal with the Taliban. The truth is that the Trump team negotiated this exit plan; the Biden team hastily enacted it. Trump said the deal was good because “we were getting out”. There were no good ways to go. But the departure turned into a disaster and all sides are to blame. By Laura Bicker, China correspondent, Beijing Kamala Harris was an unknown quantity to leaders here and she still is, even after the debate. She has no track record on China and on the debate stage she simply repeated her line that the US, not China, would win the competition for the 21st Century. The vice-president represents something China does not like - uncertainty. That is why President Xi recently used a visit by US officials to call for “stability” between the two superpowers, perhaps a message to the current vice-president. The prevailing view among Chinese academics is that she will not stray too far from President Biden’s slow and steady diplomatic approach. But on the debate stage she went on the attack and accused Donald Trump of “selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernise their military”. Donald Trump has made it clear he plans has to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This will add to the tariffs he imposed as president which started a trade war in 2018. China retaliated, and numerous studies suggest this caused economic pain for both sides. This is the last thing China wants right now as it is trying to manufacture and export goods to rescue its economy. For Chinese leaders, this debate will have done little to assuage beliefs that Trump represents something else they don’t like - unpredictability. But in truth, there is little hope here that US policy on China will change significantly, no matter who sits in the White House. By Paul Adams, international correspondent, Jerusalem The two candidates did not stray much from their previously stated positions last night, even if Trump did add, with characteristic hyperbole, that Israel wouldn’t exist in two years if his opponent becomes president. Here in the Middle East, the race for the White House is being keenly watched. With the war in Gaza raging and a ceasefire deal still elusive, some of Benjamin Netanyahu’s critics suspect that Israel’s prime minister is deliberately stalling until after the election, in the hope that Trump will be more sympathetic to Israel than Harris. There’s a whiff of history perhaps being about to repeat itself. In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s campaign team was suspected of urging Iran not to release American hostages held in Tehran until after he had beaten President Jimmy Carter, saying Reagan would give Iran a better deal. Could something similar be afoot now? Certainly Netanyahu’s opponents believe he is now the chief obstacle to a ceasefire deal. Harris has indicated that she might be tougher on Israel than Joe Biden, something Trump has seized on, saying last night that the vice-president “hates Israel”. Palestinians, deeply sceptical about Donald Trump but dismayed by the Biden administration’s inability to stop the war in Gaza, are possibly inclined to see Harris as the lesser of two evils. They’ve long since abandoned any notion of the US as an honest broker in the Middle East, but will have noticed that Harris, unlike Trump, says she’s committed to Palestinian statehood. By Nick Thorpe, Central Europe correspondent, Budapest Donald Trump showered praise on the Hungarian prime minister. ""Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men, they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart..."" Hungarian pro-government media picked up on the compliment. ""Huge recognition!"" ran the headline in Magyar Nemzet. But government-critical news portal 444 quoted Tim Walz, running mate of Harris. ""He [Trump] was asked to name one world leader who was with him, and he said Orban. Dear God. That's all we need to know.’ Viktor Orban backed Trump for president in 2016 and is strongly backing him again in November.  The two men met for the second time this year at Trump’s home in Florida on 12 July, after Orban visited Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in quick succession. The Orban government is banking both on Trump’s victory and his ability to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. ""Things are changing. If Trump comes back, there will be peace. It will be established by him without the Europeans,"" Balazs Orban, Viktor Orban’s political director, told the BBC in July."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd13102l9g5o,Alex Salmond obituary: A man and a politician of contradictions,The 69-year old was first minister for seven years but resigned after losing the 2014 referendum.,2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:27:33.392356,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Alex Salmond was a man and a politician of extreme contradictions. A one-time radical firebrand, he moved his party from the political margins and perpetual opposition to government and the mainstream of Scottish public life.  He was a gambler and divider of opinions who became a rock-steady first minister with a mission to show voters that he could govern for all, using devolution to prove independence was nothing to be frightened of. And he was a powerful communicator who would see his reputation diminished amid allegations of sexual misconduct, a criminal trial and exile from the SNP. His death at the age of 69 brings to an end a remarkable life and political career and an important chapter in the story of the independence movement.  Salmond's reputation as a political heavyweight ensured he was a high-profile politician across the UK long before he won Holyrood's top job. In a BBC Scotland profile in 2011, former Conservative cabinet member Michael Portillo described him as the only Scottish politician to become well known in England and internationally while spending most of his career in Scottish politics.  ""I regard him as the outstanding politician not to have come out of Scotland, but to have remained in Scotland,"" he said. Born on Hogmanay 1954 in Linlithgow, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond grew up in a town soaked in Scottish history and tradition.  A talented boy soprano, he sang in St Michael's Parish Church. The 15th Century kirk, which stands next to Linlithgow Palace, was a place of royal worship and the site of Mary Queen of Scots' baptism. Salmond described his parents as working class nationalists with a small ‘n’. He was proud to have grown up in a council house, educated in Scotland's distinctly egalitarian school system built on the Kirk's traditions.  From there he made his way to the University of St Andrews, where he studied economics and medieval history and joined the SNP almost immediately after arriving there in 1973.  The party was just about to take off, achieving 30% of the vote and sending 11 MPs to Westminster in the election of October 1974.  A contemporary at St Andrews, future BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor, later remembered him as a ""mischief maker"" at St Andrews. ""If he had two options to make a political point, he would always use the one which allowed him to make mischief as well as making the point,"" he said. ""But he was also a brilliantly focussed politician. He was president of the Federation of Nationalist Students, and he was very focussed. He was easily the same quality as his political contemporaries such as Gordon Brown down in Edinburgh."" After university, the radical young political activist who wanted to bring about the end of the United Kingdom state then embarked on a career right at the heart of it. In 1978, he entered the Government Economic Service (GES) as an assistant economist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, part of the now defunct Scottish Office.  After two years later he moved to the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked for seven years as an economist, eventually coming to specialise in oil and gas. But all the while the world of politics was exerting its pull. An active member of the SNP, he played a prominent role in the party's dissident 79 Group.  They wanted to move the SNP to the left, seeking the support of working-class and disaffected Labour voters who were unhappy at the failure of their party to deliver the promised Scottish Assembly. The group was expelled from the party in 1982 but his colleagues saw Salmond as too talented to be left out in the cold and brought the trouble-makers back into the ranks.  By the late 1980s, as Thatcherism swept across Scotland and the country felt the full force of her economic policies on its industrial sector, Salmond was seen as a rising star and potential future leader.  Elected as MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987, he quickly made his mark by getting himself banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the chancellor's Budget speech in protest at the introduction of the community charge in Scotland. When the job of party leader came up in 1990, Salmond made his move and won, perhaps surprisingly repositioning the SNP as more centrist, socially democratic and pro-European. Throughout the 1990s, Salmond became a familiar figure on radio and television and a great favourite of the UK press. An effective political analyst and communicator, he derided the Thatcher and Major governments before turning his criticism on New Labour and Tony Blair. He also increased his command of the SNP. His grip over its senior members and processes was total.  He built close support from key comrades such as party chief executive Michael Russell and younger talents including Nicola Sturgeon, who would become his protege and eventual deputy. Salmond led the party into joining the ""Yes-Yes"" campaign for a Scottish parliament, arguing the ""gradualist"" rather than ""fundamentalist"" approach to gaining independence. The SNP came second at the inaugural Holyrood election in 1999 and Salmond appeared to enjoy the role of chief opposition leader. A witty and brilliant debater, he did not always show the best judgement. As Nato planes bombed Serbia in retaliation for its attacks on Kosovo, he opposed the conflict because it was not authorised by a United Nations Security Council resolution.  Salmond described the Nato action as ""an act of dubious legality, but, above all, one of unpardonable folly"" and was heavily criticised for his comments. In 2000, Salmond made the surprise decision to quit and stand down as both leader and MSP. He returned to Westminster, a move which underlined a common criticism that the man calling for Scotland's ""freedom"" was more at home in London. But he was also in demand as an acute critic of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the close personal and political relationship between UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush. Salmond was one of 11 MPs who attempted unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Blair. His actions, as well as his presence on marches and speeches at protests, made him a leading figure in the anti-war movement and won him many admirers. But his absence from Edinburgh during this period was not good for his party.  John Swinney had succeeded him as leader, but stood down in 2004 following a string of dismal election results, criticism from across his party and the negative publicity of a leadership challenge. As that summer progressed, there were persistent rumours that Salmond was considering a return. He responded by borrowing a line from General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: ""If nominated, I'll decline. If drafted, I'll defer. And if elected, I'll resign."" Always partial to a dramatic flourish, Salmond announced he had changed his mind just before nominations closed, having cut a deal with candidate Nicola Sturgeon which saw her agree to be his number two.  He told journalists he was not just launching a campaign to be SNP leader, but his ""candidacy to be first minister of Scotland"". He promised to unite what had become a fractious Scottish parliamentary party, and focus on winning the 2007 election. And that he did, by the narrowest of margins. He formed a minority government and relied on Green and Conservative support to get his manifesto through one vote at a time.  For the more radical elements of his party, this might have been seen as sleeping with the enemy. But Salmond recognised working across the chamber was both necessary and desirable.  He was comfortable in the role of first minister and went about government in a measured, positive way. There was less of the smart-Alex of old and it was clear he took the job seriously.  Salmond had been in the role for just over a month when Islamist terrorists rammed the front entrance of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport.  His handling of the crisis was met with acclaim and he worked closely with Gordon Brown's government in London.  But over the coming few years there would be clashes over the decision to release the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, and the handling of the financial crisis.  Salmond was accused of taking a ""cavalier"" approach to dealing with US tycoon Donald Trump's £1bn Scottish golf resort. An inquiry into the affair by Holyrood's local government committee raised concerns over the Scottish government's decision to call in the plans, following their rejection by Aberdeenshire Council, after ""two five-minute phone calls"". The probe concluded the decision, although unprecedented, was competent. It was a typical Salmond approach to problem-solving. In many ways, 2011 marked the high point of Salmond's political career. He pulled off what had always been descibed as the impossible - winning a majority at a Scottish parliamentary election. A triumphant SNP began planning for an independence referendum.  Over the course of the following three years, Salmond was credited with out-smarting Prime Minister David Cameron and his coalition government colleagues, winning crucial battles over the timing and structure of the vote and the wording of the question which would be put to voters. The official campaign was meant to take place in the autumn of 2014 but in reality the battle lasted the three-and-a-half years between election and referendum. Rival campaigns were meant to take the debate out of the politicians' hands but in the end it came down to Salmond trading blows with Labour's Alastair Darling in a series of televised debates. The FM was strong on rhetoric and vision, projecting an optimistic view of a future Scotland that could do anything it wanted; prosperous and fair, unshackled from the union with England but close to its European allies.  He was less sure on dealing with Scotland's structural deficit, what currency would be used and how state pensions would be funded and paid. In the end, the result was a ""No"" to independence. Salmond had failed. That he had led his side to a 45% share was a remarkable achievement that provided little succour. Within hours, he announced his resignation. Almost 60, it was time to hand over the fight to a younger generation. His close friend and loyal deputy Nicola Sturgeon was his chosen successor.  He chose to stand again for Westminster, winning Gordon as part of the SNP surge of 2015, when the party won 56 out 59 seats, significantly enhancing its power in the Commons. But it was short-lived. He lost the seat just two years later, bringing to an end a political career spread more than 30 years and two parliaments. The following years were sometimes awkward for his supporters and admirers.  His decision to host a chat show on RT, the former Russia Today channel editorially controlled by Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, was a source of criticism and embarrassment to his party.  That was suspended in February 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A year later a programme with the same format began broadcasting on Turkish public television. There was an Edinburgh Fringe chat show in 2017 which included a rather crude innuendo about Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and Melania Trump. It prompted his successor as leader, Nicola Sturgeon, to comment that: “Occasionally Alex is not as funny as he thinks he is."" It was a minor hint at tension between the two and the joke would look even more unfortunate in the light of what was to come later. In August 2018 the Daily Record newspaper revealed Salmond had been reported to police over sexual assault allegations dating back to his time as first minister. He denied the claims and said he was taking the Scottish government to court to challenge the complaints procedure which had been activated against him. A week later he resigned from the SNP after 45 years. He said he wanted to avoid internal division within the party, which was facing calls to suspend him. The subsequent parliamentary inquiry revealed that, in the nine or so months leading up to the initial story breaking, a complicated series of meetings and conversations had taken place between those at the top of the SNP and those at the top of the Scottish government, often confusing the division between the two. Mistakes in the complaints process were such that in January 2019 Salmond won a judicial review, ruling the investigation was unlawful, unfair and ""tainted by apparent bias"".  He was later awarded more than £500,000 in costs. That same month he appeared in court and was charged with 14 offences, including two counts of attempted rape. In 2020, after two weeks of evidence, he was acquitted of every charge. But the testimony was devastating for his public image.  Salmond's advocate, Gordon Jackson KC, admitted that his client had sometimes behaved badly, calling him ""touchy-feely"".  Details of inappropriate behaviour included Salmond admitting having a ""sleepy cuddle"" with one complainer, and what Mr Jackson called ""a bit of how's your father"" with another - both younger members of his staff, neither of them his wife. The KC said in his closing speech that the former first minister ""could certainly have been a better man"". There was also confirmation of what had long been whispered; that Salmond could bully colleagues and staff. Witnesses called him ""extraordinarily pugnacious"" and ""extremely demanding"". Two subsequent inquiries into the conduct of ministers and officials saw Salmond asserting his belief that many in his former party had colluded against him in an effort to block any final return to frontline politics. Yet there was to be a final return, as leader of the newly-formed Alba party. Launched just ahead of the 2021 Holyrood election, it attracted a few defections from his old party but never achieved more than 3% at the ballot box. Salmond never wavered from his belief that independence was necessary, desirable and inevitable for Scotland.  His enthusiasm for the cause did not extend to his former comrades in the campaign, however. He was often brutally critical of Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney, his one time proteges and friends who succeeded him into Bute House. Away from politics, Salmond was something of an enigma. He and wife Moira, who never had children, closely protected their private lives. He loved golf, football and horse racing and was said to be a keen reader. Love him or loathe him, few would dispute Alex Salmond's skill and achievements as a politician. He never achieved his dream of independence but as one of the most talented politicians of his generation, he took the SNP as close to its goal as it had ever been."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvglrrz95zzo,US imposes new sanctions on Russian state media,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the outlet RT of engaging in ""global covert activities"".",14 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:33.480728,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has announced new sanctions against the Russian media channel RT, accusing it of being a ""de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus"". The top US diplomat told reporters on Friday that RT is part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets which have sought to covertly ""undermine democracy in the United States"". He added that the Russian government has ""embedded within RT, a unit with cyber operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence"". RT live-streamed Mr Blinken's remarks on X and declared it the ""US's latest conspiracy theory"". Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said there should be a ""new profession"" in the US, of specialist in sanctions imposed on Russia. Responding to US allegations that RT had sought to influence elections, RT’s editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan who was sanctioned by the US last week said they were excellent teachers, adding that many RT staff had studied in the US, and with US funding. The State Department accused the state broadcaster, formerly Russia Today, of engaging in ""information operations, covert influence, and military procurement"" in countries in Europe, Africa, and North and South America. Mr Blinken also accused RT of running online fundraisers to purchase body armour, sniper rifles, drones and other equipment for Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. The network, he said, has also sought to influence Moldova's politics in coordination with Russian intelligence ahead of presidential elections in October 2024. The US had already indicted two RT employees for allegedly attempting to interfere in this year's presidential election, but US officials said on Friday the state broadcaster played a bigger role in Russia's efforts to undermine democracies.  The state-funded media organisation responded at the time by mocking the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"". ""Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections."" Mr Blinken said in a press conference: ""Our most powerful antidote to Russia's lies is the truth. It's shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness."" Mr Blinken emphasised that the sanctions were not related to the content of the outlet's reporting, and he affirmed the US's support for independent journalism. ""Covert influence activities are not journalism,"" he said. The announcement is part of a suite of actions the US government has taken against Russian state media as the 2024 election approaches. The State Department has also designated RT as a foreign mission."

The chiefs of MI6 and the CIA also said both countries stand together in ""resisting an assertive Russia and Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine"". In a first-ever joint article, Sir Richard Moore and William Burns wrote in the Financial Times that they saw the war in Ukraine coming ""and were able to warn the international community"", in part by declassifying secrets to help Kyiv. And they said there was work being done to ""disrupt the reckless campaign of sabotage"" across Europe by Russia, push for de-escalation in the Israel-Gaza war, and counterterrorism to thwart the resurgent Islamic State (IS). In the FT op-ed, they wrote: ""There is no question that the international world order – the balanced system that has led to relative peace and stability and delivered rising living standards, opportunities and prosperity – is under threat in a way we haven’t seen since the Cold War."" ""Successfully combating this risk"" is at the foundation of the special relationship between the UK and US, they added. One of the ""unprecedented array of threats"" faced by both countries is the war in Ukraine, which is in its third year after Russia's invasion in February 2022. The security services chiefs made their first public speaking appearance together at the FT Weekend Festival at London's Kenwood House on Saturday.  Details of the speakers were kept under wraps until just minutes before they arrived on stage. They appeared relaxed together and stressed the close working partnership between their agencies. Mr Burns told attendees that Ukraine's recent seizure of Russian territory in the Kursk region was a ""significant tactical victory"", but he saw no evidence that  Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power was weakening. There have been calls from Ukraine for the West to supply more weapons and lift restrictions on their use inside Russia.   The failure to do so has sometimes been put down to fears over how Moscow might react. But the spy chiefs suggested that should not deter support for Ukraine. ""None of us should take lightly the risks of escalation,"" Mr Burns said.  He described a moment in late 2022 when there was, he said, a ""genuine risk"" of the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia in response to setbacks on the battlefield.  Mr Burns passed messages to Russian officials warning of the consequences of their use. ""I’ve never thought, however - and this is the view of my agency - that we should be unnecessarily intimidated by that,"" the CIA Director continued.  ""Putin’s a bully. He’s going to continue to sabre rattle from time to time."" Asked about an apparent increased willingness of Russian intelligence services to carry out covert operations like sabotage and arson in Europe, Sir Richard Moore said their use of criminals to carry out attacks suggested a degree of desperation. ""Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral in some of their behaviour,"" he said.  Mr Burns added that even if plots sometimes appeared amateurish, they could still be ""reckless and dangerous"". In their joint piece for the FT newspaper, both men said ""staying the course is more vital than ever"" when it comes to supporting Ukraine, adding that Mr Putin ""will not succeed"". The conflict has shown how technology can alter the course of war, and highlighted the need to ""adapt, experiment and innovate"", they said. They continued: ""Beyond Ukraine, we continue to work together to disrupt the reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe being waged by Russian intelligence, and its cynical use of technology to spread lies and disinformation designed to drive wedges between us."" Both foreign intelligence services see the rise of China as the main intelligence and geopolitical challenge of the century.  They have reorganised their services ""to reflect that priority"", the pair wrote. They also said they have pushed ""hard"" for restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, and have been working ""ceaselessly"" to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. Mr Burns, who has been central to ceasefire efforts, indicated at the FT event that there may be a more detailed proposal in the coming days. ""This is ultimately a question of political will,"" he said, adding that he ""profoundly"" hopes leaders on both sides will do a deal. It is 11 months since Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then in Israel's ongoing military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq8ydy8e79o,Interest rates held at 5% but 'on the path down',Economists are betting on rates being held in September with a cut to come in November instead.,19 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:49.817795,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Interest rates are ""now gradually on the path down"", the Bank of England governor has said after borrowing costs were held at 5%. Andrew Bailey said inflation had ""come down a long way"" but warned the Bank would need to see more evidence that it will remain low before cutting rates further. The decision to hold rates comes as prices continue to rise slightly faster than the Bank's target, with inflation remaining at 2.2% last month. Experts are predicting the Bank will cut rates further in November. There are two more interest rates decisions this year. The decision to hold interest rates, which was widely expected, follows a cut from 5.25% in August  - the first reduction since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. ""I think interest rates are going to come down, I'm optimistic on that front,"" Mr Bailey said. But he said it was ""vital"" that inflation remains low. ""So we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much,” he added. The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and other lenders. The higher level has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns. Higher interest rates push mortgage rates up. This can result in landlords raising their rent to cover higher repayments.  Sofia and her husband James are among those affected. They moved with their one-year-old son to Berkshire after their rent went up by £100 a month to £1,650 in May 2024. They moved to a smaller terraced house where they are paying £1,400. They have a joint income of £54,000 and say they cannot save for a deposit to buy a house. ""When I went on maternity leave, I could only go off for about 10 weeks because we just couldn't afford any more. Even that was a major stretch to the point where we had to put ourselves into a bit of debt,"" Sofia said. She added food banks helped them and sometimes her husband had to work from home as he did not have the money to put fuel in the car. The Bank said the decision to hold this month was ""guided by the need to squeeze persistent inflationary pressures"" out of the UK economy. It expects inflation to rise to around 2.5% towards the end of this year, but it also suggested the country’s economic picture was improving. It said it had received reports of a ""improving real incomes"" and added mortgage approvals had increased to their highest level since September 2022 – the month of former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s infamous mini-Budget, which led to soaring mortgage rates. While the impact of two giant global shocks - the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine war - on consumer prices have died down, prices are still rising faster than the Bank's 2% target. Mr Bailey said the two inflation shocks had ""passed through"" the economy. He said: ""We've beaten the problem that…we saw in these huge global shocks. They appear to have left fewer...aftershocks behind them. Probably all of us feared they would. ""I think probably confidence is rising."" But the UK's economic recovery has been muted. The strong growth in the first half of the year has slowed, with consumers holding back due to high prices.  The Bank warned while there was ""improved sentiment and expectations"" of increased economic growth, it expected weaker expansion of 0.3% between July and September, down from 0.4%. The UK has had sluggish economic growth in recent years, something which the new Labour government has pledged it will change."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qg8d50z1zo,Families cling to hope in Belarus after first release of political prisoners,"Dozens of prisoners were freed unexpectedly this summer, now relatives are hoping more will follow.",12 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:49.917943,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Dmitry Luksha built up muscles breaking rocks in a Belarusian prison camp, put to work alongside men convicted of murder and drug smuggling. The journalist was imprisoned in 2022 and sentenced to four years for his reports on the mass opposition protests of 2020 and his country’s later complicity in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But he’s just been released early, one of several dozen political prisoners freed this summer in a series of surprise amnesties. It’s given hope to the relatives of others that further releases might follow. “One day they called me in, and a man from the prosecutor’s office just asked, ‘Do you want to go home?’,” Dmitry recalls, now in Poland with his wife, Polina. She’d been convicted as his ""accomplice"" and the couple were freed at the same time. Human rights organisation Viasna calculates that 78 political detainees have been given an amnesty so far in recent weeks. Many have serious medical conditions, but not all of them. The criteria for early release are unknown. Like everyone, Dmitry first had to request an official pardon from Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko. Four years ago, the authoritarian leader was almost forced from power by enormous street protests which were eventually crushed with police brutality and mass arrests – and with Russian political support. With another election due next year, perhaps as soon as February, it is possible Lukashenko is hoping for an image boost: state propaganda channels have been presenting the amnesties as a ""humane"" gesture by a ""wise"" leader. Dmitry Luksha isn’t sure of the true motive or why he was chosen: “Maybe those who started the process, the arrests, realise they went too far. I don’t know."" But he says “20-30%” of all inmates in the prisons where he was held were there for political reasons. They are marked by a yellow tag stitched to their chest so they are easy to spot. “It’s such a moment of joy to be home. Of euphoria. To hug our families and to breathe freely again,” Dmitry says. “The main thing is that this process is happening. And for it not to stop.” The unexpected releases have given hope to other prisoners’ families, including those of high-profile detainees like Maria Kolesnikova. “I believe this is a moment when Lukashenko started to send signals to the Western world that he will be ready, in the future, to negotiate on releases,” Maria’s sister Tatsiana Khomich argues. For her, the need is urgent. The conditions in which Maria is being held are “killing her slowly”, her sister warns. “I think any means [possible] should be used to help her. To save her. Because her situation is critical.” A classical flautist, Maria Kolesnikova helped lead the peaceful street protests in 2020, becoming hugely popular for her seemingly boundless energy and optimism. She was later sentenced to 11 years for ""conspiring to seize power"". In prison she had emergency surgery for a perforated ulcer and is since reported to have lost at least 20kg (three stone), and is now said to weigh only 45kg. She’s being denied extra parcels or cash for the special diet she needs. “Maria is starving in the colony. I believe she already passed a critical weight loss that endangers her life,” her sister worries. Tatsiana only gets snippets of information via other prisoners when they’re released, because since March 2023 Maria has been kept in punishment cells. She is held in isolation, with no calls, letters or visits. For months at a time, she can be denied even a half-hour daily walk around a tiny, covered prison yard. “We saw that the international community didn’t react in time in the case of Alexei Navalny,” says Tatsiana, remembering the Russian opposition activist who died suddenly in prison as talks over a possible deal to free him were under way. “They were too late and not very decisive.” In the end, a major prisoner exchange with Russia did take place – including some well-known Russian dissidents – and that gave Tatsiana some hope. “We saw that everything is possible. We saw that you can negotiate during a war, or a Cold War. You can negotiate with people you name terrorist, or dictator.” There are others who sense a moment of opportunity with the Belarusian leadership: signals that it is seeking to engage again with the outside world. “I think the Lukashenko regime is interested in avoiding becoming part of Russia. That’s why they want some communication with the West. That’s why they're releasing prisoners,” argues Ryhor Astapenia, a Chatham House analyst on Belarus based in Warsaw. Pushing for more, and more prominent prisoner releases might be one avenue to pursue, in any attempt to ""decouple"" Minsk from Moscow. But that very approach remains controversial, given Alexander Lukashenko’s crucial supporting role for Russia in the war on Ukraine. It’s also a strain to see the early releases as any real thaw, as the repression continues. Ryhor Astapenia himself was recently sentenced in absentia to 10 years, along with other academics and analysts, for a supposed plot against the government. After imprisoning political activists and journalists in Belarus, prosecutors had turned their attention to those who criticise the country abroad. “They do it because they can,” he shrugs. “They see no reason to stop.” It was two years after the mass protests of 2020 that the police turned up for Dmitry Luksha. By then, he had imagined he was safe. “Those two years were my undoing,” he knows now, having spent 28 tough months in jail. When he was released, unexpectedly, he thought he would stay in Belarus. But that was impossible. “I would jump whenever the lift opened. Or when a minibus with tinted windows pulled up. And there were so many armed police in the street,” Dmitry explains, from the safety of Warsaw where tens of thousands of other Belarusians now live, for the same reasons. “You understand that you’ve done nothing wrong, they shouldn’t be coming for you. But you can’t tell your heart that. It’s the brutal Belarus of today, and your heart is afraid.” That’s why Dmitry hopes the amnesties will continue, whatever is driving the process: Viasna still lists 1,349 political prisoners in Belarus. “I really hope the numbers released will grow, so that those with long sentences also get out. Those people live in hope that someone will come and tell them: it’s your turn. I really hope they do.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx29z3v919xo,Inside Pokrovsk - the vital Ukrainian town in Russia's sights,"If invading Russians seize this vital transport hub, Ukraine could lose the entire Donetsk region.",9 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:50.008052,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Fleeing the town she has lived in most of her life, Maria Honcharenko is taking just one small bag, and her two tiny kittens. After stubbornly staying on in the east Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, the 69-year-old is now heeding advice and preparing to leave. “My heart stops when I hear a bang,” she tells me, crying. She’s holding an old push-button phone where emergency contacts are saved. The front line is less than 8km (4.9 miles) from Pokrovsk. Serhiy Dobryak, the head of the city’s military administration, says that Russians target the city not just with ballistic missiles and multiple rocket launchers - they also now strike with guided bombs and even artillery, as the city is now within the range of those weapons too. “Look what Russians did to us. I worked here for 30 years and now I am leaving everything behind,” she says, breaking down in tears. Volunteers help Ms Honcharenko to get on an evacuation bus. Trains no longer run here. Pokrovsk is a key transportation hub. If it falls, then Russian forces will cut off one of the main supply routes in the region. This will likely force Ukraine to retreat from Chasiv Yar and the front line will move closer to Kramatorsk. For Ukraine, this would effectively mean the loss of almost the entire Donetsk region, which the Kremlin has fought to capture since the beginning of their invasion. The Ukrainian military admits that its incursion into Russia’s Kursk region failed to force Moscow to divert its troops from eastern Ukraine.   And some observers argue that this move, which certainly helped to boost morale among the soldiers, left the strategic supply route vulnerable to Russian attacks. On Sunday, Russia claimed to have taken control of the village of Novohrodivka, just 10km from Pokrovsk. Kyiv has not commented but sources told the BBC that Ukrainian forces have retreated from there. The space on the evacuation bus quickly fills up. A woman with a five-year old daughter climbs on board. This is their second evacuation. The first time it was in 2022 when they fled from a border town after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This city is clearly Moscow’s top priority. According to Serhiy Dobryak, the head of Pokrovsk’s military administration, the ratio of forces fighting in that direction is 10 to one in Russia’s favour. During its latest attack, Russia hit a substation in Pokrovsk, leaving half the city without power. The strikes also disrupted water supplies. The city is quickly becoming deserted. Just two months ago, 48,000 people were still living here. Today half of them have already left. The bustling downtown with shops and supermarkets is eerily quiet. Banks, supermarkets and most cafes are closed. The hospital has been evacuated. Outside the city, excavators are digging new trenches in the fields. However, Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief says that the army has managed to stop the Russian advancement towards Pokrovsk. Lt Col Oleh Demyanenko, a battalion commander of the 110th brigade, told the BBC that the front line on the northern flank of Russia’s assault on Pokrovsk had indeed been stabilised. However, Russian attacks are mostly focused on the southern flank, he says, where heavy battles are continuing. One of the areas on that flank that Russians are trying to seize is Selidove, a small town south-east of Pokrovsk. The BBC visited an artillery position of the 15th Brigade of the National Guard that defend this town. Relentless Russian attacks give them no respite. “Prepare for action!” the unit commander Dmytro orders after receiving coordinates of a new target. All crew members rush to an old American M-101 howitzer. This type of gun was used in World War Two. Now Ukrainians fire it to stop Russian attacks. The commander shouts “Fire!” and pulls the rope. The explosion is deafening. The gun is covered with smoke. The fighting in his sector is very intense, says 31-year-old Dmytro. “The enemy attacks in groups of up to 15 people, sometimes up to 60,” he said. “We fire up to 200 rounds a day [to repel them].” This is a big change to last winter when big guns stayed silent for most of the day. But the more they shell the Russian positions, the greater the risk of return fire. So, after each series of rounds, they head to a dugout to wait out Russia’s counter barrage. And when they hear a loud thud in the distance, they go quiet. “A glide bomb,” one of the soldiers mutters. It’s this weapon that they fear the most. It has a devastating effect and the gunners have nowhere to hide from it. Dmytro gives an evasive answer when asked whether it would be more useful to use Ukrainian forces involved in the Kursk operation to defend the Donbas region instead. “Commanders have a better view to make strategic decisions,” he said. The front line here can move quickly. Sometimes it can be a total surprise for Ukrainian forces. Last month, a group of seven soldiers of the 68th Brigade started their shift at the forward position in the village of Komyshivka, 15km west of Selidove. Their task was to stop any attempts of Russian forces to break through. The next day, however, they were encircled by the Russian forces. Thanks to extremely brave drivers and the negligence of Russian soldiers, they were evacuated three days later. Back in Pokrovsk, the evacuation bus with Ms Honcharenko on board is full. They have to take a new route as the bridge on the way out of town is damaged by the Russian strikes. As the bus starts moving, people wave through the windows and wipe their tears away. For Maria Honcharenko, this is a scary journey full of uncertainties. But she knows one thing – it will be safer in her new home than remaining at the front line."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ng0nyj2no,Rise of far right in Germany’s east isn’t over yet,"AfD support continues to rise in Germany, driven by anger over immigration and weapons for Ukraine.",8 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:50.106791,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“If the old parties had done their jobs properly then the AfD would not exist,” Ingolf complains, echoing a common sense that the rest of Germany looks down on so-called “Ossis” in the east. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have already won the most votes in regional elections this month in the eastern state of Thuringia. Now Germany’s bracing for a further political shockwave, as polls suggest the AfD could also take the most votes in Brandenburg state's election in a few weeks time. Tucked away near the Polish border, in the two tiny villages of Jämlitz and Klein Düben, support for the far right has soared. A former conservative (CDU) voter, Ingolf is frustrated about how successive governments have handled education, saying standards were better when he was a boy growing up in the communist German Democratic Republic. He voices anxiety about Germany’s flatlining economy as well as immigration, comparing the far-right riots in England this summer to “civil war-like conditions”. Disorder that, while nothing like a civil war, has stoked narratives about the potential for violent clashes within multicultural communities. “That’s not what we want here in Germany,” he says. In Jämlitz, most notable for a large goose farm, the idea of civil strife couldn’t feel further away. Nor could the war raging in Ukraine. But the AfD’s call to stop sending weapons to Kyiv is also resonating strongly. “The money for Ukraine is an issue,” says Yvonne, who sees all war as “senseless” as we chat to her just down the road. “And this is our tax money that is sent abroad. We have enough things to fix in our own country.” However, Yvonne is leaning towards another anti-establishment party launched only this year that also opposes supplying arms to Ukraine and which is a surging force in German politics: the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). Ms Wagenknecht’s personal brand of “left-wing conservatism” has already propelled her party this month into the potential role of kingmaker in Saxony and Thuringia. However, for her critics, she has simply fashioned another unwelcome populist, pro-Putin movement that’s actively undermining central pillars of German foreign policy. I challenge Yvonne about the idea of ending arms supplies to Ukraine, which could help Russia win a war it began, by invading its neighbour. “I can understand both sides,” she says after a little hesitation. This is the part of Germany where the older generation, from the GDR years, grew up learning Russian language and culture. It’s also a country, scarred by two World Wars, that retains a strong pacifist streak fed by fears the existing conflict could escalate. “Poland is not big,” Yvonne says, as she points out the Polish border is only a few miles away. “And we are then the first ones to go when the tanks come across.” In these two villages, that have a population of under 500 people, 57.5% of voters backed the far-right party in a recent local council election, the largest proportion in Brandenburg. Across the wider district, that number was 43.7%, also unusually high.  It comes ahead of a larger, state-parliament level vote on 22 September, where the AfD is leading the polls – after they already won the most votes in Thuringia and came a close second in Saxony on 1 September. In Thuringia, the AfD attracted 36% of the under-30s vote, say election researchers. Their relative strength in the east is despite the fact the party is viewed by many – and officially classed in three states – as right-wing extremist, a charge its supporters avidly reject. Even if the AfD does well in Brandenburg it likely won’t take power because – as elsewhere – other parties refuse to work with it. Not far away, I visit one of the beautiful lakes that have been transformed from their original purpose as open cast coal mines. As I wander around asking people if they want to talk about German politics, most, perhaps unsurprisingly, are not all that tempted. A woman called Katrin does agree to speak, although she doesn’t want her picture taken. Ushering us away from a small crowd sunbathing on the grass and a little beach, she lights a cigarette and is watchful as we wait to hear what she has to say. It feels like it’s going to be really controversial. She doesn’t like the AfD – something that can feel like a rogue opinion around here. “Half the people here didn’t vote for the AfD,” she reminds us, adding she is “devastated” by local levels of support for a far-right party. But why are they so popular, I ask? “That’s a good question,” says Katrin. “That’s what I ask myself all the time.” “There is an old saying,” she recalls. “If a donkey is too comfortable it goes on black ice.” Katrin is saying that she believes life, actually, is relatively good for people in the community, leading to a misguided “grass-is-greener” syndrome - whether that’s with an eye on the past or present. Average wage levels and household wealth are lower in the east when compared to the west, although inequalities have narrowed through the years. Overall, Katrin doesn’t understand it. “I’m still thinking myself, why, why, why?” You get the feeling that mainstream parties, including those in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, are similarly unable to quite comprehend, or respond, to the success of either the AfD or BSW, parties polling nationally at about 18% and 8% respectively. The traditional parties of power are casting a nervous eye to the east and the Germany’s reputation for relatively calm, consensus politics is under strain."

Dorset Museum in Dorchester offered the opportunity to wander through its galleries naked on Tuesday evening. The ticket price for the event, organised by British Naturism, included a glass of wine, changing facilities and a locker for clothes. Museum Director Claire Dixon said it ""showcased the ways museums can provide for their communities"". In what is thought to be the first event of its kind at a UK museum, 65 people were given a private tour of the museum after it had closed to the public. Fiona Discombe, who attended with her husband Michael, said ""This is an event we really wanted to come to as it's different.  ""Obviously you're sharing an experience with like-minded people, it's great fun.""  Keith Bowman, from the Dorset branch of British Naturism, said he was ""relieved"" to have sold more tickets than anticipated.  ""My remit is to try and find new venues,"" he said.  ""I write to a lot of venues asking if they would entertain such a visit and Dorset Museum responded very quickly."" Dorset Museum & Art Gallery in Dorchester's High East Street reopened in 2021 after a £16.4m revamp lasting more than two years. Collections include the story of palaeontologist Mary Anning, the archive of novelist Thomas Hardy and works by sculptor Elisabeth Frink, along with 250 million years of natural history. In January, the museum said Covid-19, the cost of living crisis, Brexit and the war in Ukraine had affected visitor growth while costs had also risen. Ms Dixon said the idea for the event came about after she publicly warned the venue was struggling and needed new ways to boost funds and visitor numbers. ""I received an overwhelming response,"" she continued. ""A lot of people got in touch with ideas and suggestions for ways they could help. ""For us it's fantastic as it enables us to showcase the many ways you can see a museum and the fact that we're here for everybody."" You can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l1qd1nwnjo,"Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues, from tax to Israel","From abortion to trade, here are his policy pledges as he runs for the White House for a third time.",11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:27:50.278693,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president for the third consecutive election.  When he was defeated by Joe Biden after his first term in office, the country was in the midst of Covid, lockdowns and social unrest.  It followed a campaign in which restoring both economic health and law and order were his central messages. Here are his policy pledges this time. This is the biggest issue for voters and it’s the pinch of high food and housing costs that seems to be shaping their sentiment rather than the robust growth and low unemployment. Inflation has fallen steeply from a 40-year high in 2022, but the former New York businessman has retained a persistent polling advantage on the economy over his Democratic opponents. One of the 20 core promises on his campaign website is to “end inflation and make America affordable again”. A president’s power to lower prices directly is very limited. Trump has pledged to expand US energy production, opening areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs, though analysts are sceptical. He says he can reduce housing costs by preventing some undocumented immigrants from getting mortgages and deporting others, and by launching a home building programme on federal land. Trump has a raft of tax cuts planned. Firstly, he wants to extend the cuts he enacted in 2017, which are due to expire next year. That was the biggest tax overhaul in decades, aimed at simplifying the tax code and promoting growth and investment. The largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse. The Republican also wants to shave a further percentage point off corporation tax - and has floated an even bigger cut to 15%. He has proposed making tipped income tax free, a proposal that his opponent Kamala Harris subsequently backed, too. Trump has also called on abolishing the tax on Social Security payments, a move that would be welcomed by retired Americans but would at the same time punch a big hole in the fund. The former president brought the era of US free trade to a juddering halt when he became president, but his tariffs on Chinese imports were largely retained and even expanded by Joe Biden. This time around he has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods with imports from China bearing the brunt at 60%. It is part of his attempt to promote homegrown manufacturers and stop outsourcing, but some economists have warned this could push up prices for consumers. During the presidential debate with Harris, Trump pointed out he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and that the Biden administration has not removed them. This tops his list of priorities as it did in 2016 when “Build the wall” was his signature slogan. The number of border crossings hit record levels at the end of 2023, but has fallen this election year. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the wall and increasing enforcement. He has also promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history. His vice-president pick, JD Vance, said they would start by removing a million people, but experts told the BBC that deportations on that scale would face huge legal and logistical challenges. There are also claims it could slow economic growth. Children of undocumented residents would no longer be eligible for citizenship under another Trump policy, although this would face significant legal obstacles. This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, and Trump has struggled to find a consistent message. The three judges he appointed while president were pivotal in the landmark decision, which Democrats have used to rally supporters as abortion restrictions have been introduced in numerous states. Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion. But in recent weeks he has tried to walk a tightrope, taking a more moderate stance while trying not to alienate his conservative base. He criticised Florida’s six-week ban, provoking an angry backlash, but also said he would oppose a ballot measure in the state establishing the right to an abortion. During the presidential debate he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law. The Republican has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. ""I know Zelensky very well, and I know Putin very well,"" he said during the presidential debate. ""I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal."" Trump gave no details on what he thinks each side should give up in such a deal, and the Kremlin has said nothing can be done in 24 hours. Trump has also said he would stop the cash flowing to Ukraine. Mr Biden signed off $61bn in military aid for Ukraine in April. On Nato, he thinks countries that fall short of the advisory 2% of GDP spent on defence should forego the protection that comes with membership. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel and condemned pro-Palestinian supporters on US college campuses. But he has also at times been critical of the way Israel has conducted the war. He has said the war would not have happened if he had been president but offered no details on how he would end it. As president he angered Palestinians by moving the embassy to Jerusalem and his administration stopped calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which contravene international law, illegal. In his top 20 priorities, Trump promises not to cut Medicare, which is federally provided health insurance for older people. While president he tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the signature legislation of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people. He still criticises the law, which remains popular, but in March he said on Truth Social he would not undermine it. Recently he called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but it's unclear if such a large expense has the support of Republicans in Congress. He has pledged to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. His Republican policy platform vows to restore safety in neighbourhoods by replenishing police departments and protecting officers from “frivolous lawsuits”. Democrats point to his promise to pardon hundreds of convicted January 6 rioters as contradictory to his law-and-order stance. They also point to the fact violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and murders down by 13%, according to FBI data. As president, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, and protections for federal waterways.

Julian Gao, Ruby Hamill, Daniel Jones and Sayed Shah were arrested after staging a protest at the Teledyne factory in Shipley, which specialises in supplying electronics to the aerospace and defence sectors. Following the incident all four were charged with causing criminal damage and having articles with intent to destroy or damage property. However, after a trial at Bradford Crown Court the jury failed to reach verdicts on any of the charges. All four defendants will face a re-trial at the same court in February 2026. At the start of the trial the jury was shown CCTV footage of the group using an angle-grinder to cut through a security fence in the early hours of 2 April. The group was filmed carrying items including sledgehammers, crowbars, ladders and flags and staging a protest on the roof of the premises. The three men and a woman, who were wearing red boiler suits, were then captured on drone footage smashing roof tiles and windows. When police officers arrived they challenged the group on the roof and were told they were protesting at the site due to the war in Gaza, the court heard. Prosecutor Gerald Hendron told the court the total damage caused externally and internally to the premises had been £571,383. Teledyne Space and Defence Ltd supplies the defence and aerospace industry. Mr Hendron said components were used in the manufacture of weapons used by the British Army and NATO, as well as weapons purchased by other countries such as Ukraine and Israel. On Friday, after about seven hours of deliberation over two days, Judge Sophie McKone asked the jury if they would be able to reach verdicts if they were given more time. When the forewoman indicated they would not, the judge thanked them for their attention during the trial and formally discharged them. Mr Gao, 20, of Dalton Ellis Hall, Manchester, Mr Shah, 51, of Reedley Road, Burnley, Mr Jones, 30, of Rossett Road, Crosby, and 20-year-old Ms Hamill, of Emu Road, London, have all been bailed ahead of their next appearance.

Prince William, who attended his own ceremony for flying training at RAF College Cranwell in 2008, stood in for the King on Thursday as reviewing officer at the Sovereign's Parade. Receiving a royal salute and a flypast on arrival at the Lincolnshire base, the prince inspected the front rank of the Guard, presented awards, delivered a speech and spoke to the graduates and their families. The 48 graduates have had up to 24 weeks of intensive training to equip them with the skills needed for the RAF. The parade included graduates from both the Commissioned Warrant Officers Course and the Modular Initial Officer Training Course. Four international officer cadets – from Jordan, Kenya, Pakistan and Uganda – were also at the passing-out parade. During the speech, Prince William said: ""It is my great honour to be with you today representing my father, His Majesty the King. ""Whilst I didn’t graduate on this exact parade ground, I did graduate from flying training here, so I know something about the celebrations that will come later."" He added: ""This parade marks the culmination of many months of hard work and determination. ""I hope you’re all very proud of what you’ve achieved."" Pilot Officer Alexandra Manser-Jeffery said: ""The Prince of Wales, himself an air force pilot, knows what we're about to go and face. ""He's been through the training himself and was here for his flying training. For him to come today was a real honour.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj9n3rl794o,GB Energy: What does it mean for Scotland?,The prime minister has confirmed the state-owned energy company is coming to Aberdeen but many questions remain.,24 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:04.516754,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The UK government has confirmed that Aberdeen is to be the home of the new state-owned energy company. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has told the Labour conference in Liverpool that Great British Energy will operate out of the city. It will not supply power to homes, but will help fund new and existing clean technology, as well as small and medium-sized renewable energy projects. The government had been criticised for delays in announcing the company would be headquartered in Aberdeen but Sir Keir said it would be led by the ""talent and skills of the working people in the Granite City"". Great British Energy was one of Labour’s key election pledges and was always planned to be based in Scotland. BBC Scotland news revealed earlier this month that the decision had been taken to base the company in the UK's oil and gas capital. The company chairman, Juergen Maier, has now confirmed it will also operate sites in Glasgow and Edinburgh. But there has been some confusion over what exactly it was designed to do, which forced Labour to clarify its role during the election campaign. Tuesday's announcement means industry and consumers are a step closer to knowing what its creation will mean for the UK's energy future.  Ed Miliband, the UK's energy security and net zero secretary, has said the company will help ""to make Britain a clean-energy superpower, with a fully decarbonised power system by 2030."" He describes GB Energy as ""a new national champion allowing us to reap the benefits of Britain’s abundant natural resources, with clean power projects in communities across our country, to create the next generation of good jobs, reindustrialising Britain."" The government has published five key functions for the company: Its founding statement says: ""Great British Energy will own, manage and operate clean power projects. It will be a company that will generate energy in its own right, working in partnership with the private sector for the good of the country."" GB Energy has launched a partnership with The Crown Estate, the statutory corporation which runs the £16bn portfolio of land and seabed belonging to the monarch. The government believes this will cut through the long time-scales currently experienced when trying to get large infrastructure projects such as wind farms and transmission lines built. The Crown Estate estimates this partnership will lead to up to 20-30GW of new offshore wind developments reaching seabed lease stage by 2030, which it says is enough to power the equivalent of almost 20 million homes. Ministers also claim the deal ""has the potential to leverage up to £60bn of private investment into the UK’s drive for energy independence."" The government has pledged to invest £8.3bn of new money into the company over the course of this parliament. That is expected to be raised through a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. The party had said previously it would not issue new oil and gas licences but also said it would not overturn existing permits. The company will be independently operated and any profits will be reinvested, meaning it will be self-funding as soon as is possible. The confirmation that Aberdeen was to be the home of GB Energy came wrapped in praise from the prime minister at his speech in Liverpool. ""We said, GB Energy, our publicly owned national champion, the vehicle that will drive forward our mission on clean energy, we said it belonged in Scotland, and it does,"" he said. ""But the truth is, it could only really ever be based in one place in Scotland. ""So today, I can confirm that the future of British energy will be powered as it has been for decades, by the talent and skills of the working people in the Granite City with GB Energy based in Aberdeen."" That brings to an end months of speculation though the debate will now turn to what that will actually mean for jobs and infrastructre in the city, which faces a tricky transition from oil and gas to renewable energy. The SNP and Conservatives have claimed that up to 100,000 jobs could be at threat from Labour policy on oil and gas licences. However, the industry estimates the total Scottish jobs dependent on the sector is 60,000. Tuesday's announcement brought no further details on how many jobs would be created by GB Energy. Russell Borthwick, chief executive at Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said it would secure the north-east's status as a ""global energy capital"" for many decades to come. “We are home to over 1,000 energy supply chain companies and the lion’s share of energy workers who stand ready to deliver the UK’s transition to net zero,"" he said. “With the people, skills, strategic infrastructure and future pipeline of projects already in place, the north-east of Scotland is ready to lead the way. “However, we do not need to kill off one industry to grow another – in fact, the opposite is true, as one cannot exist without the other."" “We therefore urge the UK government to use next month’s Budget to restore confidence in the North Sea to protect the jobs, supply chain and energy production we need to ensure a just transition.” However, Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman said there were still more questions than answers. ""GB Energy should be an organisation that resources the energy sector’s move towards genuine renewable energy, not an excuse for more warm words on oil, gas and nuclear,"" she said. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the prime minister needed to ""get down to the business of explaining how GB Energy will bring down energy bills"". Scottish Conservative MSP Douglas Lumsden said the announcement would do ""almost nothing to compensate for the hammer blow Labour’s policies on oil and gas have already delivered to the north east"". GB Energy will not immediately cut bills for consumers, as the global energy market continues to deal with the problems caused by the war in Ukraine. The decision to restrict winter fuel allowance makes this a tricky area for Labour. But ministers are keen to stress this is the first part of changing the way Britain sources, manages and modernises its energy sector. To work, GB Energy will have to transition the oil and gas sector to renewables, redesign how the grid operates, deliver green energy directly into homes and end the UK's reliance on foreign energy. Ed Miliband has said: ""In an unstable world, the only way to guarantee our energy security and protect billpayers permanently is to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels and towards home‑grown clean energy."" Gas and electricity prices will rise by 10% in England, Scotland and Wales from October. Under the new energy price cap, the typical annual dual-fuel bill paid by direct debit will be £1,717 per year. At the same time, more then 10 million pensioners will no longer get winter fuel payments to help them with bills at the coldest time of year."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e1zlpxvw7o,'The lights go out when it rains' - hundreds of schools waiting on builders,"Just 62 of 513 schools selected for rebuilds in England have construction contracts, the BBC has found.",2 days ago,2024-10-14 18:28:04.694781,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Hundreds of old and leaky school buildings in England still don’t have builders assigned to them - even though they’re on a flagship government rebuilding programme, the BBC has found. More than 500 schools are on the scheme, but by this summer contracts had been awarded to construction companies to rebuild just 62 of them. The BBC has been looking into why targets are being missed. Industry experts have told us construction companies are nervous about taking on contracts in case costs exceed their budgets. But the Department for Education (DfE) says the programme is on track and forecasts were made before high inflation hit the construction industry. The School Rebuilding Programme, announced in 2020, aims to rebuild or refurbish about 500 schools in a decade.  Construction was due to start in 2021 at a rate of about 50 schools per year. However, according to the National Audit Office (NAO), the DfE forecast last year that it would complete fewer projects than it had initially planned. The BBC has found 23 schools have been completed so far and a further 490 are still waiting. Most do not yet have builders on board. The DfE originally projected that 83 contracts would be awarded by March 2023. However, its response to a BBC Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed only 62 had been issued by June 2024.  Patchway Community School in Bristol was selected for the School Rebuilding Programme in 2021, but is still waiting to be assigned a construction company. ""Sometimes when it's raining, the light malfunctions and you can barely see anything,"" said Year 8 student Faizah. ""When we play games like dodgeball or basketball, some of the balls get stuck up in the roof because of the holes,"" said Logan, also in Year 8. Dave Baker, the chief executive officer of The Olympus Academy Trust, which runs Patchway, said the cracked ceiling in the school gym, like other areas of wear and tear, was ""not worth replacing, because the whole thing is going to be knocked down within the next two years"".  He said the rebuilding process had been delayed by at least a year, after a company that had signed up to rebuild Patchway pulled out. ""The contractors, it seems, felt that they couldn't deliver the building to the specification for the money that was available. That's our interpretation of what happened,"" he said. ""I feel that there are young people and their families who have been let down - and that’s not OK."" Mr Baker now hopes to have a new contract in place in the coming weeks, and a new school with ""the best facilities in the area"" in 2027. Building company Wates told the BBC it worked ""extensively"" with the DfE and had provided design services for Patchway, but the DfE ""decided on this occasion not to proceed with Wates for the building work"". Rebecca Larkin, from the Construction Products Association, which represents manufacturers, said while a lag between the announcement of the School Rebuilding Programme and getting spades in the ground was to be expected, it was still running behind. ""It is not coming through as quickly or on the schedule that was originally promised by the government,"" she said, adding that she would have expected about 100 contracts to have been awarded by now. Ms Larkin said high inflation may have made building companies ""reticent"" to take on contracts.  ""Construction contractors typically operate on very small margins, so if they sign up to a contract and then prices rise during the construction work, there is very little room for manoeuvre,"" she said. ""Given that there are fixed capital budgets in all government departments, there is very little room for them to manoeuvre as well, so you're in a kind of Catch-22 situation."" Ms Larkin said updates on the programme were ""very infrequent"". Extra funding would help, she said, but the DfE was competing with other government departments for bigger budgets.  Others told the BBC the recent collapse of construction company ISG, which had already started work on at least one school on the School Rebuilding Programme, could make it even harder for the DfE to find companies to take on the work. The schools on the School Rebuilding Programme are those the DfE has deemed as being most in need. However, the NAO report last year said funding levels in England had contributed to the ""deterioration"" of the wider school estate - and 24,000 school buildings (38% of the total) were beyond their initial life design.  James Ludlow, principal at Joseph Leckie Academy in Walsall, said he spent £10,000 of the school's budget refurbishing its 1930s school hall this summer because he became ""fed up"" with the peeling paint and damp. ""We're having to spend a lot of money on patching things up,"" he said. The NAO report also said the ""slower than planned"" progress of the School Rebuilding Programme was ""largely due to construction providers not taking up contracts"". It said the DfE had ""taken steps to address these issues, including by changing its approach to project funding policy to reflect market conditions"". The DfE told the BBC the programme was on track, and its original forecasts were made before events including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine affected industry prices. It said schools take an average of two to five years to build, and that some form of work had started at just under half of the projects - although it did not specify what type of work. In a statement, education minister Stephen Morgan said the government ""inherited a school estate in need of urgent repair... and without a comprehensive plan"" - and that this would ""not be a quick fix"".

The Times quotes some of a statement he made on X - before President Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer's meeting in Washington - expressing what it describes as his ""frustration"" at the time it's taking them to make a decision. The Mail says he is accusing the west of ""dithering"", while Russian forces burn down cities and villages in Ukraine. The Guardian reports that the Ormiston Academies Trust will become the first in England to phase out access to smartphones for pupils at all of its 44 state schools. The paper quotes the Trust's chief executive Tom Rees as saying that schools have a ""responsibility"" to make it harder for children to access inappropriate content through the school day and to restrict ""the draw of social media.” The Telegraph's lead features detail from the autobiography of Sir Graham Brady, the former chairman of the Conservative 1922 committee, which runs the selection process for new Tory leaders.  He oversaw the departure of five prime ministers during his 14 year tenure. The paper says his book, Kingmaker,  details his private conversations with them as they were being forced from power. The Telegraph says the book also reveals that Rishi Sunak was not facing a confidence vote when he called the election; that Lord Cameron and George Osborne had contempt for people who did not share their backgrounds; and that Boris Johnson was fed up with backbenchers criticising his adviser Dominic Cummings during the pandemic. A Tear for Sven is the headline in the Mirror. It carries photos of the funeral of the former England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson, where an emotional David Beckham was among the mourners yesterday in Sweden. The pictures show him wiping his eyes, laying a hand on the coffin of his former boss and comforting Mr Eriksson's former partner Nancy Dell'Olio. The paper says the celebrations of his life included a New Orleans-style procession with a brass band. The i paper reports that more of us are using private healthcare than ever before because of the length of NHS waiting lists, with the number of admissions to private hospitals hitting a record high so far this year. But as a result, it claims, insurers are ""cashing in"" by raising prices.  It says that chemotherapy is among the most ""in-demand"" services that people are paying for, and that cataract surgery, colonoscopies and hip replacements are in the top five. Drinking water has little or no effect on your ability to cope with a hangover, according to the Mail. It says scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands have looked at three different studies, involving hundreds of party-going students, and recorded the hangover symptoms of those who drank water before going to bed, and those who didn't. The results, published in the journal Alcohol, showed that while those who drank water felt less dehydrated, they still had the same degree of nausea, exhaustion and pain as the students who skipped it.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c624ppg14jpo,Black rights activists convicted over Russian links,Florida jury found four defendants guilty of conspiring to act as Russian agents but cleared them of actually doing so.,13 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:04.891158,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Four activists for black rights have been convicted of federal charges of conspiring to act as unregistered Russian agents, the Justice Department said. Omali Yeshitela, 82, Penny Hess, 78, Jesse Nevel, 34, and Augustus Romain, 38, face maximum sentences of five years in prison, the department said in a statement. A jury in Tampa, Florida found them not guilty of the more serious charge of acting as agents of a foreign government. Yeshitela is the founder of the African People's Socialist Party (APSP) and Uhuru Movement. Hess and Nevel are white allies of the groups. Romain is the leader of a Georgia-based spinoff known as Black Hammer. A date has not yet been set for sentencing. According to prosecutors, the four carried out a number of actions in the US between 2015 and 2022 on behalf of the Russian government and received money and support from Aleksandr Ionov, the president of the Moscow-based group Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia. Mr Ionov used the APSP, Uhuru Movement and Black Hammer to promote Russian views on politics, the Ukraine war and other issues, they said. ""Ionov's influence efforts were directed and supervised"" by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the country's intelligence agency, the Justice Department said. Mr Ionov and two alleged FSB agents - Aleksey Borisovich Sukhodolov and Yegor Sergeyevich Popov - have also been indicted in the US in connection with the case but are not under arrest. The Justice Department said the Americans all knew Mr Ionov worked for the Russian government. Among the actions cited by prosecutors was the drafting by APSP in 2015 of a petition to the UN accusing the US of committing genocide against African people. Mr Ionov also allegedly sought to influence the 2017 mayoral election in St Petersburg, Florida, in which Nevel unsuccessfully ran for office. Leonard Goodman, a lawyer for Hess, told the Tampa Bay Times that the four had been prosecuted to censor their pro-Russian views. ""This case has always been about free speech,"" he told the AFP news agency.

The Daily Telegraph has a photo of a heavily tattooed offender, giving the thumbs-up as he was freed from Durham jail.  ""Cheers, Keir"" is the headline.  The paper's cartoonist, Matt, addresses concerns about rehabilitation.  He depicts inmates leaving a prison under a sign saying: ""Thank you for staying. See you again soon."" There is a picture on the front of the Daily Mail of a prisoner at Nottingham jail being sprayed with champagne - described in the caption as ""sickening celebrations"".  The Mail lists other incidents it is outraged by, including one offender being ""greeted by friends in a Lamborghini"", and another vowing he's now a ""life-long Labour voter"". The Sun dismisses the release scheme as a ""day of shame for the justice system"".  But its opinion column acknowledges that the circumstances which have led to it are ""not all the new government's fault"".  It points out that the overcrowding ""dates back at least to Tony Blair's era"". The i concentrates on the Commons vote on government plans to restrict winter fuel payments to only the poorest pensioners.  It believes that the approval of the move by MPs will embolden the Labour leadership.  But the paper's editorial argues that even though Sir Keir Starmer's team may have ""dodged a disaster"", ""there are signs of trouble ahead"".  It sees difficulty in next month's Budget, which it warns will be full of ""thorny clauses"" on taxes and spending. The Guardian's opinion column suggests that Sir Keir should ""take the win and let the matter rest there"".  It believes the prime minister needs to move on from his drive to improve the fiscal conditions of the UK and instead focus on the business of ""fixing public services"", like the NHS.  The government, it states, must make ""the right choices, not just tough choices"".   The Mirror agrees.  It points out that Sir Keir and his ministers ought to be coaxing the public's attention back to what the paper judges to be ""much that is good in what the government is doing"". According to the Financial Times, India's Tata Group is ""very close"" to a deal to release £500m of taxpayers' money to support greener steel making at its plant in Port Talbot.  The paper says it has been told by the chairman of Tata's holding company that talks aiming for a possible agreement have been ""going well"".  The FT suggests ministers could make an announcement about it today. Finally, the Times is one of several papers bowled over by a new exhibition of works by Vincent van Gogh at the National Gallery in London.  The headline states: ""Believe the hype: this is a once in a century starburst.""  The paper says the show focuses on the Dutch master's ""feverishly productive years before his death in 1880"", bringing together ""his most spectacular paintings"".   The Guardian, which has one of van Gogh's self-portraits on its front page, agrees.  It concludes that the show is ""heart stopping"" - an exhibition that loves the painter ""as he deserves"" to be loved. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw3x8926l6o,UK to send hundreds more missiles to Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked for more aid to ""drive Russian forces off our land"".",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:05.098378,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The UK will send hundreds more short-range missiles to Ukraine, it was announced ahead of a summit where Volodymyr Zelensky asked for authorisation to strike targets deep inside Russia with Western-supplied weapons. The Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea for further military support during the opening stages of the summit at the Ramstein air base in Germany on Friday. He said the eastern region of Donetsk, where Kyiv's forces are facing Russian attacks, in particular depended on the swift delivery of aid. Also at the summit is UK Defence Secretary John Healey who will confirm the £162 million package, which includes the supply of 650 Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMM). He said the new package would give an ""important boost"" to Ukraine's air defences and show the government was  ""stepping up"" its support. But Prof Michael Clark, the former director-general of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the supply would likely be ""exhausted within a couple of months"".  He said Ukraine needed ""more of everything at the moment"" given the intensity of Russian advances and bombardments.  Lightweight with precision guidance, LMMs have low collateral damage and a range of more than 6km (3.7 miles), according to manufacturer Thales. Hundreds have already been delivered to Ukraine. In July, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer committed to sending £3bn a year to Ukraine for as long as needed. Since the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022, the UK has committed a total of £12.7bn, including £7.6bn in military support. Meanwhile the United States, Kyiv's largest military backer, said it would provide a further $250m (£189.9m) in military aid. Mr Zelensky arrived in Ramstein on Friday morning, just days after a Russian missile attack on the city of Poltava in central Ukraine killed at least 51 people. In an appeal to international allies, he said: ""It’s important that every support package that is announced is promptly put to work on the battlefield without any delay.  ""The fighting in the Donetsk region depends on this - if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin does not have any achievements here, he will not have any achievements anywhere."" Mr Zelensky also called on Western allies to authorise the use of long-range missiles to attack targets within Russia, saying it was the only way to bring about an end to the war. In a direct appeal, he said: ""Now we hear that your long range policy has not changed. We think it is wrong that there are such steps. We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied territory of Ukraine but also on Russian territory."" The UK previously said Ukraine had a ""clear right"" to use British-provided weapons for ""self defence"" which ""does not preclude operations inside Russia,"" following Kyiv's surprise cross-border incursion last month. However, this excludes the use of long-range Storm Shadow missiles in territory outside Ukraine's internationally recognised borders. The US provided long-range missiles to Ukraine earlier this year, but like Kyiv's other Western allies these have not been authorised for use on targets inside Russia. "

The 44-year-old has been described as the Kremlin's top propagandist and ideologue, almost more Putinist than the Russian president himself. Ms Simonyan responded to her name appearing in the US Treasury's sanctions list this week. ""Oh, they woke up,"" she said on X. In reference to other RT employees on the list, she stated: ""Well done, team."" Her views towards the West are perhaps best summarised by comments in her last interview with the BBC, in March, as Mr Putin prepared to secure a fifth term as president in a largely uncontested election. Asked whether there was a serious challenger, she replied: ""Is there a need for a serious opponent? Why? We are not like you.  ""And we don't like you much, really."" Ms Simonyan was born in the Krasnodar region of Russia into an Armenian family. Her academic achievements helped her gain a place on a prestigious exchange programme to the US, and she arrived in New Hampshire in 1995. She later returned to Russia and became a TV journalist. Her rise to prominence came in 2004, when she reported on the Beslan school siege by Chechen militants. It ended after three days with the bloody state response that left hundreds dead, including 186 children.  For Ms Simonyan it led to rapid advancement. Soon after, she was chosen, aged 25, to create and lead the international network Russia Today, later rebranded as RT. From there, over two decades, she has become an outspoken critic of the West and a staunch supporter of Mr Putin, and has presided over a network that has grown from infancy into what the US describes as ""the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet"" central to alleged attempts to disrupt its presidential election. As the years have gone by, both her own rhetoric and that of her channel have toughened. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, as Russia's relationship with the West began to deteriorate, the network started to face accusations that it was spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda. In 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and occupied parts of the east of Ukraine, it became openly hostile both towards Ukraine and the West.  It began referring to the democratically-elected government in Ukraine as the ""Kyiv regime"" and accused Western nations of instigating the country's 2014 revolution, and of trying to undermine or even destroy Russia. But Ms Simonyan is not just at the head of Russia's external propaganda operation - she is also heavily involved in internal messaging and regularly appears on Russian political TV talk shows. Then came Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After years of threats, the UK finally banned her channel. In Russia many top journalists and editors resigned, in what appeared to be a mass exodus in opposition to the war. Ms Simonyan accused former colleagues - and anyone else opposed to the war - of ""not really being Russian"". She played a central role in one of the biggest spy stories of the Ukraine war, publishing a leaked recording of German air force officers discussing long-range weapons that could be given to Ukraine and how they could be used. Her public views are now indistinguishable from Kremlin policy. She has pushed the line that Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions should hold referendums, ""and let people stay with those they want to stay with. It's fair"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy343z53l1o,What are Harris and Trump's policies?,"Economy, immigration, abortion and other top issues - here is where the two candidates stand.",2 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:11.493765,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on different issues. Harris has said her day-one priority would be trying to reduce food and housing costs for working families. She promises to ban price-gouging on groceries, help first-time home buyers and provide incentives to increase housing supply. Trump has promised to “end inflation and make America affordable again”.  He has promised to deliver lower interest rates, something the president does not control, and he says deporting undocumented immigrants will ease pressure on housing. Harris has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and she continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. Trump has struggled to find a consistent message in recent weeks.  The three judges he appointed to the Supreme Court while president were pivotal in overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, a 1973 ruling known as Roe v Wade. Harris was tasked with tackling the root causes of the southern border crisis and helped raise billions of dollars of private money to make regional investments aimed at stemming the flow north. Record numbers of people crossed from Mexico at the end of 2023 but the numbers have fallen since. In this campaign, she has toughened her stance and emphasised her experience as a prosecutor in California taking on human traffickers. Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the construction of a wall and increasing enforcement. But he urged Republicans to ditch a hardline, cross-party border bill, backed by Harris. He has also promised the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history. Experts told the BBC this would face legal challenges. Harris wants to raise taxes on big businesses and Americans making $400,000 (£305,000) a year. But she has also unveiled a number of measures that would ease the tax burden on families, including an expansion of child tax credits. Trump proposes a number of tax cuts worth trillions, including an extension of his 2017 cuts which mostly helped the wealthy. He says he will pay for them through higher growth and tariffs on imports. Analysts say both tax plans will add to the ballooning deficit, but Trump’s by more. Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. She has pledged, if elected, to ensure the US and not China wins ""the competition for the 21st Century"". She has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza. Trump has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world. He has said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel but said little on how he would end the war in Gaza. Harris has criticised Trump’s sweeping plan to put tariffs on imports, calling it a national tax on working families which will cost each household $4,000 a year. She is expected to have a more targeted approach to taxing imports. Trump has made tariffs a central pledge in this campaign. He has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods, and much higher ones on those from China. Harris, as vice-president, helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy, and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programmes.  But she has dropped her opposition to fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil opposed by environmentalists. Trump, while in the White House, rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles.  In this campaign he has vowed to expand Arctic drilling and attacked electric cars. Harris has been part of a White House administration which has reduced prescription drug costs and capped insulin prices at $35. Trump has said he will not renew his attempts while president to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people.  He has called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but that could be opposed by Republicans in Congress. Harris has tried to contrast her experience as a prosecutor with the fact Trump has been convicted of a crime.  Trump has vowed to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime. Harris has made preventing gun violence a key pledge, and she and Tim Walz - both gun owners - often advocate for tighter laws. But they will find that moves like expanding background checks or banning assault weapons will need the help of Congress. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, the constitutional right to bear arms. Addressing the National Rifle Association in May, he said he was their best friend."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rr5qe602o,Climate change is turbo-charging Somalia’s problems - but there's still hope,"Despite facing a catastrophic combination of challenges, there is optimism in the African country.",18 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:11.590068,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Somalia may be one of the poorest countries in the world and beset by violence, but it is “fixable”, according to its top climate official. The country has been torn apart by more than 30 years of overlapping conflicts - including an Islamist insurgency, a civil war, and a series of regional and clan confrontations. Yet Abdihakim Ainte, the Somali prime minister’s climate advisor, still regards his country as “as story of potential - of promise”. What makes his optimism all the more surprising is the fact climate change is amplifying virtually all the challenges his country faces. One commentator described climate change as a “chaos multiplier”, because it exacerbates existing tensions and entrenches conflict in fragile states like this. Listen to Justin Rowlatt’s reporting from Somalia on The Climate Question But Somalia, the easternmost country in continental Africa, can’t be held responsible for our changing climate. The figures are staggering. Somalia has emitted roughly as much carbon dioxide from fossil fuels since the 1950s as the US economy does in an average three days. The most obvious effects of climate change here have been in agriculture. Somalia is still overwhelmingly an agricultural economy, with about two thirds of the population depending on farming and animal herding for most of their income. In 2022 the country experienced its worst drought for 40 years – an event scientists estimate was made 100 times more likely by human-caused climate change. The extent of the challenge Somalia faces became clear as the convoy of International Red Cross (ICRC) Land Cruisers we were travelling in rumbled into the dry scrub that covers most of the country. We were accompanied by three guards clutching AK47s - Somalia is the only country in the world where Red Cross staff travel with armed security as standard. The camel herders and small-scale farmers we met are on the front line of climate change here. For thousands of years Somalis have been eking out a living moving their herds of camels and goats from one pasture to the next across this dry land. But climate change is disrupting the patterns of rain that made this way of life possible. Sheik Don Ismail told us he lost all his camels during the drought, when grazing grounds dried up and the fodder he grew on his small farm wasn't enough to sustain them. “The well became dry and there was no pasture, so the animals began to die,” he said, shaking his head. “The life we lead now is really bad - really bad.” That drought left farmers and herders fighting for access to water and pasture. Sheik Don said he was sometimes forced to defend his land at gunpoint. “There is no respect if you don’t have a gun,” he said. “The herders who lead their animals into the farm stay back when they see my weapon. They get scared.”  In a country divided into rival clan groups and already scarred by violence, these localised disputes can easily spiral into full-blown battles, said Cyril Jaurena, who runs the ICRC operation in Somalia. “Access to boreholes and pastureland gets more and more difficult to find, and so the population in the area might end up fighting - competing for those resources, and sometimes it goes to people shooting at each other,” he warned. And drought isn't the only problem here. Last year Somalia experienced terrible floods as a result of rains scientists say were made twice as intense by human-caused global warming. The floodwater washed away precious soils killing hundreds of people and displacing one million others. The effects of Somalia’s climate change “double whammy” are all too evident in the hunger clinic the Red Cross runs in a hospital in the port city of Kismayo on the south coast. Every day a steady stream of mothers bring their malnourished babies here. Many have had to cross from territory controlled by al-Qaeda’s lethal affiliate, Islamist militants al-Shabab, to get here.  The UN estimates more than 1.5m children under the age of five are acutely malnourished in Somalia. Around four million Somalis have been driven into vast makeshift refugee camps – about a fifth of the total population. Displaced people make their homes out of anything they can get hold of – pieces of old fabric, plastic sheets and rusty corrugated iron - all draped over a web of dry sticks. Some people even unroll tin cans into strips to form parts of their walls. There is little international support, if any. At the refugee camp I visited, just outside the city of Garowe in the north of Somalia, families have to pay for their food and water, as well as pay rent for the scraps of land where they build their shacks. After more than three decades of war, Somalia has fallen way down the list of international priorities. Its problems have been eclipsed by what seem like more urgent conflicts, in places like Ukraine and Gaza. The UN calculates Somalia needs at least $1.6bn (about £1.2bn) to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the people this year, but so far just $600 million has been pledged by donor governments. The entwined impacts of climate and conflict have created a huge reservoir of potential recruits for the country’s many conflicts. Those in the camps are desperate for money, and the easiest work to come by - according to the people I spoke to - is as a paid fighter with one of the many rival armies. One woman told me of her fears for her husband and four of her five sons after they became fighters with a local militia. “They are rural people with no skills, so the only work they could get was in the army,” Halima Ibrahim Ali Mohamud said as we sat on carpets laid over the dirt floor of her hut.   “They were desperate, and when you are without food long enough, and your children are looking at you, you will do anything.”  As we went from shack to shack, mothers told us similar stories of husbands and sons who had left to become fighters, some of whom had been killed. But many Somali people are taking action. The local power station in Garowe has been investing in wind and solar power, for example. The decision wasn’t prompted by some international initiative, says the company CEO. Abdirazak Mohamed said he hasn’t received any grants or aid from abroad. The National Energy Corporation of Somalia (NECSOM), who he works for, is making the investments because renewables - energy derived from natural sources like the sun and the wind - are much better value than the diesel generators the power station used to rely on. I met Somali entrepreneurs setting up businesses, including a woman who had arrived in the Garowe refugee camp with nothing, but who set up a thriving business. Amina Osman Mohamed explained how she had borrowed food from a local stall, cooked it, and used the small profit she made to do the whole thing again the following day. The small but busy café she created generates the extra cash she so desperately needs to care for her sick husband and 11 children - including those of her widowed daughter. As I left Amina’s bustling café, I began to understand why the Somali prime minister’s climate advisor is optimistic about his country’s future. There is hope. But with climate change turbo-charging the conflict here, this country will need continued international help to make peace and build resilience against our changing climate.

The US state department says Mr Blinken will open a so-called “US-UK strategic dialogue” - understood to be a series of meetings between senior officials which Washington describes as “reaffirming” the “special relationship” between the two countries.  Mr Blinken will “discuss a range of critical issues, including the Indo-Pacific, AUKUS partnership, the Middle East, and our collective efforts to support Ukraine,” the state department said.  It is understood Mr Blinken is also likely to meet Prime Minister Keir Starmer while he is in the UK.  The foreign secretary and Mr Blinken met on the Keir Starmer's first visit to Washington as prime minister back in July for the Nato summit.  Following that meeting, the state department said that Mr Blinken and Mr Lammy ""re-affirmed the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the economic, security, and humanitarian assistance it needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity"". The pair also ""discussed the need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of hostages and lays the groundwork for durable peace"". Mr Blinken has been a frequent visitor to Israel, having been 10 times since the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year.  Following his most recent meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Blinken said the Israeli prime minister had accepted Washington's so-called ""bridging proposal"" aimed at trying to solve sticking points and bring Israel and Hamas closer to a deal. Pressure has been growing on Mr Netanyahu to close out a deal, amid widespread protests in Israel last week. On Friday, the White House announced that the UK prime minister will also travel to Washington for his second bilateral meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday 13 September.  The PM said his first face-to face talks with President Biden in July were an opportunity to ""recommit"" to Nato and the ""special relationship"" between the UK and US. Speaking ahead of next week's meeting, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Mr Starmer and Mr Biden will have ""an in-depth discussion on a range of global issues of mutual interest"". The White House added ""robust support to Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression"" will also be discussed, as well as securing a hostage release and ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza.  ""President Biden will underscore the importance of continuing to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,"" the White House also said. "

The leaders signed a memorandum of understanding between the two counties.  President Zelensky said he wanted to ""express his gratitude to Ireland"" after signing the bilateral deal. The deal includes common work on demining Ukraine, which Mr Zelensky said will save Ukrainians and improve the resilience of Europe. He added that the deal also includes common work on cyber security. President Zelensky further thanked Ireland for its support of work on returning abducted Ukrainian children to the country. ""Ireland's participation in the reconstruction of Ukraine will be a substantial support for our people and our countries and our European way of life. ""I thank the people of Ireland, I know that after the beginning of the invasion of Russia of our land, you've accepted and really have warmly welcomed more than 100,000 citizens of Ukraine."" Mr Harris said: ""The people of Ireland stand with the people of Ukraine."" He said Ireland supports Ukraine's efforts on EU membership. Mr Harris said he was ""particularly pleased"" to invite Mr Zelensky for an official visit to Ireland, to which the Ukrainian president nodded. Asked by members of the Ukrainian media about the Irish Government's decision to decrease financial support for newly arriving Ukrainians in Ireland, Simon Harris said ""Ireland will always continue to support people from Ukraine"". Mr Harris added the roughly 109,000 Ukrainians who have been welcomed in Ireland ""made an incredibly positive contribution to Irish society"". However, he said refugee systems are always under review in terms of sustainability. He noted the changes applied to people who were being provided with free food, accommodation and a right to work. President Zelensky said the issue of financial support for refugees would be a matter that would be further discussed with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. However, he said was ""really thankful"" for support already given to Ukrainian citizens by the Irish government. Earlier, the taoiseach visited bombed out and damaged buildings in the Borodyanka and Hostomel areas of the Kyiv. Mr Harris paid tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people during his visit to the city. Speaking ahead of the trip, the taoiseach said that “two-and-a-half years on from Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine continues to face immense challenges"". He added that Ireland has been ""unequivocal and steadfast in our support for the people of Ukraine"". After travelling into the country on an overnight train, the taoiseach was greeted at Nemishaieve station. In a convoy containing Ukrainian and Irish armed forces, Mr Harris passed military checkpoints to first visit Borodyanka, where he inspected apartment buildings and a playground damaged by bombing in early 2022. He saw the entire facade of one building collapsed and a disused playground where children's toys lay on the ground. Mr Harris was guided around the site by the head of Kyiv state's regional administration, Ruslan Kravchenko, who thanked the Taoiseach for Ireland's support for Ukraine. Mr Kravchenko presented Mr Harris with a medal representing the region. The Irish leader's trip to Ukraine comes alongside a pledge of an additional €36m (£30.3m) from Ireland to support humanitarian efforts, as well as ""rehabilitation and eventual reconstruction"" in Ukraine. The money includes funding for the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF and the Red Cross. The Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister), Micheál Martin, said the package would ""provide much-needed humanitarian support and development assistance to people suffering the impact of this unjust war"". ""Recognising the particularly horrific impact of the war on women and children, Ireland’s assistance in 2024 prioritises prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence, support for maternity services and rebuilding of homes for people forced to flee conflict and now living in collective centres,"" he said. This latest funding announcement will bring Ireland’s total funding to Ukraine since February 2022 to more than €380m."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl1zd07l1o,When is the Budget and what might be in it?,Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out the government's financial plans for the next year.,3 hrs ago,2024-10-14 18:28:11.964654,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver Labour's first Budget on Wednesday 30 October. At the beginning of September, she told the BBC it would involve ""difficult decisions"" on tax, spending and benefits.  However, her speech at the Labour Party conference was more optimistic about the future of the economy. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. The speech outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes.  It also includes big decisions about spending on health, schools, police and other public services. The previous Conservative Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, delivered the last Budget in March 2024, before the general election. But after a change of government, the new chancellor holds another Budget, in autumn, to set out their financial priorities. The 2024 autumn Budget is on Wednesday 30 October. The Budget speech usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. It will be broadcast live on the BBC iPlayer and on the BBC News website. The current leader of the opposition, Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak, will give a speech responding to the Budget as soon as Reeves sits down. The Treasury, the government department in charge of the economy and public spending, publishes a report alongside the Budget speech. It gives more details about the measures announced and what they will cost. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors government spending, also produces an independent assessment of the health of the UK economy.  After the statement, MPs spend several days debating the plans. They are then asked to approve the proposals and the government introduces a Finance Bill to turn the Budget announcements into law. The chancellor's speech at the Labour Party conference confirmed that boosting the economy is one of the government's key priorities. Reeves talked about the ""long-term prize"" that would follow if Labour can restore stability. A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. Following a brief recession at the end of 2023, the UK grew solidly during the first six months of 2024, and recorded the fastest growth of all the G7 countries. However, the UK economy stalled in June and July. When Labour took power, Reeves said it had ""inherited the worst set of circumstances since the Second World War"" regarding government finances - something the Conservatives deny. She said she was facing  a £22bn ""black hole"", and warned that the government would have to raise some taxes as a result. This gap is due to rules the government has chosen to follow over how much money it can borrow over the next five years. At the election Labour promised not to increase taxes on ""working people"", and said it would not raise VAT (value added tax), income tax or National Insurance. But after the warning about ""difficult decisions"", there has been a lot of speculation about other possible tax rises which could be announced: Capital gains tax (CGT) CGT is charged on the profit made from the sale of assets that have increased in value, such as second homes or investments. It is paid by individuals and some business owners, and the rates vary depending on how much income tax you pay. Inheritance tax (IHT) IHT, which is currently 40%, is usually paid on the value of a deceased person's assets above a threshold of £325,000. Fuel duty Fuel duty has not risen in more than a decade. It was frozen between 2012 and 2022, and cut by 5p in March 2022 when pump prices surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, some motoring groups argue the cut was never passed on to motorists and the RAC says it could be reversed. Pension taxation Various options exist for the chancellor to bring more money into the Treasury from taxation on pensions. That could include reducing the cap on tax-free lump sums from pension pots, reducing a tax break for employers putting money into employees' pensions, or changing the system of tax relief on pension contributions. At the moment, savers receive tax relief at the same rate as their income tax - so basic rate taxpayers get tax relief at 20% and higher rate taxpayers at 40% or 45%. The government could introduce a single flat rate of relief which would make the system less generous for higher earners, although reports have suggested this is now an unlikely move. Non-dom tax status The term ""non-dom"" describes a UK resident whose permanent home - or domicile - for tax purposes is outside the UK. As a result, they do not pay UK tax on money they make elsewhere. In the March Budget, the then-Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said non-dom tax status would be abolished, although there were some concessions. Labour has said it wants to toughen the existing plans, although these plans might be reconsidered amid worries they will bring in less money than expected. National Insurance contributions by employers The government's phrase that it would not raise taxes on ""working people"" has led to speculation that it could still increase National Insurance (NI) rates for employers. NI is paid by both workers and companies. Employers pay NI on their workers' earnings at a rate of 13.8%. At the moment companies do not pay NI on pension contributions they make to employees, but reports have suggested this could change in the Budget.  Winter fuel payments The government has said future payments will only be made to those getting pension credit or other means-tested help.  The plans have been criticised by some MPs, unions and charities. State pension The state pension is set to rise by 4% in April 2025. The increase will be confirmed by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall around the time of the Budget. VAT on private schools The government has said VAT will be added to private school fees from 1 January. Some private schools will lose business rates relief. Energy windfall tax The government is increasing the windfall tax on the profits oil and gas firms make in the UK. The energy profits levy is due to rise to 38% from 35% on 1 November, and will remain in place until 31 March 2030."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c303y5m1p19o,ICC chief prosecutor defends Netanyahu arrest warrant in BBC interview,Mr Khan tells the BBC it is important to show the court will hold all nations to the same standard.,5 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:12.072779,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has told the BBC that justice must be seen to be done after seeking an arrest warrant for Israel's prime minister and defence minister.  Karim Khan said it was important to show the court would hold all nations to the same standard in relation to alleged war crimes. He also welcomed the new UK government's decision to drop its opposition to the arrest warrants. “There's a difference of tone and I think of substance in relation to international law by the new government. And I think that's welcome,” he told Political Thinking with Nick Robinson. He has also requested warrants for three Hamas leaders, two of whom have since been killed. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Khan explained the ICC needed to request warrants for leaders on both sides to ensure people around the world thought the court was applying “the law equally based upon some common standards”. “If one had applied for warrants in relation to Israeli officials and not for Gaza, [some would] say: ‘well, this is an obscenity’ and, ‘how on earth is that possible?’” he said. “You can't have one approach for countries where there's support, whether it's Nato support, European support [and] powerful countries behind you, and a different approach where you have clear jurisdiction,"" he added. In May, Mr Khan said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders Yahiya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh bore criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the day of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October onwards. However the request for the warrants must yet be approved by ICC judges.  Mr Khan said Israel's prime minister and defence minister were suspected of crimes including starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, and extermination. He accused the Hamas leaders of having committed crimes including extermination, murder, hostage taking, rape and sexual violence, and torture. Israel and Hamas have both rejected the allegations. US President Joe Biden said the application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders was ""outrageous"". But Mr Khan told the BBC that unlike his critics, he had seen the evidence the warrant requests were based on.  “I have one advantage at least. Hopefully even they will concede I've seen the evidence. They haven't,"" he said. “The application is not public. It is confidential. It is filed to the chamber. So they are guessing what evidence has been submitted."" The previous UK Conservative government had indicated it planned to make a submission to the court, having questioned the right of the prosecutor to apply for a warrant against the Israeli leaders.  But in July, a spokesperson for the Labour administration which succeeded it said the issue was a ""matter for the court"" and therefore would not be making a submission.  Mr Khan told the BBC he had been pressured by some world leaders not to issue warrants. “Several leaders and others told me and advised me and cautioned me,” he said. Turning to the war in Ukraine, Mr Khan said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""see the inside of a courtroom"", pointing to historic cases of other world leaders being brought before the court.  “Nothing is permanent. Life is transitory. And every political life ends in failure,"" he said. Mr Putin was not arrested during his visit on Tuesday to Mongolia, an ICC signatory, despite the valid arrest warrant for alleged war crimes committed during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The Russian leader is wanted for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children since the start of the war in 2022. Moscow has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were ""outrageous"". ------ Karim Khan's interview with Nick Robinson will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 17:30 BST on Saturday and is already available on BBC Sounds and the Political Thinking website."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlv7jdnq8o,Right-wing US influencers say they were victims of alleged Russian plot,"Several commentators said that, if the allegations proved true, they were ""deceived"" by the Russian government front.",6 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:12.148813,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Conservative US influencers say if the allegations are proven, they were deceived by Russian media executives following the release of an indictment charging Moscow with interfering in the 2024 US election.  The indictment accuses state broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today, of paying a Tennessee firm $10m (£7.6m) to ""create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging"". US media outlets identified the firm as Tenet Media, which describes itself as ""network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues"". Tenet Media, which was not directly named in the indictment, was founded in 2022 by conservative Canadian YouTuber Lauren Chen and her husband Liam Donovan. Tenet has not commented publicly on the allegations and did not respond to a request for comment. The network employs several well-known right-wing US influencers - such as Tim Pool, David Rubin and Benny Johnson - who say they are ""victims"" of the alleged plot if it is proven. US officials characterised the US and Canada-based influencers that worked for Tenet as ""unwitting"" figures in the Russian scheme, which allegedly paid some commentators hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to make videos for the platform. The indictment says that videos - which often promoted right-wing narratives on issues such as immigration, gender and the economy - were secretly ""edited, posted, and directed"" by two RT employees.  “While the views expressed in the videos are not uniform, the subject matter and content of the videos are often consistent with the Government of Russia’s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine,” the indictment said. Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva were identified in the indictment as the RT staffers. The justice department has charged them with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  In a response to a request for comment on the indictment, RT's press team said: ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"".  The indictment says that Mr Kalashnikov ""monitored"" the company's ""funding, hiring and contract negotiations"" with some of the commentators and Ms Afanasyeva was involved in the firm's editorial efforts.  It is said that the company's founders did find the ease they had in acquiring funding to be suspicious.  The platform's two founders ""admitted to each other in their private communications that their 'investors' were, in truth and in fact, the 'Russians'"", the indictment says.  Several of the influencers said on social media that, if the allegations are true, they should be considered ""victims"" of the plot. They also insisted that they maintained full editorial control over their content.  Mr Pool, whose The Culture War Podcast was licensed by Tenet Media, told his 2.1 million followers on X/Twitter that if ""these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims. I cannot speak for anyone else at the company as to what they do or to what they are instructed"". Mr Johnson, who has 2.7 million followers on X, said on Wednesday that he was “disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme”. He said that his company's lawyers had ""negotiated a standard, arms length deal"" after they were approached by the media startup. He said that agreement was later terminated. Mr Rubin, who boasts 1.5 million followers on X, said his show on Tenet ended months ago, and that he had not been contacted by the justice department. ""I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme,"" he wrote concerning the allegations. ""I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity."" The indictment says that the media company posted about 2,000 videos that received more than 16 million views on YouTube since the plot got underway.  “The company never disclosed to the influencers or to their millions of followers its ties to RT and the Russian government,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Wednesday. Two of Tenet Media's other contributors said on a livestream that they were never told what to say in their content. “How am I unwittingly duped into saying someone else’s words when I wrote every one of them?” Matt Christiansen, a less prominent commentator, said.  The court document alleges that the commentators exacted a huge payout in negotiations, with three of the biggest stars getting paid $8.7m. According to the indictment, the Russian scheme directed a founder of the media company to recruit two conservative influencers by offering them $2m a year.  The indictment says that one of the commentators responded that ""it would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested"", and the other said ""it would take 100k per weekly episode to make it worth his while"". The first influencer allegedly eventually agreed to make four videos per month for $400,000, and the other, according to the indictment, allegedly agreed to be paid $100,000 per video.  To close the negotiations, the Russians allegedly fabricated a Hungarian businessman named ""Eduard Grigoriann"" as a key investor. They went so far as to create a fake CV for the false identity, according to the court documents, and held phone calls with an agent posing as him.  The indictment cites multiple instances in which the platform's employees had their own suspicions about the arrangement they found themselves in.  Ms Afanasyeva is said to have shared a video to be posted made by a well-known political commentator visiting a grocery store in Russia. Media outlets have identified this alleged commentator as Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News star, who visited Russia to interview President Vladimir Putin.  He uses Russia's store prices to opine on US inflation and cost-of-living issues. There is no suggestion he was aware of the alleged plot. According to the indictment, a producer privately messaged one of the company's founders complaining that ""they want me to post this"" but added that ""it just feels like overt shilling"". The producer is said to have ultimately put the video out at the founder's direction. At another point, Ms Afanasyeva allegedly directed one of the founders to get ""one of our creators"" to ""record something about (the) Moscow terror attack"" in an effort to link it to Ukraine and the United States, despite the Islamic State claiming responsibility. The indictment suggests that the commentators ultimately fulfilled her requests, but Ms Afanasyeva is said to have grown annoyed multiple times when she did not think they were promoting the company's videos enough.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m0ylnkylko,Ukraine says soldiers among 51 killed in Poltava missile attack,President Zelensky says two Russian missiles struck a military training institute.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:12.235028,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"At least 51 people have been killed and 271 others injured in a Russian missile strike on the city of Poltava, in central Ukraine.  A military academy and a nearby hospital were hit. Ukraine's land forces confirmed that military personnel were killed in the attack.   People did not have enough time to get to bomb shelters after the air raid alarm sounded, Ukraine's ministry of defence said.  President Volodymyr Zelensky promised that what he called ""Russian scum"" would pay for the attack, and repeated calls for more air defences so that Ukraine could protect itself by carrying out its own long-range missile attacks. Moscow has not commented on the attack.   People nearby told us their windows were blown out by the force of the impact.  We met 26-year-old Mykyta Petrov, a cadet who only started at the Poltava Military Communications Institute two weeks ago. He described the moment the attack unfolded just after 09:00 local time on Tuesday morning (06:00 GMT), saying the second missile hit just three seconds after the first. “I ran outside, there was smoke and dust everywhere…lots of people were outside having a cigarette, and many were killed…” He says that what he saw has affected him psychologically, that there was “too much blood, too many dead bodies.” Earlier reports from Russian military bloggers suggested that cadets were gathered at a military parade being held at the institute, but the ministry confirmed there was no parade happening at the time of the strike.   Alarms sounded at 09:08 local time and everyone headed to the shelter, the defence ministry added. The explosions started a few minutes after the alarms.   Thirty-year-old year old Yana Kulishova was one of them. She was woken by the air raid siren but did not have time to reach a shelter. For her, the attack is personal. Her husband is fighting on the front line in the Donbas region. “Soldiers have died here and I know there are still soldiers still under the rubble. Their wives are waiting for them."" Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko told the BBC the two minutes between the air raid siren in Poltava and the missiles landing was ""nothing"".  ""You just imagine you're on the sixth floor of some building and you need to run away downstairs. Is it realistic that you can do this in two minutes?"" he said.  ""Just imagine this life and like this several times per day. We can't continue like this. It's just not fair."" In a statement on Telegram which confirmed the deaths of the military personnel, Ukraine's land forces said an investigation was under way to establish whether enough was done to protect those in the facility the missile hit.  It confirmed additional measures to ensure safety at military facilities would be increased.  Firefighters have been on the scene with all their equipment clearing out buildings, and army personnel outside have stopped people. They cannot get too close due to the sensitivity of the site.  Earlier, one Poltava resident, Olena Serdyuk, said: ""The air raid alert started in just a minute, and then there were two explosions.  ""At home, we immediately ran into the bathroom with the child, but then gathered ourselves"".  She added that there is no bomb shelter ""in our radius"", and it ""takes a long time to run somewhere"". Another local, Anastasiia Artyukh, heard ""two very strong explosions"" and called the situation ""really scary"". ""There is a house nearby, everything was blown out, all the windows. We don't have a basement in our house. So our only option was to sit [and wait]."" Poltava regional governor Philip Pronin called the attack a ""cunning and cynical Russian strike,"" and later said that 15 people were still thought to be trapped under the rubble.  Mr Pronin said search groups were on site, and that 10 residential buildings had been damaged in the attack.   More details could not immediately be given due to security reasons, he said.   Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska posted on X calling the attack ""a stunning tragedy for all of Ukraine,"" and added: ""Russia is taking away the most valuable thing from us - life.""  In a video on the Ukrainian presidential website, President Zelensky said Russia would be held accountable for the strike.  In the clip, which was also posted on X, Mr Zelensky said a ""full and prompt"" investigation had been ordered and that ""all necessary services are involved in the rescue operation"".  He went on to say that Ukraine needed long-range air defence systems ""that can protect us from Russian terror"" and added that ""every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives"".  The UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the ""sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,"" and said ""my thoughts are with all the victims and their loved ones."" US President Joe Biden described it as a ""deplorable attack"", adding that it was ""a tragic reminder of Putin’s ongoing and outrageous attempts to break the will of a free people"".  ""The United States will continue stand with [the people of Ukraine] - including providing the air defense systems and capabilities they need to protect their country,"" he said in a White House statement. Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said President Putin ""knows no limits to brutality"". There has also been criticism of the Ukrainian authorities in the aftermath of the attack.  Maria Bezugla, a Ukrainian MP who often criticizes the country's military leadership, accused officials of putting soldiers in danger.  ""These tragedies keep repeating themselves. When will it stop?"" she wrote on Telegram.  Since the attack, changes within the Ukrainian government have been announced -  with potentially more to come.  The minister in charge of weapons reduction resigned on Tuesday and one senior lawmaker for Mr Zelensky's party said a ""major government reset"" was coming that would see more than half of minsters change.   ""Tomorrow a day of sackings awaits us, and a day of appointments the day after,"" David Arakhamia said. The attack on the military institute in Poltava came as Russian leader Vladimir Putin arrived in Mongolia - his first visit to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member since it issued a warrant for his arrest last year. Poltava, located in central Ukraine, had a pre-war population of 300,000 and is located 300 kilometres (189 miles) east of Kyiv.  Founded in the 1960s, when Ukraine was still part of the USSR, the Poltava military communications institute trains telecommunications specialists.   with additional reporting by Kyla Herrmannsen"

The mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says a water treatment plant and the entrance of a metro station used as a shelter were hit. Two schools and a university were also damaged.  According to Ukraine’s military, 22 cruise and air ballistic missiles were destroyed by the air force. Local authorities say three people were injured by debris from destroyed missiles. For schoolchildren across the capital, Monday's bombardment coincided with the first day of the school year, a day of celebration in Ukraine.  Teachers and parents tried to keep a sense of normality, with music playing while smiling students were welcomed by a sea of flowers.  One parent, who hid with her daughter at home during the missile attack before taking her to school, said they were showing once more ""that this nation is invincible"". “Children are smiling, but you can see the strain on the faces of their teachers [who] carry this burden”, she told the BBC. “I’m so thankful to them for all they did to make it a real holiday for the kids."" For 33-year-old Yevheniia, who was taking her six-year-old daughter to school for the first time, the day was marred by fear. “Her hands were shaking,” Yevheniia told the Reuters news agency.  “Our apartment started to stink of smoke, but we still need to go to school, right? We are Ukrainians,” she said she told her daughter that morning. Alina, a student at the damaged university, told Ukrainian TV she “started screaming” when the air raid alert sounded, with everyone running into their dormitory's bomb shelter. Air raid sirens rang out for nearly two hours during the attack, before the skies were deemed clear by the military.  “We were very scared,” Alina said, adding they saw a fire following the sound of explosions. Following the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the first day  of school ""one of the most important days of the year"" for children, and their families and teachers.  ""All our schools, all higher education institutions that are working today are proof of the resilience of our people and the strength of Ukraine,” he said on his Telegram channel. All of Ukraine was placed on alert for several hours, and neighbouring Nato state Poland said it had deployed its own as well as allied aircraft to secure its airspace during the Russian strikes. Russia's forces last month advanced on 477 sq km (184 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory - the biggest monthly increase by Moscow since October 2022 - according to data from the Institute for the Study of War analysed by AFP. Russian President Vladimir Putin said his forces have not advanced with “such a pace” in the Donbas “for a long time"" and are taking several sq km of territory per day. Meanwhile, in Russia’s Kursk region - where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion on 6 August - progress has slowed with Kyiv most recently claiming to control 1,294 sq km (500 sq miles) of territory, including 100 settlements. Nearly 600 Russian soldiers have also been captured, it added. But President Putin - who was speaking to children starting their own new school year -  said this will not deter his forces' advance into eastern Ukraine, claiming they were moving forward at the fastest rate in a ""long time"". ""Their calculation was to stop our offensive actions in key parts of the Donbas. The result is known... they did not achieve stopping our advance,” he said. Some critics in Ukraine have suggested that the incursion in Kursk has diverted seasoned troops from the Donbas frontline at a critical moment.  However, President Zelensky defended the offensive on Monday, saying it was proceeding ""according to the plan"". He said the attack could ease the pressure on the eastern front. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqj35jv3e7o,Mother and daughters killed in new wave of strikes on Ukraine,The strike came as Ukraine was still reeling from the deaths of at least 50 people on Tuesday.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:18.225431,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A mother and her three daughters were among seven people killed in Ukraine's western city of Lviv, during a fresh wave of Russian attacks. A baby and another girl were also killed, officials said. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovy said Russia had attacked with drones and hypersonic missiles early on Wednesday.  The attack came as Ukraine reeled from Russia's deadliest single bombardment this year - a strike on a military institute in the central city of Poltava that left 53 people dead. Explosions were also heard on Wednesday over the capital Kyiv as air defences targeted Russian missiles. Five people were wounded in Kryvyy Rih when a hotel was hit and nearby blocks of flats were damaged. The attack on Lviv in the far west of Ukraine came as all of Ukraine was under air raid alert. Witnesses said the city was targeted at about 05:40 (02:40 GMT). Russia's defence ministry said it had fired Kinzhal hypersonic weapons at Ukrainian defence industry facilities in Lviv and that all designated targets had been hit. However, Mr Sadovy said Russia's attack had damaged more than 50 buildings in the historic heart of Lviv, including homes, schools and clinics.  He posted a picture on social media of a local family, saying that only the father had survived. His wife, Yevgenia, and their three daughters - Darina, Emilia and 21-year-old Yaryna - all died in their own home, he said. The Ukrainian air force said Russia had fired 13 missiles and 29 attack drones and that seven cruise missiles and 22 drones were shot down. Mr Sadovy said some buildings were struck near the railway station and Lviv regional administration head Maksym Kozytskyi said residential buildings had been damaged in the attack. Lviv has largely been spared the worst of the fighting over the two and a half years of war, but last week, Russian strikes targeted its energy infrastructure causing outages, according to officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his calls for Ukraine's Western allies to all their long-range weapons to be fired further into Russia. In Poltava, rescue workers continued to search through the rubble of the military communications institute for survivors of the attack.  Mykyta Petrov, a 26-year-old cadet who only started there two weeks ago, said two missiles hit shortly after 09:00 (06:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the second detonating just three seconds after the first. “I ran outside, there was smoke and dust everywhere…lots of people were outside having a cigarette, and many were killed."" The cadet said there was “too much blood, too many dead bodies"", and what he had seen had affected him psychologically. An air raid siren had gone off two minutes earlier, but had not given people enough time to reach bomb shelters.  ""You just imagine you're on the sixth floor of some building and you need to run away downstairs. Is it realistic that you can do this in two minutes?"" Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko told the BBC. Officials said 271 people had been wounded in the Russian strikes on Poltava, and by Wednesday afternoon, 400 people had already given blood at the main regional hospital. Among them was Oleksandr Moskvich, 38, who was badly wounded on the frontline last year in the fierce battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut. He pointed to scars on his neck and back where he had been shot by Russian troops while he was on patrol. ""At the moment I can only give people my blood, my support. I can talk to them and try to understand, because I passed through this."" Poltava is observing three days of mourning and there was an eerie quiet throughout the hospital. A Ukrainian flag flew outside the building with a black ribbon attached, while inside, the corridors of the blood donation ward were filled as people waited their turn.  The doctor in charge of blood donation, Volodymyr Rudikov, said the people of Poltava had joined together at an unimaginably difficult time: “This is something I’ve never seen in my 16 years as a chief doctor.""  President Zelensky promised that what he called ""Russian scum"" would pay for the attack, and repeated calls for more air defences so Ukraine could protect itself by carrying out its own long-range missile attacks.

Poltava regional governor Philip Pronin called the attack a ""cunning and cynical Russian strike,"" and later said 15 people were still thought to be trapped under the rubble. Mr Zelensky was due to meet the Irish premier on Wednesday as Ireland prepared to announce new funding for Ukraine's war effort.  The Irish government said the package would provide essential humanitarian assistance, support rehabilitation and eventual reconstruction, and contribute to Ukraine's longer-term goals."

He was welcomed by Mongolia's leader at a lavish ceremony in the Asian nation's capital Ulaanbaatar on Tuesday. The Russian leader is wanted by the court for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. A spokesperson from the Kremlin said it was not concerned Mr Putin would be arrested during the visit. Soldiers on horseback lined the capital's Genghis Khan Square as martial anthems were played by a live band to welcome the Russian leader, who met with the Mongolian president Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh. A small group of protesters gathered at the square on Monday afternoon, holding a sign demanding ""Get War Criminal Putin out of here"". Another protest is planned for midday Tuesday at Ulaanbaatar's Monument for the Politically Repressed, which commemorates those who suffered under Mongolia's decades-long Soviet-backed communist regime. Other protestors were prevented from getting close to the Russian president on his arrival by security forces.  Ahead of his visit, Ukraine had urged Mongolia to arrest Mr Putin. ""We call on the Mongolian authorities to comply with the mandatory international arrest warrant and transfer Putin to the International Criminal Court in the Hague,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Telegram. The court alleged last year that the Russian president was responsible for war crimes, focusing on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.  It has also issued a warrant for the arrest of Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the same crimes. It alleges the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has previously denied the allegations and said the  warrants were ""outrageous"". ICC members are expected to detain suspects if an arrest warrant has been issued, but there is no enforcement mechanism. The Hague-based court last week said members had ""an obligation"" to take action. Mongolia has not publicly responded to Ukraine or the ICC's call.  The former Soviet satellite state has maintained friendly relations with Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and declined to vote on the conflict at the United Nations. The landlocked country, which also borders China, also relies on Russia for gas and electricity. Russia has been in talks for years about building a pipeline to carry 50 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas a year from its Yamal region to China via Mongolia. The project, known as Power of Siberia 2, is part of a strategy to compensate for the drop in gas sales in Europe, following widespread boycott of Russian resources due to the invasion of Ukraine. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qe9ql8v95o,Meeting the Ukrainian recruits preparing for new battle,"As Kyiv fights on home soil and in Russia, Nick Beake speaks to recruits being sent to the battlefield.",2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:18.433254,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"For the previous 72 hours, the menacing whirr above our heads has belonged to Russia’s suicide drones, passing over and then bearing down on their targets. Now the buzz comes from a Ukrainian unmanned aircraft which has not been sent up to kill, but to relay footage from the training ground to commanders back at base. We’ve been brought to a secret training location in the Chernihiv region where the latest army intake is being fast tracked to the battlefield in the renewed effort to blunt Moscow’s grinding advance. In the hail of machine gun fire and instructors’ commands, the most striking aspect of the scene is the age of the new recruits. Most seem to be in their 40s and 50s.  Among the grey-haired contingent, Rostyslav, whose wife and two children are waiting for him back home in the Odesa region. A month ago he was a driver. Next month he could find himself fighting on Russian soil, with Ukraine vowing to hold on to the land it seized in the Kursk region during its lightning incursion a month ago. “I think this is the right thing to do,” he says of the operation. “Look how long they’ve been on our land. We’ve been suffering for so long, we have to do something. You can't just sit there while they are capturing our territory. What will we do then? Will we become their slaves?"" The training schedule we’re witnessing reflects the accelerated programme new army joiners are undergoing as Ukraine tries to deal with the sheer mass of men Russia is committing to the frontline. The Ministry of Defence in London estimated there were 70,000 Russian casualties in Ukraine in May and June alone. Under the scorching sun, the new Ukrainian recruits jump in and out of American-made armoured fighting vehicles and open fire on enemy positions. The military, anxious that the location of this training remains secret, asked to see the footage we recorded on location before this story was reported across BBC News - but did not see any scripts nor have any editorial control. In a nearby woodland, a simulated Russian attack on Ukrainian trenches is repelled while the boom of grenade target practice shudders across the plain. Two and a half years into the war, and Ukraine is desperate for more troops and brought into force a new conscription law which lowered the age of men joining from 27 to 25. Military service for women is not mandatory. The drive for younger conscripts has not hit this group of men. All the recruits we see before us have already had 30 days of basic training and today it’s more advanced care - dealing with broken bones, gunshots and catastrophic bleeding - using medical equipment sent from the UK. Light-hearted moments - a decidedly wonky tourniquet here or there - punctuate a heavy air. There’s no escaping the fact the simulated emergency care being given under shade of spruces could be carried out in grim reality in the coming weeks and months. One soldier who’s accompanied us to the site says that if the new intake have not acquired enough fighting skills they will not be sent to the frontline. “We’re not going to send them to their deaths,” he says sharply. Still, we have heard complaints, notably from professional soldiers, that raw recruits have been sent to other fronts without adequate training and thrust prematurely into frontline combat. Ukraine is on the back foot in key parts of the battlefield at home, most notably around the strategically important city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk. But last month’s incursion into Russia has boosted morale and has added a new dimension to the war. However, Kyiv is now fighting a battle on yet another front and this is a huge personal gamble for President Zelensky. His generals have tough strategic decisions to make about where to send their new recruits. Maxim, a 30-year-old builder by trade, looks to be the most youthful of the cohort. “We need to train, train and train again. The more we train the more we will learn here. It will help us on the frontline.” Where will that be, I ask? “We are ready to defend our land either in Donbas - or Kursk,” he says proudly but with a nervous laugh. Earlier, in Ukraine’s Sumy region, we had travelled under military escort to a new Ukrainian base just a few miles away from the Russian border. Along the way, we passed whole streets blasted to pieces by previous Russian artillery fire. The civilians had long gone, and the only human life was clad in the green and driving army vehicles. As we arrive at the camp, an armoured personnel carrier (APC) fresh from the Kursk incursion roars into life and springs up backwards out of its sunken hiding place. It pivots and then speeds off through the canopy lined track, leaving a huge plume of copper-coloured dust. “The Russian soldiers who surrendered, we took as prisoners of war. The Russians who attacked us, we killed.” It’s a blunt synopsis from the Ukrainian commander who goes by the call-sign “Storm”. His 22nd Mechanised Brigade was the first to enter Russian territory and now he’s returned to tell the tale. “We went far into the Kursk region. We were alone as the forward team. We were on foreign soil and we felt like foreigners. Not in our home.” A father of five with five degrees, Storm cuts a distinctive shadow in the dense forest. A giant of a man with greying goatee and military tattoos on the skin not covered by his army fatigues and body armour. “That’s us, in there,” he says showing us a video on his phone of an APC  tearing through the Russian countryside. What was it like fighting the Russians on their home soil, I ask? “I worried for myself and for my group, for my servicemen, for everyone. Of course, there was fear. “ Like all of the Ukrainian military we met, Storm is understandably reluctant to give any operational information which may help the Russians. So when I ask if he knows how long he’ll stay on Russian territory when he returns, it is an answer predictably long on patriotism and short on specifics. “We are fulfilling an order. We'll be there as long as we are told to. If we are told to move forward, we will move forward. If they tell us to withdraw, we will withdraw.” He continues in the same vein: “If we have an order to move forward, we can get to Moscow - and we'll show what Ukraine means and what are our guys are like - real Cossacks.” It’s been reported that Ukraine sent up to 10,000 elite troops into Russia as part of its rapid advance. The Russian defence ministry claims Kyiv has suffered thousands of casualties. The head of the Ukrainian army, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, announced the Russians had now sent 30,000 troops to defend Kursk. All these figures are hard to verify. In another clandestine location, a team clambers out of a German-made Bergepanzer armoured recovery vehicle. The driver, who goes by the call sign “Producer”, is a father of two who hasn’t seen his two children for three years. They escaped to Italy with their mother in the weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. While we’re unable to ascertain the level of Ukrainian losses, it’s clear that Producer has been busy bringing back damaged and destroyed vehicles from inside Russia. “I want this war to come to an end,” he tells us wearily in very good English. “That’s because there is no reason for this (war). One man, Vladimir Putin, attacked our country.  So what do we have to do? We must defend our home. Defending, defending, defending. But Ukraine is the smaller country.” The mismatch between Moscow and Kyiv remains a key thread of President Zelensky’s ongoing call for greater Western help. Through taking the fight into Russia, Ukraine galvanised its public but worried some allies who remain fearful of Vladimir Putin’s response and the spectre of a wider conflict. So far, President Putin has largely ignored, at least publicly, the wound inflicted on his country’s side. Ukraine says that, unlike Russia, it doesn’t have unlimited reserves of conscripts to catapult to the frontline. We saw a glimpse of the deployment dilemma with our own eyes in the locations we visited this past week. President Zelensky argues that much greater American and European assistance in air defence is more vital than ever and that permission to use foreign-made long range missiles to strike further into Russia urgently needs to be granted. Especially now that Kyiv is fighting a battle at home and abroad. As we leave the training ground, the exhausted soldiers loll on the ground - water bottle and cigarette in hand for many. Rostyslav, who longs to return to his Odesa, believes his president is absolutely right. “The Russians can reach our territory with long range weapons and we don't have such a weapon to reach their territory. We can't stand this anymore” he explains. “We would like to hit Moscow to end this dirty war. Children and civilians suffer, everyone does.” Another rocket-propelled grenade thunders across the parched training field. Next time, it won’t be a drill.

Michael Velychko, 30, was born in Poltava in Central Ukraine and now lives on a little farm with his two brothers. Mr Velychko was 15 years old when he first started oil painting and has now sold 200 works of art to collectors in England, America and Europe. His work is being exhibited at the Sentinel Gallery in Wivenhoe and money raised will be donated to the Children's Hospital in Kyiv. Mr Velychko told BBC Essex that he would not be able to attend the exhibition in person due to Russia invading Ukraine in 2022. In a written message to the BBC he said: ""As you know we have a war going on in Ukraine and no men are allowed to leave the country. ""I therefore can not be personally at the exhibition in Wivenhoe."" The painter managed to get his artwork in the exhibition thanks to his friendship with John Eborn, who runs the Medder Gallery in Lavenham, Suffolk. Mr Eborn, now retired, said he had bought paintings from Mr Velychko in 2017 but when the war started, he received a message from the painter asking for help. ""He is an artist, a true artist and he can see the best in things."" Mr Ebron said Mr Velychko's artwork is a form of ""escapism, but it is a positive escapism.""  Mr Velychko said: ""In the last [few] days we had the worst attacks since the war started.  ""As we have power cuts and the lift is not working I stay in the bathroom and try to paint or do some IT work. ""At the moment we have difficult times."" Mr Eborn added: ""He is only young and yet he has already given me his last will and testament wishes. ""He supports his elderly parents and I do everything I can pro bono.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02v5x5expo,Ukraine's foreign minister resigns as government reshuffle expected,The parliamentary head of the ruling party says half the cabinet will be replaced in a reshuffle this week.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:18.595458,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba has stepped down from his role as part of a wide-ranging reshuffle of the Ukrainian cabinet.   Several Ukrainian officials also resigned from their posts on Tuesday, leaving some of the government's top jobs vacant, including the strategic industries minister in charge of weapons production. The parliamentary leader of the ruling Servant of the People party said half of the cabinet would be changed in a major government reshuffle this week. Mr Kuleba, who is the most senior of the ministers to resign, has been in post since March 2020. MP Inna Sovsun told the BBC there were ""no questions"" about Mr Kuleba's efficiency and that she was not aware of any disagreements between him and President Volodymyr Zelensky. However, Ms Sovsun said that in the absence of parliamentary or presidential elections which have been suspended due to martial law, ""reshuffling the government is the best way to bring in new people, new ideas into the government which are very badly needed at the moment"". Those who handed in their resignations on Tuesday included strategic industries minister Alexander Kamyshin, justice minister Denys Maliuska, environmental protection minister Ruslan Strilets, deputy prime ministers Olha Stefanishyna and Iryna Vereshchuk, and the head of Ukraine's State Property Fund, Vitaliy Koval. One of the president's most senior aides, Rostyslav Shurma, was also dismissed by presidential decree.  David Arakhamiya, the parliamentary leader of the ruling Servant of the People party, confirmed on Telegram that a ""major government reset"" would see more than half of the Cabinet of Ministers' staff changed, and that Thursday would be a ""day of appointments"". During his nightly video address on Tuesday, President Zelensky said state institutions ""should be configured so that Ukraine achieves all the results that we need"". ""For this, we must strengthen some areas of the government and changes in its make-up have been prepared. There will also be changes in the [president's] office,"" he said. Opposition MP Iryna Gerashchenko criticised the government's reshuffle, stating that this is ""a government without ministers. A parliament without a mono-majority. An intellectual and personnel crisis to which the authorities turn a blind eye."" She called for a unity government and the end of President Zelensky's political team's grip on power. President Zelensky has revamped his government several times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  In May last year, he fired defence minister Oleksii Reznikov after a series of corruption scandals, and then sacked Kyiv's top commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi earlier this year.  At least five government portfolios, including the infrastructure and agriculture portfolios, have remained vacant since ministers either stepped down or were dismissed earlier this year.  Mr Zelensky's first presidential term was due to end in May 2024, but he remains in his position under martial law.  The reshuffle coincided with Russia's continued bombardment of Ukrainian cities.  On Tuesday, a Russian strike on the central city of Poltava killed 53 people and injured a further 271, while on Wednesday seven people were killed in Ukraine's western city of Lviv."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984g10e22lo,Russia pushes on key Ukraine city while Kyiv's Kursk incursion slows,"Russia is poised to assault Pokrovsk, a crucial supply and reinforcement hub for Ukraine's frontline troops.",31 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:18.681995,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia has made sweeping advances in recent days that threaten to outweigh the gains made by Ukraine in its cross-border attack into the Kursk region. Russian forces are just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub used by the Ukrainian military. Home to a key railway station and major roads, Pokrovsk is an essential supply and reinforcement point for Ukraine’s troops on the eastern front line. Critics in Kyiv fear that the country's military has made a serious miscalculation.  By sending troops into Kursk instead of reinforcing the eastern frontline, the military has left Pokrovsk and other important Ukrainian towns exposed, these critics say. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. On a visit to the front line, Ukraine's armed forces chief Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was throwing “everything that can move” into its assault. “The situation is extremely difficult,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded on Wednesday. “If we lose Pokrovsk,” military expert Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov warned, “the entire front line will crumble."" Pokrovsk is next to another town, Myrnohrad. Together, the two settlements had a pre-war population of over 100,000, most of whom have now fled. They are the last major cities in that part of the Donetsk region that remain under Ukrainian control. The battle for Pokrovsk is really a continuation of the battle for Avdiivka, which Ukraine lost in February after months of bloody fighting. Avdiivka, which is about 40km (25 miles) south-east of Pokrovsk, was seen as a fortress that protected the settlements and roads to its west - helping to bolster Ukraine’s presence along the entire frontline. When it finally fell, Avdiivka was left in ruins. It was a serious loss for Ukraine. It meant that Russia could move its focus to Pokrovsk and the key hilltop town of Chasiv Yar, which overlooks some of the important cities in Donetsk still under Ukrainian control. Intense fighting there on Saturday left five people dead.  For weeks now a mass evacuation of Ukrainian civilians from Pokrovsk has been under way, with thousands said to have left already. Gen Syrskyi said he was working “to strengthen the defence of our troops in the most difficult areas of the front, to provide the brigades with a sufficient amount of ammunition and other material and technical means”. Russia has long held Pokrovsk as one of its key objectives. For months its forces have slowly ground towards it. Experts believe Moscow has deployed around one third of its Central Army Group, or about 30,000 troops, to the offensive - as well as its most battle-ready reserves. This week, it took the Ukrainian town of Novohrodivka, infuriating some in Ukraine who felt it should have been better defended. “The trenches in front of Novohrodivka were empty. There was practically no Ukrainian army in the once 20,000-strong city,” Ukrainian MP Mariana Bezuhla wrote on Facebook. With its forces undermanned and outnumbered, it is believed the Ukrainian military withdrew from Novohrodivka to strengthen its defence of Pokrovsk. ""The Ukrainian command likely deemed the defence of Novohrodivka not worth the potential losses,"" said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Elsewhere, Russian forces have launched assaults on the town of Selidove, just south of Novohrodivka, and other areas of the Donetsk region nearby. The Russian offensive has been helped by a shift in tactics, which are increasingly mirroring those used earlier in the war by the Wagner mercenary group. Ukrainian forces report coming up against wave after wave of Russian infantry sent forwards in an attempt to storm their positions. Some have dubbed these tactics ""meat assaults"".  The tactics - though costly - quickly exhaust Ukrainian units forced to fend off constant attacks. Armoured vehicles are used sparingly - complicating the task of Ukrainian tanks and artillery, which have little to aim at on the battlefield.  Russia has also been using powerful glide bombs, forcing Ukraine to disperse its units when shelling begins and sometimes even withdraw troops from the front line. Meanwhile, the progress of Ukraine’s landmark cross-border offensive has slowed considerably in the past week. Sudzha - the largest settlement Ukraine has captured inside Russia - has a population of around 5,000, which is three times less than that of Novohrodivka, the settlement Russia captured earlier this week. On Tuesday, Ukraine’s commander in chief said that Kyiv's forces had taken 1,294 sq km (500 sq miles) of territory inside Kursk, including 100 settlements - and captured 594 Russian soldiers in the process. These figures should be treated with caution, but they are no doubt significant. The question is whether they will justify the potential losses on Ukraine's eastern frontline. ""One of the objectives of the offensive operation in the Kursk direction was to divert significant enemy forces from other directions, primarily from the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions,” Gen Syrskyi said on Tuesday. But that objective appears to have failed. Russian forces have not been redeployed from the Pokrovsk frontline.  On the contrary they’ve been strengthened by additional troops and their advance has quickened."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewlrxrk5p5o,'Our future is over': Forced to flee by a year of war,The BBC sees first-hand the desperation of Sudanese people affected by the civil war and hunger crisis.,6 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:18.773919,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"On the side of a dirt road in Adré, a key crossing on the Sudan-Chad border, 38-year-old Buthaina sits on the ground, surrounded by other women. Each of them has their children by their side. None seems to have any belongings. Buthaina and her six children fled el-Fasher, a besieged city in the Darfur region of Sudan, more than 480km (300 miles) away, when food and drink ran out. “We left with nothing, we just ran for our lives,” Buthaina tells the BBC. “We didn’t want to leave - my children were top of their class at school and we had a good life at home.” Sudan's civil war began in April last year when the army (SAF) and the their former paramilitary allies, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), began a vicious struggle for power, in part over proposals to move towards civilian rule. The war, which shows no signs of ending, has claimed thousands of lives, displaced millions of people and plunged parts of the country into famine. And aid agencies warn Sudan could soon experience the worst famine of anywhere in the world unless significantly more help arrives. The BBC saw the desperation of Sudanese people first-hand when we visited camps in Adré, on the country’s western border, and Port Sudan, which is the country’s main aid hub, 1,600km away on the east coast. Adré has become a potent symbol of the political failure and humanitarian disaster produced by the current conflict. Until last month, the crossing had been closed since January with only a few aid lorries making it into the country. It has since reopened but aid agencies fear the deliveries now getting in could be too little, too late. Every day, dozens of Sudanese refugees cross the border into Chad - many of them women carrying their hungry and thirsty children on their backs. The moment they arrive, they rush to a water tank set up by the World Food Programme (WFP), one of many UN agencies that have been trying to raise the alarm over the scale of the conflict’s humanitarian impact. After reaching Adré, we make our way to a makeshift camp near the border that has been assembled by refugees, with bits of wood, cloth and plastic. Rain begins to fall. As we leave, it turns torrential and I ask whether the precarious shelters survive the downpours. “They don’t,” says our guide Ying Hu, associate reporting officer from the UNHCR, another UN agency - for refugees.  “With rainfall comes a whole set of diseases,” she adds, “and the worst part is it also means at times it can take days before we can return here by car, because of the flooding, and that means aid can’t reach here either.” Famine has been declared in one area - in Zamzam camp in Darfur - but this is because it is one of the few places in war-torn Sudan the UN has reliable information on. The WFP says it delivered more than 200,000 tonnes of food between April 2023 and July 2024 - far less than needed - but both sides are accused of blocking deliveries into areas under rival control. The RSF and other militias have been accused of stealing and damaging deliveries, while the SAF has been accused of blocking deliveries into areas under RSF control, including most of Darfur.  The BBC approached the RSF and the SAF about the accusations but has not had a response. Both factions have previously denied impeding the delivery of humanitarian relief.  A single convoy of aid trucks can wait six weeks or more in Port Sudan before being cleared by the SAF for onward travel.  On 15 August, the SAF agreed to allow aid agencies to resume shipments via Adré, which should provide much-needed help to the population in Darfur.  In May, Human Rights Watch said ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity have been committed against ethnic Massalit and non-Arab communities in part of Darfur by the RSF and its Arab allies. The RSF rejects this and says it is not involved in what it calls a ""tribal conflict"" in the region. During our tour of Port Sudan we visit a camp for people who have been displaced within Sudan. Walking from tent to tent, we hear one story after another of loss and horror. In one, a group of women sit in a circle, some holding their babies tightly. All of them share stories of abuse, rape and torture in RSF prisons. One of the women, who the BBC is not naming, says she was captured with her two-year-old son as she was fleeing Omdurman, near the capital, Khartoum. “Every day they would take my son to a room down the hallway, and I would hear him cry as they raped me,” she told me. “It happened so frequently that I would try to focus on his cry as they did it.” Also at the camp I meet Safaa, a mother of six who fled Omdurman too. Asked where her husband is, she says he stayed behind because the RSF targets any man who attempts to escape. “Every day my children ask me, 'Where is Baba? When will he come?' But I have not heard from him since January, when we left, and I don’t know if he is still alive,” she says. Asked about what future she envisages for her and her children, she says: “What future? Our future is over - there is nothing left. My children are traumatised. “Every day, my 10-year-old son cries wanting to go home. We went from living in a house, going to school and now we live in a tent.” The BBC approached the RSF for comment about rapes and other attacks but has not had a response. It has previously said reports that its fighters were responsible for widespread abuses were false but where a small number of isolated incidents had occurred their troops had been held accountable. An employee for Unicef - the UN children’s agency - showing us around the camp says those who have arrived here are the “lucky ones”. “They managed to escape the fighting and come here... they have shelter and aid,” he says. The BBC was visiting Adré and Port Sudan with UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohamed and her team of executives, who visited government officials and Sudan’s de-facto president, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, to urge them to keep the Adré crossing open. Her aim is to put Sudan back on the agenda for the international community at a time when the world’s attention is focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. “There is fatigue because there are so many different crises around the world, but that’s just not good enough,” she says. ""You come here and you meet these mothers and their children and you realise they aren’t just numbers. “If the international community doesn’t step up, people will die.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e852r50x7o,Ukraine calls on Mongolia to arrest Putin ahead of visit,"Moscow says it has ""no worries"" about the visit, which is expected to happen next week.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:25.490429,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine has urged Mongolia to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of his visit to the country next week, his first to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member state since the body issued a warrant for his arrest. The court alleges Mr Putin is responsible for war crimes, saying he failed to stop the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia since the conflict began. An ICC spokesperson told the BBC that Mongolian officials ""have the obligation"" to abide by ICC regulations, but clarified that this did not necessarily mean an arrest had to take place.  The Kremlin said it had ""no worries"" about the visit, which is slated to take place next Tuesday.  ""We have an excellent rapport with our partners from Mongolia,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.  ""Of course, all aspects of the president’s visit have been carefully prepared."" Dr Fadi el-Abdallah, a spokesperson for the ICC, told the BBC on Friday that court States Parties - including Mongolia - ""have the obligation to cooperate in accordance with the Chapter IX of the Rome Statute"" - the agreement which set up the court. The agreement says in some circumstances, states may be exempted from the obligation to carry out an arrest where they would be forced to ""breach a treaty obligation"" with another state or where it would violate ""diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third state"".  ""In case of non-cooperation, ICC judges may make a finding to that effect and inform the Assembly of States Parties of it. It is then for the Assembly to take any measure it deems appropriate,"" Dr el-Abdallah said.  The court alleged last year that the Russian president was responsible for war crimes, focusing on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia. It has also issued a warrant for the arrest of Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the same crimes.  It said the crimes were committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022 - when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has previously denied the allegations and labelled the warrants as ""outrageous"". The ICC has no powers to arrest suspects, and can only exercise jurisdiction within its member countries. Ukraine's foreign ministry said it hoped Mongolia was ""aware of the fact that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal"" and called on the country's authorities to arrest the Russian leader and hand him over to prosecutors at The Hague, the seat of the ICC in the Netherlands. The BBC has approached the Mongolian embassy in London for comment.  Last year, Mr Putin cancelled a visit to a summit in South Africa following the ICC warrant for his arrest. As a signatory to the court, South Africa should detain suspects in its territory, but President Ramaphosa warned Russia would see this as a declaration of war. Mr Ramaphosa said the decision for the Russian leader to not attend was ""mutual"". The BBC has contacted the Mongolian Embassy for a comment.

Then there has also been boy bands, awards for people who go above and beyond, Halloween build-up and a special moment for a south Bristol school. Showtime: Live music is on offer pretty much every night of the week in Bristol. This week The Vamps gave their fans a night to remember at the O2 Academy on Tuesday. A team effort: Gloucestershire took the time to recognise the efforts of its whole staff after the players beat rivals Somerset to lift the T20 Blast title at Edgbaston. Once back in Bristol they lined up for this picture at the County Ground. Coming together: Members of the Hong Kong community gathered at Yate Parish Hall to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival with musical performances, lantern making and traditional food and refreshments as part of an event organised by South Gloucestershire Council. Local legends: A special ceremony took place at Aerospace Bristol on Friday night, as 29 people were recognised for going above and beyond to help others at the BBC Radio Bristol Make a Difference Awards.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvp1089q9jo,At least 41 hurt in Russian air strikes on Kharkiv,The regional head accused Moscow of targeting civilians after a supermarket and sports complex were hit.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:25.689608,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russian air strikes have injured at least 41 people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, officials have said. Regional head Oleh Syniehubov said five children were among those wounded and he accused Moscow of ""aiming exclusively at civilian infrastructure"" in the city. Among the buildings damaged are a supermarket and a sports complex in areas residents go to every day, he added. ""Russia is once again terrorizing Kharkiv, striking civilian infrastructure and the city itself,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in the wake of the attacks. Mr Zelensky repeated his calls for Western allies to ""give Ukraine everything it needs to defend itself"". Mr Syniehubov said at least 10 separate Russian strikes had been recorded, including the use of ballistic missiles. People may be buried under the rubble in some areas and rescue operations are continuing, he added. From several videos shared on social media of the attacks, BBC Verify has located one strike to the northeast of the centre of Kharkiv, along Akademika Pavlova St, and another three miles south which damaged the city's Palace of Sport buildings. Images from each attack include the moment of impact and explosion from missiles. The attack comes after Ukraine launched a wave of overnight drone attacks against targets in Russia, where fire broke out at two energy facilities. No injuries or deaths have been reported by Russian officials. According to Russia’s defence ministry, more than 158 Ukrainian drones targeted 15 regions of the country, including the capital Moscow. The Russian military said the drones were intercepted and destroyed.  But as a result of the attack a fire has broken out at an oil refinery in Moscow in a “separate technical room”, the city's mayor said.  Sergei Sobyanin reported that at least 11 drones targeted the capital city and the surrounding areas. Meanwhile, 75 miles (120km) from the Russian capital, in the Tver region, loud blasts were heard close to the Konakovo Power Station.  Russian media are reporting a fire at the facility. The region's governor, Igor Rudenya, acknowledged a fire caused by an attack in Konakovsky district had been contained, without providing details of what was hit. Local officials also said drones attempted to attack the Kashira Power Plant in the Moscow region - but that there were no fires, damage or casualties as a result. BBC Verify has examined and verified videos posted on social media which show explosions at all three locations. In the footage, fires appear to have subsequently broken out at Konakovo Power Station and the Moscow refinery. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. But Ukrainian forces have been stepping up long-range strikes inside Russia over the past few months, launching scores of drones simultaneously at strategic targets several times a week. BBC News has been told that Western technology and finance are helping them carry out hundreds of long-range strikes inside Russia. In Ukraine, a 23-year-old lorry driver was killed after a Russian air strike on a grain convoy in the Sumy region overnight, local officials have said.  Prosecutors said four others were injured in the attack after one lorry caught fire and around 20 others were damaged. Ukraine's air force also said it had destroyed eight out of 11 drones used by Russia, adding that grain and agriculture facilities had been targeted in the Mykolaiv region as well. Sumy borders Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine has been carrying out a military incursion for nearly a month. Progress has slowed in recent days, but Ukraine claimed last week it controlled 1,294 sq km (500 sq miles) of territory - including 100 settlements. It also said nearly 600 Russian soldiers had been captured. Meanwhile, Russian forces are continuing to advance rapidly on a key town in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region - which has been the focus of Moscow's ground offensive for months.  Pokrovsk plays a crucial role as a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, as it is home to a key railway station and is located at the intersection of several important roads. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi described the situation in the area of Russia's main attack as ""difficult"", but added that all necessary decisions are ""being made without delay"". The most recent Ukrainian attacks on Russia's energy facilities also come a day after a Russian guided bomb strike on a playground in Kharkiv killed a 14-year-old girl.  A similar attack on a residential building in the city in north-eastern Ukraine also killed six other people. It also follows Russia hitting Ukraine's energy grid with a massive wave of deadly drone and missile strikes last week – which led to at least nine people being killed over two days. Russia began targeting Ukraine's energy system with air strikes shortly after it began its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

At least six other people were killed and 59 injured as a 12-storey residential building was also hit in the city near the Russian border.  Pictures showed flames and thick black smoke coming from the upper part of the building as firefighters carried people to safety.  President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his calls for all Ukraine's international partners to allow it to hit targets inside Russia in order to prevent such attacks. His office said Moscow's forces had fired more than 400 drones and missiles at Ukraine over the past week. The attack came just hours before Mr Zelensky dismissed the head of his air force, Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, sits around 35km (22 miles) from the Russian border and has been the target of frequent attacks since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.  Regional head Oleh Sinehubov said on Telegram that at least 59 people - including nine children - had been wounded, with 20 in a serious condition and some requiring amputations. Nine children were also injured in the strikes, he said.  Further photos showed part of the building's outer wall collapsed and numerous cars outside it on fire.  Mr Sinehubov said the strikes had been launched from Russia's Belgorod region, which sits just across the border.  ""Let's say unequivocally that there were guidance systems [on the missiles]. We draw one conclusion,"" he said.  ""These streets are exclusively parks with large gatherings of civilians. This is a residential building. This is, again, mass terror against our civilian population."" Mr Zelensky said Russia had targeted ""ordinary"" people and the strikes could have been prevented if Ukraine ""had the capability to destroy Russian military aircraft at their bases"". ""This is an absolutely legitimate need. There is no rational reason to limit Ukraine’s defence,"" he said.  Ukraine's Western allies have partly withheld permission for it to use their weapons to strike Russian territory for fear of escalating the conflict.  The UK has allowed much of the equipment it has supplied to be used to hit Russia, though maintains an exception for long-range Storm Shadow missiles. In May, the US allowed Ukraine to hit targets inside Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region and only to ""hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them"". It continues to refuse permission for strikes deeper into Russian territory.  ""We need long-range capabilities and the full implementation of air defence agreements for Ukraine. These are life-saving measures,” Mr Zelensky said.  Responding to Friday's attacks, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, said: ""Our thoughts are with the people of Kharkiv as rescue operations are under way. ""Russia must be held accountable for these war crimes."" Earlier this week, numerous sources told the BBC that Western technology and finance was helping Ukraine carry out hundreds of long-range strikes in Russia using Ukrainian-produced drones.  The targets included air force bases, oil and ammunition depots and command centres. Elsewhere, Russian officials said five people were killed by Ukrainian strikes in the western Belgorod region.  Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a further 37 civilians were wounded in the strikes, which he said were caused by the use of ""cluster munitions"" by Ukrainian forces. "

Julian Gao, Ruby Hamill, Daniel Jones and Sayed Shah are all accused of damaging Teledyne's factory in Shipley, which specialises in supplying electronics to the aerospace and defence sectors.  At the start of their trial at Bradford Crown Court on Tuesday, prosecutor Gerald Hendron said the four had ""caused extensive damage"" during the protest on 2 April. The defendants are charged with damaging property and having articles with intent to destroy or damage property, including but not limited to crowbars and sledgehammers. The prosecution told Bradford Crown Court that at 05:30 BST on the morning of the protest, the four defendants used angle grinders which caused ""sparks"" as they cut through the gate to Teledyne's Shipley site. They were then said to have gained access to the roof of the building using a ladder.  The jury was shown video footage of four people at the site, who the prosecution said were the defendants. Mr Hendron said: ""The footage shows the defendants cutting their way through the fence and climbing onto the roof."" The four defendants were seen to be laughing to each other in court as the footage was played to the jury. According to the prosecution, more footage seen by the jury showed Mr Jones, of Rossett Road, Crosby, Sefton, and Miss Hamill, of Emu Road in London, Wandsworth, smashing a window to the building. Meanwhile, further footage was shown, which the prosecution said depicted Mr Jones holding a sledgehammer tied to a rope down a hole in the roof and swinging it from side to side. Another video was shown to the jury of Mr Gao, of Dalton Ellis Hall, Manchester, speaking in front of a Palestinian flag following the incident.   In the video, he said: ""Britain has the ability to stop this genocide. If they won't do it, we will."" He explained the protesters' goal was to have ""no more British weapons in the hands of Israeli soldiers"". Mr Gao warned ""imperialists and oppressors"" that ""you are not safe"" and ""your days are numbered"". The jury also saw footage of another man, who the prosecution said was Mr Shah, of Reedley Road, Reedley, Burnley, saying: ""You look so upset about some tiles, man. The whole of Gaza is being carpet-bombed."" Mr Hendron told the court that Teledyne ""provided components for the defence and aerospace industries"". He added that ""through British arms export licences"", those components were used ""by countries including Ukraine and Israel"". The prosecution said the defendants were on the roof of the Teledyne factory in Shipley for about 14 hours and caused £571,383 worth of damage. Mr Hendron told the jury: ""The defendants gave 'no comment' answers when questioned by police."" The trial continues.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4yg0k976lo,Russian fighters to leave Burkina Faso for Ukraine,"The Russian mercenaries were helping Burkina Faso fight Islamist insurgents, who recently staged a huge attack.",30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:25.978108,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia is withdrawing 100 of its paramilitary officers from Burkina Faso to help in the war in Ukraine.   They are part of about 300 soldiers from the Bear Brigade - a Russian private military company - who arrived in the West African nation in May to support the country's military junta.  On its Telegram channel, the group said its forces would return home to support Russia’s defence against Ukraine’s recent offensive in the Kursk region.  There are fears the pull-out could embolden Islamist insurgents in Burkina Faso, who recently killed up to 300 people in one of the biggest attacks in years. Burkina Faso has since 2015 suffered regular jihadist attacks, with more than two million people displaced in what aid groups call the world’s “most neglected” crisis. The junta under interim President Capt Ibrahim Traoré, who came to power in a coup in September 2022, promised to end the attacks but has struggled, even after seeking new security partnerships with Russia.  With nearly half the country outside government control, jihadist groups are increasingly targeting civilians and military units. Survivors say up to 300 people were killed on Saturday in the northern town of  Barsalogho, in an attack which was claimed by an al-Qaeda-linked armed group, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). They were reportedly both civilians and military personnel helping to dig trenches to help protect the town against jihadist attacks. The authorities have not said how many people were killed but Communication Minister Rimtalba Jean Emmanuel Ouedraogo called the attack “barbaric”. The Bear Brigade is said to be responsible for guarding senior Burkinabè officials, including Capt Traoré, whose leadership has been threatened before.   They arrived in the same month when gunshots were fired in the Burkinabè capital near the presidential palace, heightening speculation about growing opposition to the junta leader, who claimed to have thwarted a coup attempt last year. Videos which circulated on social media and reportedly confirmed by the group showed the Burkinabè military leader being guarded by men in uniforms featuring Russian flags. The group says it is guarding the Russian ambassador in Ouagadougou, the Burkina Faso capital. About 100 members of this specialised unit are set to leave the West African country, only three months after arriving.  Their sudden departure is linked to the recent Ukrainian offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.  ""When the enemy arrives on our Russian territory, all Russian soldiers forget about internal problems and unite against a common enemy,"" Bears Brigade commander Viktor Yermolaev told France's Le Monde newspaper (in French).  On Tuesday, the group posted on its Telegram channel that the unit was returning to its base in Russian-occupied Crimea ""in connection with recent events."" It is not clear how the Burkina Faso junta plans to compensate for the loss of military support after the partial withdrawal of the Bear Brigade.  Burkina's Faso, like its neighbours, Mali and Niger, is battling various Islamist groups, which operate in the semi-arid Sahel region, south of the Sahara Desert. The military has seized power in all three countries, and formed the Alliance of Sahel States.  They have cut ties with former colonial power France and befriended Russia instead, buying weapons and deploying fighters with the mercenary Wagner Group, now known as the Africa Corps. However, armed groups have stepped up their attacks, particularly in Burkina Faso, despite massive recruitment by the paramilitary Volunteers for the Defence of the Homeland, a self-defence militia.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6240qepyppo,Ukraine's long-range drones using Western tech to hit Russia,Western technology and finance are helping Ukraine carry out hundreds of long-range strikes inside Russia.,29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:26.074302,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Western technology and finance are helping Ukraine carry out hundreds of long-range strikes inside Russia. That is despite Nato allies still refusing to give Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied munitions to do so – mostly because of fears of escalation. Ukraine has been stepping up its long-range strikes inside Russia over the past few months, launching scores of drones simultaneously at strategic targets several times a week.  The targets include air force bases, oil and ammunition depots and command centres. Ukrainian firms are now producing hundreds of armed one-way attack drones a month, at a fraction of the cost it takes to produce a similar drone in the West.  One company told the BBC it was already creating a disproportionate impact on Russia’s war economy at a relatively small expense. The BBC has been briefed by a number of those involved in these missions. They include one of Ukraine’s largest one-way attack drone manufacturers, as well as a big data company which has helped develop software for Ukraine to carry out these strikes. Francisco Serra-Martins says the strategy is already creating huge dilemmas for Moscow. He believes that with extra investment, it will turn the tide of the war in Ukraine’s favour. Eighteen months ago, the company he co-founded, Terminal Autonomy, didn’t even exist. It is now producing more than a hundred AQ400 Scythe long-range drones a month, with a range of 750km (465 miles). The company also makes hundreds of  shorter range AQ100 Bayonet drones a month, which can fly a few hundred kilometres. The drones are made of wood and are being assembled in former furniture factories in Ukraine. Mr Serra-Martins, a former Australian Army Royal Engineer, set up the company with his Ukrainian co-founder, backed by US finance. It is one of at least three companies now producing drones in Ukraine at scale. He describes his drones as “basically flying furniture – we assemble it like Ikea”. It takes about an hour to build the fuselage and half that time to put the brains inside it – the electronics, motor and explosives. The company’s Bayonet drone costs a few thousand dollars. In contrast, a Russian air defence missile used to shoot it down can cost more than $1m.      It is not only cheap drones making the difference.  Palantir, a large US data analysis company,  was one of the first Western tech companies to aid Ukraine’s war effort. It started by providing software to improve the speed and accuracy of its artillery strikes. Now it has given Ukraine new tools  to plan its long-range drone strikes. British engineers from Palantir, working with Ukrainian counterparts, have designed a programme to generate and map the best ways to reach a target. Palantir makes clear it is not involved in the missions, but has helped train more than 1,000 Ukrainians how to use its software. The BBC has been shown how it works in principle. Using streams of data, it can map Russia’s air defences, radar and electronic jammers. The end product looks similar to a topographical chart. The tighter the contours, the heavier the air defences. The locations have already  been identified by Ukraine using commercial satellite imagery and signals intelligence. Louis Mosley of Palantir says the programme is helping Ukraine to skirt around Russia’s electronic warfare and air defence systems to reach their target. “Understanding and visualising what that looks like across the entire battle space is really critical to optimising these missions,” he says. The execution of the long-range drone strikes is being co-ordinated by Ukraine’s intelligence agencies, who work in secrecy. But the BBC has been told by other sources about some of the detail.   Scores of drones can be fired for any one mission – as many as 60 at one target. The attacks are mostly carried out at night. Most will be shot down. As few as 10% may reach the target. Some drones are even shot down along the way by friendly fire - Ukraine’s own air defences. Ukraine has had to work out ways to counter Russian electronic jamming. Terminal Autonomy’s Scythe drone uses visual positioning – navigating its course and examining the terrain by Artificial Intelligence. There is no pilot involved. Palantir software will have already mapped the best routes. Mr Serra-Martins says flying a lot of drones is key to overwhelming and exhausting Russia’s air defences.  So too is making the drones cheaper than the missiles trying to shoot them down, or the targets they are trying to hit. Prof Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine’s long-range drone attacks  are creating dilemmas for Moscow. Although Russia has a lot of air defences, it still cannot protect everything. Prof Bronk says Ukraine’s long-range strikes are showing ordinary Russians that “the state can’t defend them fully and that Russia is vulnerable”.  Ukrainian drones have been spotted more than 1,000km (620 miles) inside Russia. They have been shot down over Moscow.  But the focus has been on military sites. The map below highlights just a handful of the dozen targets hit over the past few months. They include five Russian airbases. Prof Justin Bronk says targeting Russian airbases has so far been the only effective way Ukraine has to respond to Russia’s glide bombs.  It has forced Russia to move aircraft to bases further away and reduce the frequency of their attacks. Satellite imagery shows how Ukrainian drones have successfully damaged hangars at its Marinovka airbase. Ukraine clearly believes it could do even more with the help of Western-made long-range weapons. But so far, allies have rejected Kyiv’s pleas.  There is still a lingering fear, especially in Washington and Berlin, that it could drag the West further into the conflict. But that hasn’t stopped Western companies and finance from helping Ukraine. Ukraine is still largely having to rely on its home-grown efforts, convinced that bringing the war to Russia is a key to winning this war. Francisco Serra-Martins also believes Western manufacturers are still “woefully unprepared” to fight high-intensity warfare – producing far fewer long-range weapons at a much higher cost. He says what Ukraine really needs now “is a lot of good enough systems”.  The BBC has talked to one Ukrainian company which is already developing a new cruise missile, at least 10 times cheaper than a British-made Storm Shadow missile.  Despite the West’s misgivings, Ukraine is planning to step up its attacks on Russia. Mr Serra-Martins says: “What you’re seeing now is like nothing compared to what you’ll see by the end of the year."""

Three-year-old Yuna, who has shell shock, arrived at The Big Cat Sanctuary in Smarden on 17 August and stayed inside her enclosure for a week.  But the sanctuary, which said she had previously been confined to a small space on a concrete floor, said she had ""begun to reveal a playful and curious nature"". This involved venturing to the outside of her enclosure, feeling grass beneath her paws for the first time and scratching trees and logs.  Yuna was traumatised when debris from a missile attack landed 300m (984ft) from the small enclosure. She was discovered and taken to Wild Animal Rescue near Kyiv, a facility supported by the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The sanctuary said before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, she had been kept at a private home. Rori, a male lion, is currently in Belgium and will join the sanctuary when a specially built enclosure is completed in November. Cam Whitnall, from The Big Cat Sanctuary, said staff had been ""chatting"" to Yuna to help her feel comfortable at her new home. ""She comes out for a few hours each day now, but we're monitoring her because she's still very wobbly,"" he said. He added that other activities Yuna had taken up included play fighting plants and bark, and being bewildered by rain, having not previously had access to an outdoor enclosure. The sanctuary is aiming to raise £500,000 to complete the facility to be able to eventually bring a total of five lions from Kyiv to Kent. Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywj08d89no,"He lost his legs in the war, now he’s Ukraine’s most desirable man",So many women applied to appear beside Oleksandr Budko on The Bachelor that the show's website crashed.,24 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:26.281803,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When a shell exploded near Oleksandr Budko, the 26-year-old found himself buried alive and in ""terrible pain"" from injuries that would lead to the amputation of both his legs. The Ukrainian soldier was helping to defend the north-eastern Kharkiv region from invading Russian forces in August 2022, when his unit was attacked. Two years on, he’s the star of a reality TV show in which multiple women battle for his affection. One advert for the Ukrainian version of hit US series The Bachelor shows a smartly-dressed Oleksandr staring wistfully at a flower. In another, he answers questions in military fatigues before performing a series of pull-ups in a gym. Speaking to me in a rose garden in Kyiv, the veteran-turned-celebrity is in good spirits despite being tired after a busy week. Oleksandr says he’s hoping to find love on the show after breaking up with his girlfriend last January - but thinks it will be difficult to choose a partner with “millions of people watching”. His motivations aren’t just romantic. He also wants to use his appearance on the show to raise awareness of the challenges facing disabled Ukrainians. “This show is watched by millions of people, and it presents a huge opportunity to positively influence their outlook,” he says. He wants to show that injured veterans are not “outsiders, but full members of society who are living a good life. “In my case, my life is now even better than before the war, better than before I got injured.” Oleksandr is always on the go, telling me he spent the previous night filming a music video. His life wasn’t always like this. In the years before Russia's full-scale invasion, he was working as a barista in a Kyiv restaurant while studying graphic design. He says his dreams were “down to earth”: travelling, discovering the world, and growing professionally. He wanted to start a family. But Oleksandr’s life was turned upside down two years ago, when he became one of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men to join the army. In August 2022, he was stationed near Izyum, an occupied city on the front lines of the Russian advance. It was invaded in the early days of the war and used by Russia as a key military hub to supply its forces from the east. The city was liberated by Kyiv just a month after Oleksandr was seriously injured while defending the nearby Ukrainian position. ""I felt the earth shift onto me. I felt a terrible pain in my legs and realised that it would mean the amputation of my legs,"" he said. ""I screamed from horrific pain and shouted for people to hear me.” He says he knew his comrades were alive, and they dug him out of the ground and provided first aid. But that’s when he knew his legs were badly hurt. ""I understood that I had lost my legs at the moment of injury, two or three seconds after I felt the pain.” Oleksandr survived but much of Izyum was left in ruins. At the time, authorities said they had found more than 400 bodies in graves near the city. Despite a challenging recovery, Oleksandr was able to walk with prosthetic legs within six months. “When I didn't have prostheses, I had to move around in a wheelchair. I discovered how inaccessible and unsuited Kyiv was for wheelchair users, even though it’s the capital city,” he says. “In the historic old town you can’t go anywhere. You can’t cross the road on your own and you can’t go inside any building because there are stairs everywhere.” War injuries mean Oleksandr’s experience is becoming increasingly common in Ukraine. While there’s no official data recording the number of people injured during the war, tens of thousands are estimated to have lost limbs. This has resulted in the creation of a separate reality show, called Legs Off - which Oleksandr presented - capturing the difficulties faced by disabled people as they move around Ukrainian cities. As well as presenting, the veteran has also written a book, won medals at the Invictus Games, and performed with a ballet troupe in the US – all while recovering from his injuries. He’s so popular in Ukraine that The Bachelor’s application portal crashed shortly after it was announced Oleksandr would take on the main role in the upcoming season. Producers of The Bachelor are casting the veteran as a symbol of hope. “Despite his amputations, Oleksandr rides a bike, drives a car, and climbs mountains. He lives life to the fullest,"" says Natalia Franchuk, from STB, the network on which the show will air later this year. “If television is about filming reality, then who better could be the star of The Bachelor now? Who else would be better suited in a country at war?”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y1e4jpz3o,Scottish government confirms £500m in cuts,Finance Secretary Shona Robison says the government is facing almost £1bn in additional costs.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.302970,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Scotland's Finance Secretary Shona Robison has announced up to £500m of cuts to balance the government's budget. Ms Robison told parliament the country was facing ""enormous and growing"" financial pressure, including additional costs of £800m in this financial year.  She cited public sector pay deals, ""prolonged"" Westminster austerity, inflation, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. As well as direct cuts, including to mental health services, the government will reallocate up to £460m raised in an auction of seabed plots for offshore projects - cash that was previously earmarked to tackle the climate crisis.  The finance secretary, who announced a total of £933m in measures to balance the budget, told parliament: ""We cannot ignore the severe financial challenges we face.  ""We will continue to be a fiscally responsible government and balance the budget each year - as we have done every year for 17 years and we will do again this year. “But this will mean we must unfortunately take difficult decisions along the way.” Opposition figures pointed to a Scottish Fiscal Commission report that found much of the financial pressure on the public purse “comes from the Scottish government’s own decisions”. Ms Robison told MSPs £188m would be cut across government departments – including a reduction in spend on sustainable and active travel, and increased interest income on Scottish Water loan balances. In the annex of a letter from Ms Robison to the finance committee, it was revealed that £116m of the cuts will come from the health budget, including an £18.8m reduction in mental health services. Outlay on transport is to be cut by £23.7m, while net zero and energy spending is reduced by £23.4m, with social justice down by £15.7m. The Scottish government introduced emergency curbs on all ""non-essential"" spending last month, including a recruitment freeze. It said cost-cutting measures were necessary amid pay negotiations involving council workers, doctors, train drivers, nurses and teachers. Ministers had already announced they would implement means-tested winter fuel payments, reintroduce peak rail fares, scrap free bus travel for people in the asylum system and delay a digital devices programme. In addition to these measures, Ms Robison vowed the government would “maximise efficiencies” in public bodies. She said she would look to extend a recruitment freeze to public bodies, while ""ensuring that frontline services in the like of our NHS, police and fire can recruit the staff they need"".  The finance secretary also signalled cuts in the public sector workforce, noting that it was larger relative to other UK nations and telling MSPs it would need to “evolve”. Ms Robison said up to £60m will be saved through emergency spending controls imposed on government departments, particularly those relating to recruitment, overtime, travel and marketing. A further £65m is to be saved by reintroducing peak rail fares, axing concessionary travel for asylum seekers and allowing local authorities to finance pay deals by drawing on funds from existing programmes - such as flood defences and providing digital devices for children.  The government will also divert £160m previously earmarked for winter fuel payments. Ms Robison confirmed ministers would draw down up to £460m from the ScotWind leasing auction of seabed plots for major offshore wind projects - which raised more than £700m in 2022. At the time, the government pledged the funds would be used to “help tackle the twin climate and biodiversity crises”. Ms Robison said public pay was a “significant driver” of the in-year financial pressures but warned it “remains to be seen” whether the UK government would fund deals in line with recommendations from pay review bodies. The Scottish government spends more than half of its day-to-day budget on public sector pay. For 2024-25, it budgeted for a 3% increase, insisting that was all it could afford. But it is now reallocating cash from its in-year budget to fund offers of more than 3%. Council workers have been offered a pay rise of 3.6% - or £1,292 per year if that is higher. That has been rejected by the country’s largest union, meaning the government may have to find additional funds if it wants to avert strikes. ScotRail train drivers have been offered an increase of 4.5%, while NHS staff - including nurses, midwives, paramedics, allied health professionals and porters – have been offered a 5.5% pay rise, which would cost £448m. The government also set aside £29m to fund a pay proposal to teachers, who have been offered a uniform 4.27% uplift. Ms Robison’s announcement comes the day before First Minister John Swinney is due to unveil his first Programme for Government, setting out his administration’s policy goals. In his keynote speech to the SNP conference last weekend, Mr Swinney said the government needed to work ""smarter and harder"", but denied the party was imposing austerity. The Scottish government will announce more comprehensive spending plans for 2025-26 in its budget, which Ms Robison aims to announced on 4 December.  Ministers have warned they face uncertainty until the new UK Labour government announces its first budget next month. SNP ministers do expect to receive more money from the Treasury, but they do not anticipate it will be enough to cover Holyrood’s spending commitments. The UK Labour government has said it will make ""tough decisions"" to address a £22bn hole in public finances left by the previous government – a claim that is disputed by the Conservatives. Ms Robison said: ""While it is welcome that the new UK government has accepted the diagnosis that we have given for years on the UK’s public finances, their solution is sadly looking like an extension of the folly of austerity.” Scottish Conservative finance spokesperson Liz Smith cited a Scottish Fiscal Commission report that found the SNP government's own decisions are to blame for ""much of the pressure"" facing the country's finances. As well as highlighting “significant uncertainty” about UK government funding for Holyrood, the report said a council tax freeze, more generous public sector pay deals than in other parts of the UK and social security reforms had all “added to the in-year pressures”. Ms Smith urged the finance secretary to accept the “black hole” in this year’s financial budget was the “result of the actions of the Scottish government and not the actions of Westminster”. Labour finance spokesperson Michael Marra said the ScotWind funds were “lost now into the black hole"" rather than being invested in the country's future.  He blamed the cuts on “SNP incompetence”, adding: “Scots are left paying more and getting less."" It's important to note that the budget black hole being talked about today is not the same as the black hole the IFS was warning about ahead of the election - that was about future spending. The cuts being announced today are to deal with in-year spending. The Scottish government must, by law, balance its books and Shona Robison has set out how she intends to do that. With salaries making up more than half of the government's costs, the price tag for public sector salary increases is one of the key issues to be addressed. The Scottish Fiscal Commission also points to other policy choices like funding a council tax freeze and higher levels of social security spending. For its part, the Scottish government blames Westminster austerity, the impact of Brexit and a reckless mini budget for its financial challenges."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07e0m9r35jo,Russian activist speaks out in spy case after prisoner swap,Zhanna Nemtsova says her suspicions were confirmed when Spanish reporter Pablo González returned to Moscow in a prisoner swap.,1 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.395754,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"In early August, Pablo González was taken from a prison in Poland and flown to Moscow on a plane carrying Russian deep-cover agents, hackers and a hitman for the FSB intelligence service. The group was met at the airport by a military guard, red carpet and Vladimir Putin – thanking them for their loyal service to the country. Video footage from that night in Moscow shows Mr González smiling as he shakes hands with President Putin at the foot of the plane steps. Black-bearded, with a shaven and shiny head, he’s wearing a Star Wars T-shirt that declares “Your Empire Needs You”. Known by his Russian friends as “Pablo, the Basque journalist”, the 42-year-old was part of a major prisoner swap for Westerners held in Russian jails and Russian dissidents. In the group freed by Vladimir Putin were two opposition activists Mr González was accused of spying on. He’d been arrested in Poland in 2022 for alleged espionage. “I got my first suspicions in 2019. It just dawned on me,” Zhanna Nemtsova tells me, in the first interview she’s given about the man who spied on her. The two met in 2016 at an event about the investigation into her father’s murder. Boris Nemtsov, a staunch opponent of Vladimir Putin, had been assassinated a year earlier, right beside the Kremlin. His daughter - herself a vocal Putin critic – eventually moved to Europe for safety. That day in Strasbourg, Pablo González asked Ms Nemtsova for an interview for a newspaper in the Basque region. She refused, at first. But the journalist – Spanish, with Russian roots – gradually became something of a fixture in her circle: attending events, taping interviews, mingling. Looking back, Ms Nemtsova remembers becoming wary. “I shared my suspicions with a couple of people and they were like, ‘No, this is nonsense!’ People regard you as crazy if you bring up some things. They can think you paranoid. “But I was absolutely right.” That’s why she’s decided to speak out openly now. “I want other people to be very careful,” Zhanna Nemtsova explains. “The threat is not something you can just read in books or watch at the movies. It’s very close.” Mr González was only formally charged with espionage a week after he left Poland, flown to Moscow as part of the August prisoner swap. By then, he’d spent well over two years locked up, awaiting trial. All along, Polish prosecutors have deflected questions about the case and the process. Intelligence sources remain tight-lipped. The Polish lawyer who first represented Mr González says he can’t comment. By the time of his arrest, Mr González had been living in Warsaw for at least three years, much of that time with his Polish girlfriend. He was a freelance journalist, working mostly for Spanish-language press. He reported from the war in Nagorno-Karabakh and travelled to Ukraine. At some point, he joined a media trip to Syria run by the Russian defence ministry, always very selective about who it takes. It was in 2022 that he was detained, briefly, in Ukraine, though the SBU security service there won’t divulge any details. Then, on 28 February, Mr González was arrested in Przemysl, eastern Poland, where he was part of the media pack covering the start of Russia’s all-out war on Ukraine. The trigger for the arrest has not been made public. Last year, Zhanna Nemtsova was shown evidence of Mr González’s activity as part of the criminal investigation. “I have no doubt he was a spy. I am sure, 100%,” she told me this week. Ms Nemtsova is banned by a non-disclosure agreement from sharing details of the evidence. As a result, she’s had to watch people continue to profess that Mr González is innocent. “It’s scary. We shouldn’t downplay this. These people have no moral scruples. They regard you as their enemies,” she warns, referring to Russian intelligence agents. Although Ms Nemtsova says she never trusted Mr González as a true friend, he did manage to insert himself into her circle. He was informing on the group from the start, she says. “He can be very charming, he knows how to communicate with people, make them feel at ease.” Her ex-husband, Pavel Elizarov, agrees. He and Mr González were “quite close for some period of time”. He would visit him in Spain, talk politics and do tourism. He introduced others to his friend. Ilya Yashin, another prominent activist, went to a football match with Mr González in Spain and even coat shopping. When Mr González was released in the prisoner swap, Mr Yashin was one of the trades: he’d been imprisoned in Russia for condemning the war on Ukraine. Vadim Prokhorov, the Nemtsov family lawyer, recalls another detail. “He drank like a Russian,” Mr Prokhorov told me. “He could hold his drink without falling over. We should have suspected him back then!” We did ask to interview Mr González via his wife, who lives in Spain and has been his most avid supporter. So far, he hasn’t replied. Instead, he appeared on Kremlin-controlled television, filmed wandering through a Moscow suburb, reminiscing in perfect Russian about sledging on cardboard as a child. He was born, he explains, Pavel Rubtsov – still the name in his Russian passport. He became Pablo González when he moved to Spain with his mother in 1991. His grandfather had been evacuated to the USSR during the Spanish Civil War, so Pavel and his mother were entitled to Spanish citizenship. It all made him ideal recruitment material for Russian intelligence, but the state TV report declared that Poland had no evidence of that. “They threatened and pressured me,” Mr González says, in his extremely deep voice. “I asked, ‘What did I do?’ and they said, ‘You know.’ But I didn’t.” No-one I’ve interviewed has characterised Mr González as a Putin fan, although Zhanna Nemtsova says she and he were on “different sides of the political spectrum”. “I didn’t get any pro-Russian vibe off him,” a Polish contact said. But on Russian TV, Mr González is quite clearly excited as he describes meeting “Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin” at Vnukovo airport in Moscow. Coming down the plane steps, he says, he was “practising” all the way how to greet his president. “I wanted to be sure it was a strong, manly handshake,” Mr González explains, with a big grin. The BBC has not had direct access to any of the material in this case. But we have interviewed reliable sources whose accounts, taken together, reveal that Pablo González was informing on a number of people in Europe. When he was detained, Polish investigators discovered reports detailing the movements, contacts and profiles of people ranging over several years. Russian opposition activists were one target, including those close to Zhanna Nemtsova. There’s a report on at least one Polish citizen, as well as students of a journalism summer school run by Ms Nemtsova. Investigators also found emails that Mr González had copied from a laptop he had been lent. We don’t know who these reports were sent to, but they list expenses incurred in gathering information, including transport costs. “There were a lot of details, including what they ate for lunch,” the BBC was told. In some cases, that source says, questions have been added, apparently by a superior seeking clarification or more detail. One of the reports concerns the Russian defence ministry press trip to Syria that Mr González went on, though its main focus is to criticise the ministry for poor organisation of the tour. The official charge sheet accuses Mr González of espionage - namely, providing intelligence, spreading disinformation and “conducting operational reconnaissance” for Russian military intelligence, the GRU. We don’t know what other evidence there might be, but the value of what he gathered on the Russian opposition is unclear. I was told that some reports are “sloppy” and include information taken from the internet. “Some were really wordy, with 10 pages instead of one. Probably to get more funding,” the source thought. The first part matches the comments of a close friend of Mr González who told me he was “a bit lazy”. The BBC also understands that the accuracy of the reports deteriorates notably after 2018, with fewer notes or corrections by a senior officer, or handler. It may be coincidental, but that’s when large numbers of Russian intelligence assets were expelled from Europe, after double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in the British city of Salisbury. And although Russian activists who socialised with “Pablo, the Basque journalist” were shocked to learn he’d betrayed them, they doubt he had access to sensitive information. “We are not in the habit of sharing this information with anyone, as we’ve always known we could face such problems,” Zhanna Nemtsova confirms. “Everything we said to him, we’d say to anyone else in public,” opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza told me after his release as part of the same prisoner swap. One source sought to downplay the case against Mr González, describing the contents of the reports as ""not serious"". But Ms Nemtsova – whose father was murdered in Moscow for his politics – strongly disagrees. “His words were important for the GRU [Russian military intelligence]. They might have led to serious consequences. This does not suggest that Pablo himself would do some damage. But they have other people who do this. “That’s why this is serious.” When Mr González was detained, there was a flurry of protest over accusing a journalist of espionage. The EU had significant concerns about the rule of law under the previous Polish government, while groups such as Reporters Without Borders called for Mr González to be brought to trial, allowed to defend himself against any evidence, or be set free. “I thought maybe they were mistaken about the arrest,” a Polish journalist who knew Mr González remembers his own initial doubts. “I thought maybe it was just to show the government were doing stuff about Russia.” As Mr González was never convicted, his staunchest supporters still argue that Poland has “got away” with an injustice. But most were silenced by last month’s prisoner swap and the ceremonial welcome in Moscow. The government in Madrid has been notably quiet on the case, in public, from the start. “But that prisoner exchange, and González’s reception, are the reply to everything,” one official there told me. As she put it, it would be very odd for Vladimir Putin – crusher of the free media – to “save” a mere journalist. Weeks after Mr González was returned to Moscow, the spy scandal is still causing headaches for Ms Nemtsova. In 2018 and 2019, the foundation she set up after her father’s killing invited “Pablo, the Basque journalist” to Prague to give a lecture on war reporting. The summer school for young journalists was hosted by Charles University. Now Czech media have declared that academia has been “infiltrated”, prompting a PhD student to write a dramatic letter to the university Arts Faculty, warning that the Nemtsov Foundation may pose a security threat “to the entire Czech Republic”. The student, Aliaksandr Parshankou, suggested suspending a Russian Studies MA, supported by Ms Nemtsova’s group,  pending an investigation. He told the BBC the course was “by definition a point of attraction for Putin” and called for it to  carry a warning that the safety of students “cannot be guaranteed”. Ms Nemtsova calls the student’s claims “groundless and manipulative” and he admits he has no actual evidence. But the foundation is part of the legacy of Ms Nemtsova’s father and she fears the aim is to “kick us out of the faculty”.  “I am a victim of espionage,” she protested. “It can happen to people like me, but that doesn’t mean we represent a threat to the Czech Republic.” Pablo González was flown back to Moscow by Russia, where his passport identifies him as Pavel Rubtsov. Spain does not deprive people of citizenship, even those suspected of espionage. But Mr González would have to reapply for his Spanish passport. The chances of him heading there seem slim while there’s a case for espionage open in the EU. It’s unclear how long that case might be left pending. As for visiting his sons there, an official in Madrid was clear: “They are free to go and see him in Moscow.” Once an intelligence agent is unmasked, their career options and movements are limited. Other Russians who’ve followed a similar path have ended up starring on state-controlled TV. Perhaps Pablo will restyle himself as Pavel, and find himself praising Vladimir Putin a lot more. As for Zhanna Nemtsova, she admits she’s even more cautious about who she deals with. “Now I always think about security,” she told me. “I did think about my security before, because I left Russia. But I didn’t think about security in Europe. Now of course, I do. And I am careful.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m0jvd4m3zo,Zelensky sacks Ukraine air force chief after F-16 crash,The move came four days after an F-16 fighter jet from Nato allies went down during a Russian barrage.,31 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.496029,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"President Volodymyr Zelensky has sacked the commander of Ukraine's air force amid debate over the destruction of one of the country's valuable new F-16 fighter jets.  Mr Zelensky did not specify the reason for dismissing Lt Gen Mykola Oleshchuk, but said he had a responsibility to ""take care of all our warriors"".  The US-made F-16 - one of several delivered earlier this month by Ukraine's Western allies - went down on Monday, killing the pilot.  Even though it happened during a barrage of Russian missiles, Ukraine said the cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy strike, and Lt Gen Oleshchuk sparred with some politicians over who was to blame for the loss. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has seized a large part of territory in the east of the country. But Ukraine also launched a surprise incursion into Russia's western Kursk region early this month - and says its troops have been advancing deeper into Russia. In response, Russia has intensified its attacks across Ukraine.  On Friday, a 14-year-old girl was killed after a Russian guided bomb hit a playground in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials say. At least six other people were killed and 59 injured as a 12-storey residential building was also hit in the city which is close to the Russian border. President Zelensky renewed his calls for all Ukraine's international partners to allow it to hit targets inside Russia to prevent such attacks.  His office said Moscow's forces had fired more than 400 drones and missiles at Ukraine over the past week. In a post on Telegram, Mr Zelensky said he had decided to replace Lt Gen Oleschuk, noting that ""at the command level, we must strengthen ourselves and protect our people"".  Ukraine's air force earlier named the killed pilot as Col Oleksiy Mes.  ""He fought heroically his last battle in the skies,"" it said, adding that he had shot down three cruise missiles and a drone on 26 August. Col Mes, whose call sign was Moonfish, was one of Ukraine's most experienced pilots. He had been trained abroad for F-16 missions. Lt Gen Anatolii Kryvonozhko was appointed interim commander of Ukraine's air force, the army's general staff said in a statement. He previously oversaw the central air command, leading operations in the centre of the country.  He takes charge as officials have clashed over the loss of the F-16 jet, which has ignited fierce debate in Ukraine.  Ukrainian politician Mariana Bezuhla, who sits on a parliamentary defence committee, claimed on Thursday that the jet was downed by Ukraine's Patriot air defence system.  Mr Oleshchuk responded earlier on Friday that an investigation was under way and no-one was hiding anything. He accused Ms Bezuhla of discrediting military leadership and said the time would come for an apology.  Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023. Mr Zelensky has dismissed several military commanders since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.  In February this year, he sacked the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.  And in June, he dismissed Lt Gen Yuriy Sodol after public criticism of excessive casualties and accusations of incompetence."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2np2l5mlko,UK defends partial Israel arm sales ban,"Defence Secretary John Healey responds to criticism by saying the UK remains a ""staunch ally"" of Israel.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.592202,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The UK has defended its decision to suspend some arms sales to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the decision ""shameful"", saying on social media that it ""will only embolden Hamas"". But Husam Zomlot, the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, called the partial ban an “important first step” to the UK’s fulfilment of its “legal obligations under domestic and international law”. On Monday, the UK suspended around 30 out of 350 weapons export licences to Israel.  But Defence Secretary John Healey insisted the UK remained a ""staunch ally"" of Israel, telling the BBC Israel's security would not be weakened by the decision. Government ministers say the weapons could be used in Gaza to violate international law.  Human rights group Amnesty International UK said the measures were ""too limited"".  Others have criticised the timing of the announcement for coming on the same day funerals took place for six hostages killed by Hamas last week. Mr Healey told BBC Breakfast it was ""agonising"" seeing the faces of the dead hostages, but said the timing was ""driven by the fact that this was a legal process"" and the need to report to Parliament. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday the UK would be suspending 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. Mr Healey said these were chosen because they supplement equipment used in Gaza for “offensive purposes”, while the “vast majority of other parts our country exports to Israel are either not related to the conflict or maybe used for Israel’s defence"". UK arms sales to Israel are small in comparison to other allies, contributing just 1% of the country’s defence imports. The UK exports arms to multiple countries including Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The US is by far the largest supplier of arms to Israel, accounting for 69% of its imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In a statement, Mr Zomlot said that the Palestinian Mission to the UK would ""continue working"" with the UK government towards a ""full arms embargo"". Amnesty International UK accused the government of ""gesture politics"", given less than 10% of arms export licences were suspended.  The charity's chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh, said the restrictions were ""too limited and riddled with loopholes"". “[The] decision means that while ministers apparently accept that Israel may be committing war crimes in Gaza, [the government] is nevertheless continuing to risk complicity in war crimes, apartheid - and possible genocide - by Israeli forces in Gaza,"" he said. The non-profit organisation has continuously called for a ceasefire and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. On social media, Mr Netanyahu said: ""With or without British arms, Israel will win this war and secure our common future. ""Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain’s misguided decision will only embolden Hamas."" Asked about comments made by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who accused the government of ""abandoning Israel"", Mr Healey insisted the UK would support Israel in defending itself if it came under direct attack. Criticism has also come from within the Labour Party. Former shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the timing was “unfortunate”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World Tonight programme on Monday, she said: “I suspect that what was wanted was once they got the legal advice, they wanted to come in and tell Parliament about it straight away, but I think that it was unfortunate given all the funerals."" Ms Thornberry also said she expected a “detailed summary"" of the legal advice the government had received over arms, amid questions over the continued supply of parts for F35 jets. Mr Healey said components for F35s were “deliberately” not included in the suspension as they are used by 20 countries and it would be  ""hard to distinguish"" which components would go into Israeli jets. Zarah Sultana, who is currently sitting as an independent MP after being suspended from the Labour Party, has called for an end to all arms sales to Israel.  Writing on X, formerly Twitter, the MP for Coventry South described the F35 jets as “the most lethal in the world”. Former national arms advisor Lord Peter Ricketts told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the government’s decision was ""long overdue"". Lord Ricketts told the BBC in April following an Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers that the UK should stop selling arms to Israel, claiming there was “abundant evidence” that obligations on civilian safety were not being fulfilled. In his latest interview with the BBC, he said: “There comes a point when the legal advice is so clear the government has an obligation to follow it."" The Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the move was ""welcome but inadequate"", and said it would continue to push for the government to ""apply the principles of international law"" to all export licenses.  Israel has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October during which about 1,200 were killed and 251 were taken hostage.  More than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cdd734dp7emo,"Fury, hope and changing gear with a sword - Ukraine's Paris preparations","After more than two years of war, Ukraine aim to continue punching above their weight and to extend their remarkable Paralympic record.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.690507,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Fury, hope and changing gear with a sword - Ukraine's Paris preparations âI was ready to die. The probability of dying was so high that you had to come to terms with it.â In 2022, Danylo Chufarovâs home city of Mariupol was under siege. For three weeks, as the shells rained down around him, he survived on little food, no electricity and rain water.  His home was destroyed, along with most of his possessions. He didnât train for six months. But, in 2023, he became a triple world champion - the best results of his long swimming career.  He was nominated for the prestigious Laureus Awards, posing for photos on the red carpet with tennis star Novak Djokovic and Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham.  Now the swimmer, who is visually impaired, is hoping to become a Paralympic champion. âWe can show we are ready to fight,â he smiles. âMy country shall fight on the battlefield - and we shall fight in sport. Thatâs our mission.â Chufarov poses with 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in April Ukraineâs Paralympic success is one of sportâs more startling anomalies.  As a general rule, the Paralympic medal table broadly mirrors that of the Olympics. At the last summer Paralympics in Tokyo, China, Great Britain, the USA, Russia (competing as the Russian Paralympic Committee) and the Netherlands were the best performing nations. A month before, they had all finished in the top seven in the Olympic medal table. But next on the Paralympic list was Ukraine.  They won 98 Paralympic medals in Tokyo, putting them sixth.  And yet at the Olympics just a few weeks earlier, they had finished 44th. This was far from a one-off. In fact, Ukraine can claim to be the most consistently successful Paralympic nation in the world. At the last 10 Paralympic Games â summer and winter â since 2004, Ukraine have finished in the top six in every single medal table.  No other country in the world has done that. They competed at the 2022 Winter Games despite their country being invaded just a few days earlier.  After a four-day journey to Beijing, images of their athletes chanting âpeace for Ukraineâ resonated around the world, external.  Somehow, they went on to finish second in the medal table, ahead of traditional winter sport powerhouses such as France, Canada and the United States. The 2022 Winter Paralympics began a little over a week after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the country's Paralympic Committee, was part of Ukraine's protests at the Games The challenges that Ukraineâs athletes have faced since 2022 are all too stark.  Chufarov says the effects of his experiences in Mariupol will never leave him. âI lost a few kilos but that doesnât reflect my mental state when I left the city. I believe that this trauma will stay with me forever,â he says. He now trains in a swimming pool near Dnipro. It is one of the few facilities near him that have not been destroyed or occupied by the Russian army. However, it is less than 100 miles from the front line.  âThere are air-raid alarms all the time,"" he says. ""We have to escape to the bomb shelters â and there are electricity shortages too. These are the conditions we have to train in.â Chufarov's flat in an apartment block in Mariupol was destroyed by Russian shelling The man behind Ukraineâs extraordinary success is the president of their Paralympic Committee, Valeriy Sushkevych.  He developed a programme called Invasport, which created specialist facilities for disability sport in every region of the country. However, that infrastructure, like much else in Ukraine, has been badly damaged. Sushkevych says 500 of Ukraine's disabled sports facilities have been destroyed. He describes preparations for the Paris Paralympics as âterribleâ, with athletes sleep-deprived from air-raid sirens sounding through the night. âThereâs physical danger from bombs and rockets every day â every hour sometimes,"" he says. âWhat kind of preparation can we talk about when people training outdoors see rockets flying â and know these rockets are flying to kill people and kill their relatives?â He says repeating Ukraineâs success in recent Games will be difficult.  âVictory often depends on the emotion of the athlete. Say, for example, an athlete about to start their competition finds out that 10 minutes earlier, there was an air attack in Ukraine near their family.  ""Our athletes will need to be strong like our soldiers.â A lot of athletes have been forced abroad, with all the inevitable personal stress and disruption to training, especially as their coaches often can't go with them. Twenty-year old swimmer Anna Hontar now lives in Finland after escaping from the occupied city of Kherson.  Trapped inside her house for a month, her father made her an improvised gym. âHe put rubber over some rails on the wall and I could imitate freestyle, butterfly and backstroke,"" she says.  ""It was too dangerous to go outside. There was fighting on the streets.â Hontar won 50m freestyle S6 bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics and has taken gold in the event at the two subsequent World Championships in Madeira and Manchester Arriving in Finland, her biggest shock was the quantity of snow â âIn Ukraine, we get just a little bit, but it was so highâ â but her swimming doesnât seem to have suffered. Like Chufarov, she also won gold at the World Championships in Manchester last year. Those championships didnât feature any Russian swimmers, who were banned from competing. At the Paralympics in Paris, thatâs set to change. The International Paralympic Committee say it is expecting 90 Russian athletes to compete as neutrals. At the Olympics earlier in the summer, only 15 Russian athletes took part. Competing against Russian rivals will not be easy.  âThey killed our children, people out on the streets and in the houses where they lived,"" says Hontar. âSwimming is not political â but maybe their parents, their uncles or their fathers have gone in to our country. It is so difficult.â I ask her whether this gives her an extra motivation to win at the Paralympics. âYesâ she replies instantly, her eyes suddenly flashing with determination. âI want to fight for Ukraine, for my family and for our Paralympic team. I want to fight.â Hontar has relocated to Finland from Kherson. The city was captured in the early days of the war as Russian forces swept west from occupied Crimea. It was liberated by Ukraine eight months later but is still under attack Other athletes have found their own ways to contribute to the war effort. Wheelchair fencer Andrii Demchuk crossed the border to Poland with his wife and two children after the invasion. After settling his family in Warsaw, he began helping other Ukrainian refugees. He ferried them from the border to the Polish capital, before returning with tents, sleeping bags and equipment for the Ukrainian army. He also delivered jeeps to the border â albeit in unconventional style. As a leg amputee, Demchuk normally drives an automatic. The jeeps were manual. âIt was a bit of a problem because I donât have a leg to push the clutch,â he says.  So â ingeniously - he used his fencing sword instead. âA broken rapier can push the clutch perfectly,â he explains, demonstrating his technique with an imaginary sword. âI delivered seven jeeps this way.â Together with two Polish fencing friends, Grzegorz Pluta and Stefan Makowski, he also began visiting local schools.  âWe realised we needed to bring Polish and Ukrainian children together,"" Demchuk says. ""The Ukrainian kids were traumatised â and there were some differences.â They visited around 40 schools â and talked to about 10,000 children.  âWe wanted to show the kids how sport can take your mind off your problems and that people who are disabled donât give up and can still break barriers.â At this point, Demchuk realised that if he didnât return to training, he wouldnât qualify for the Paralympics, so Pluta and Makowski invited him to train at their club in Warsaw. Most of Ukraine's Para-fencers are in similar circumstances, having had to leave their homeland. Demchuk trained one of his team-mates - Nadiia Doloh - after her coach was unable to follow her to Poland. Despite the disruption, Ukraineâs Para-fencing team finished top of the medal table at this yearâs European Championships. Demchuk gives an exhibition on Para-fencing at a school in Poland Demchuk has since returned to his home city of Lviv, where heâs taken on another role at the military hospital. He speaks to injured servicemen about adapting to life with a prosthetic. âI tell them that life goes on â and you donât need to be worried,"" he says.  ""Donât get depressed, donât take to alcohol or other substances - just be active from the start. I won them over because Iâm a sportsman and an amputee, so they trusted me.â And while his thoughts are now focused on Paris, theyâre also focused on his countrymen. After he won a gold medal at the Rio Paralympics in 2016, he dedicated his triumph to two friends who had been been killed during Russia's earlier incursions into the Donbas region. Demchuk says he has lost many more friends during the current conflict. Will he be thinking of them when he competes in Paris? âThe problem is, if I think about my friends â and about the war â I wonât win because of the emotionsâ¦. â he says, his voice briefly faltering.  âIn fencing, if you have this emotion, itâs not good. Youâll lose the fight before you even start.â But if you were to win a medal? He clasps his hands together, smiles and looks to the skies.  âI hope,â he says.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0532n9pdko,"Ukraine F-16 destroyed during Russian attack, BBC told",The incident happened just weeks after Kyiv took delivery of the supersonic aircraft.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.787015,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"One of the F-16 fighter jets sent from Nato allies to Ukraine has been destroyed, a Ukrainian military source has told the BBC. The aircraft went down amid a barrage of Russian missiles on Monday, killing pilot Oleksiy Mes, Ukraine's military said. It marks the first loss of its kind since the planes were delivered earlier this month. The cause of the crash was not a direct result of an enemy missile strike, the Ukrainian military claims. It said the pilot destroyed three cruise missiles and one drone in Russia's largest aerial attack to date. ""Oleksiy saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles,"" the Ukrainian Air Force wrote in a statement on social media. ""Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life."" The statement did not specify the type of plane involved, but a military source told the BBC the pilot was flying an F-16. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially confirmed on Tuesday the US-made F-16s were being deployed to shoot down Russian drones and missiles. This week, he asked allies to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to hit targets further into Russia. Dutch Chief of Defence Gen Onno Eichelsheim confirmed the Netherlands will provide Ukraine with 24 of the jets, in addition to more weapons.  There will be no restrictions on their usage apart from complying with humanitarian law, he told a conference in Washington on Wednesday - meaning Kyiv could launch deeper strikes into Russian territory.  Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023. Ukraine's F-16s work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground. They also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States. The  destruction of the aircraft is a blow to President Zelensky, who said he will deliver a ""victory plan"" to US President Joe Biden next month. He also revealed Ukraine had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile, but declined to share any more details. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93pw69x770o,Priti Patel defends record on rising immigration,Tory leadership candidate says as home secretary she made changes allowing ministers to control migration.,30 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.880367,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Conservative leadership candidate Dame Priti Patel has defended her record on immigration, which hit record levels during her time as home secretary.  Responding to questions following a speech in London, the MP for Witham said it was important to see the figures ""in context"" due to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Speaking to supporters she said she had made changes to the system allowing ministers to control migration.  Dame Priti was appointed home secretary by Boris Johnson in July 2019, launching a new points-based immigration system and signing the agreement with Rwanda to send some asylum seekers to the country. After a drop during the Covid pandemic, net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number of people leaving - then rose sharply during her time in the role, which she held until September 2022.  In 2022 net migration reached a record 745,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some Tories have pointed to the party's failure to reduce migration as a key reason for their historic defeat at this year's general election. Pressed over her record on migration, Dame Priti said: ""On my watch from 2019 onwards we delivered the structural reforms to the immigration and asylum system.  ""That was the introduction of a points-based immigration system which effectively means that the government of the day has the levers to control who comes into our country and who does not come into our country. And that includes numbers."" She added that it was ""too simple"" and ""lazy"" to speak about migration figures without ""context"".  ""Are we now saying that those NHS workers who came here during the pandemic and were not welcome and we should be sending them back?"" she said. ""Are we saying that we were insincere to the people that came from Hong Kong, the BNOs [British Nationals Overseas] and the Ukrainians when war in Europe took place? That is certainly not the Conservative Party that I represent."" Dame Priti also said that if she was prime minister, she would implement the Rwanda deportation scheme, which has been scrapped by the new Labour government.  She added: ""The sad thing is, we will never know now whether that Rwanda policy will work, because the government has just torn it up."" Dame Priti is one of six candidates for the Conservative leadership and faces competition from Tom Tugendhat, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, Mel Stride and Kemi Badenoch. They are currently aiming to secure the backing of fellow Tory MPs, who will whittle the field down to four candidates in a series of votes by the time of the party's annual conference at the end of September. The MPs will then narrow the field to a final two contenders, with party members choosing the winner, who will be announced on 2 November."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39kwmm3x94o,Will more stars boycott Dubai after rapper Macklemore?,"The United Arab Emirates is accused of having links to a paramilitary group, in Sudan, suspected of genocide.",2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:33.980143,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When fans saw rapper Macklemore had cancelled an upcoming gig, some of them assumed it was in solidarity with Gaza. But it wasn't. The gig was in Dubai and he had cancelled over the war in Sudan, which has already killed tens of thousands of people, left millions more hungry and triggered a humanitarian disaster. The glamorous Gulf city of Dubai is the biggest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - which has been widely accused of funding the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), one of the warring sides in Sudan. “The crisis in Sudan is catastrophic,” Macklemore said in an Instagram post on Monday. Some food security specialists estimate up to 2.5 million people could die of starvation and illness by October. “I have to ask myself what is my intention as an artist?” continued the rapper, who rose to fame with 2012 classic Thrift Shop. “If I take the money, while knowing it doesn't sit right with my spirit, how am I any different from the politicians I've been actively protesting against?” His moral stand has thrust the brutal conflict - which has garnered far less global attention than Ukraine or Gaza - into popular culture, and activists hope other artists will follow suit. “It was huge,” says an activist who has been campaigning for a ceasefire with the group London for Sudan. “In the comments there were a lot of people saying, ‘oh, my God, what's happening in Sudan?’ “I think it opened people's eyes.” The RSF is battling the Sudanese army for control of the country and has been accused of sexual violence, looting and ethnic cleansing in areas it controls. A Human Rights Watch report suggests the RSF may have committed genocide against non-Arabs in a city where 15,000 people are feared to have been killed, something the group denies. The RSF traces its roots to a militia, known as the Janjaweed, which were also accused of genocide 20 years ago in Sudan - an estimated 300,000 people died back then. Evidence tying the UAE to the RSF has been mounting. During the war it emerged that the RSF had used drones which a weapons expert from Amnesty International described as the “same drones” the UAE had supplied to its allies in other conflicts, including in Ethiopia and Yemen. Experts have also seen civilian aircraft allegedly transporting weapons from the UAE to the RSF, according to a UN report presented to the Security Council earlier this year. The allegation is that the UAE is trying to gain an economic foothold in the Red Sea and profit from Sudan’s resources. The RSF controls some of Sudan’s most lucrative gold mines, located in the Darfur region.  A Swiss aid organisation alleges the Emiratis are importing billions of dollars worth of the precious metal that are smuggled out of Africa, including Sudan. And before widespread fighting broke out in the country last year, the UAE signed a deal worth $6 billion to build and operate a port, airport and economic zone on the country’s Red Sea coast. The UAE government has described the allegations over its involvement in the Sudan conflict as ""baseless and unfounded"", and meant ""to divert attention from the ongoing fighting and humanitarian catastrophe"". ""UAE reiterates its call for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing conflict. The warring parties must stop fighting and work towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict through dialogue,"" it said in a statement to the UN. Macklemore said on Instagram that several groups had been reaching out to him over the Sudan crisis for months. A representative of Madaniya, an organisation for Sudanese people living in the UK, told BBC News: “A boycott by a major artist is obviously going to bring more attention to the Sudanese cause, which is great. “What would be a wonderful secondary consequence is if more people were to look into the UAE’s involvement in Sudan.” Over the next few weeks, Calvin Harris is due to give a performance in Dubai’s harbour and Sophie Ellis-Bextor has a date at the opera house. Neither replied to a request for comment. Prof Alex de Waal, an expert on Sudan based at Tufts University in Massachusetts, thinks a cultural and sporting boycott could be an effective way of targeting the regional powers accused of fuelling the war. He says the UAE and Saudi Arabia are competing for influence in Africa and are backing opposing sides in Sudan. The Saudi embassy in London has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Prof de Waal is convinced that the Arab rivals are so economically powerful that no-one is likely to sanction them - and says that any such measures would be difficult to implement. It wouldn’t be a priority for many Western countries, he adds, which are pre-occupied with the Israel-Gaza war and tensions with Iran. But he also suggests the UAE and Saudi Arabia care greatly about their reputation on the international stage. “Cultural figures and sports figures saying ‘we're not going there’ counts for much, much more than a threat of trade sanctions or financial penalties. “I think, interestingly, the [threat to them] of soft power is much stronger, and has much greater potential, than hard power.” Dr Crystal Murphy, a specialist on East African finance based at Chapman University in California, points towards protests against apartheid in South Africa which ultimately “rewrote political science and international relations”. She explains: “The boycotts came as a result of tons of public and celebrity [organising] and raising awareness of the issue, where enough people were pushing their governments. “So it can happen,” she adds. “What's the difference between Macklemore and the South Africa boycotts?” Campaigners are a long way from achieving boycotts of that scale, but are hopeful that momentum will gather after Macklemore’s move. The representative of Madaniya describes warring generals as trying to destroy the fabric of Sudanese society. But that doesn’t deter campaigners. “There’s always a hope for the Sudanese people,” the activist says. And already, some people appear to be following in Macklemore's footsteps. One commenter on his post said they'd been invited to speak at a convention in the UAE, but had now changed tack: “Your post encouraged me to research a bit more and I decided to decline the offer.” The Briefing Room dissects Sudan's ongoing war which has become one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86ld5z2ll7o,The school hostage massacre that exposed Putin's weakness,The roots of Putinism were already evident after the massacre of 334 people in a school in Russia in 2004.,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:34.077710,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The day Beslan began burying its dead, there were so many cars loaded with coffins that there was gridlock on the road to the cemetery. In the small Caucasus town, everyone had lost a relative or knew someone killed in the siege of School No. 1.  Launched by heavily armed militants, mainly from Chechnya, the terror attack lasted three days. Three hundred and thirty-four people died; 186 of them were children. It’s 20 years today since the siege ended suddenly in devastating explosions, but I can still hear the wailing of Beslan’s mothers; the grief that rolled over the town in waves. I can picture the white open coffin of 11-year-old Alina, laid out in her front yard with her dolls placed carefully beside her. And I will always remember Rima, who spent three days crammed into the stifling school gym with her grandchildren and hundreds of other hostages, bombs strung from the basketball hoops above them. Back then, she confessed that she was ashamed to have survived.  As she and her grandchildren ran for the exit, under fire, they had to climb over the dead body of a small boy. “God forgive us for that,” Rima begged, through streams of tears. In 2004, the suffering of Beslan was felt all over Russia and resonated all over the world. First and foremost, the tragedy was caused by the dozens of men and women who stormed the school, firing in the air and taking hundreds of petrified people hostage. They had rounded up mothers with babies and balloons, and little girls with big white bows in their hair. Whole families who had been celebrating the first day back to school. The militants stuffed the gym with explosives and began executing the male hostages. That summer, Vladimir Putin’s brutal war against separatists in Chechnya – launched four years earlier – had already burst beyond the borders of the southern Russian republic. The day before the Beslan siege, 10 people were killed when a Chechen woman blew herself up outside a Moscow metro station. Before that, suicide bombers blew two planes from the sky and there was a deadly attack on a music festival. But for two decades now there have been persistent, troubling questions about how Mr Putin and his officials handled the attack on Beslan in their determination not to ""give in"" to terrorists. Did they even try to negotiate?  Why claim the attackers made no political demands when they had called for Russian troops to pull out of Chechnya?  Could more children have been freed? Most critically, why did rescuers fire from tanks and use flamethrowers when there were still hundreds of hostages inside the school? To many, the siege of Beslan offered crucial early lessons in Putinism, including that he would spare nothing and no one to crush those who challenged him. It took 20 years for Mr Putin to visit the ruins of School No. 1. Even then, he didn’t join the anniversary events with the families. He only travelled there two weeks ago, alone. A few shattered walls of the school were left standing as a memorial, eventually encased in a gold-tinted shroud and hung with framed photographs of the dead.  There, in the middle of the gym where the hostages were held, Mr Putin placed flowers beneath a wooden cross. For most world leaders, it would be unfathomable not to have visited this spot before. It was Russia’s deadliest ever terror attack. But Mr Putin has always preferred to be filmed in a fighter jet or flanked by soldiers. The graves of children that he couldn’t save do nothing for his action man image. In fact, he had been to Beslan before, but barely noticed. Right after the siege collapsed, he flew in late at night to visit a hospital under cover of darkness. He told Beslan that all Russia was mourning with them but by sunrise he was gone. “He came far too late,” I remember hearing back then, from grieving families. “He should have stayed with us.”  But President Putin didn’t dare. Four years earlier, a previous encounter with grieving women had scarred and scared him. When the Kursk submarine sank in 2000 it took him five days to break off his holiday and by the time he met the relatives, they tore shreds off him. So Mr Putin began making the carefully-choreographed meeting a hallmark of his presidency. Only small, pre-vetted crowds. Everything under control. Last month in Beslan, just three mothers were brought to meet him. “It was an awful act of terror that took the lives of 334 people,” Mr Putin described their tragedy to them, for the sake of the state TV camera. ""Of that number, 136 were children."" The mothers are not in vision at that moment, but they surely winced at his mistake. Because 186 children were killed in Beslan.  It’s a number engrained on the brains of everyone in that town. It’s the one thing you don’t forget. But Mr Putin didn’t visit Beslan to empathise. The mothers in black were just a prop. He was using them to make a point.  Two decades ago, he reminded Russians, he had fought and won his war on terror. Now he was battling “neo-Nazis” and a hostile West in Ukraine, and he vowed he would win that war too. Distortion and lies were already in the 2004 Putin playbook. Then, officials grossly under reported the number of hostages in Beslan. I arrived in town on the first day of the siege and soon realised there were three times more hostages captive in that school than officials were admitting to.  Every local told us so. But state TV reporters, under instruction, continued to repeat the lie. People feared that troops were preparing to storm the school, so the authorities were playing down the potential casualty-count. I’ve often wondered what would happen to a government in a Western democracy after an attack that ended with many more hostages dead, than terrorists. I think it would struggle to survive the inevitable official inquiry, or the next election. Vladimir Putin didn’t have to worry about either. In 2017, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia had failed in its duty to protect the hostages and used ‘indiscriminate force’ as the siege collapsed. The case was brought by desperate, bereaved mothers, hunting for justice. But there was no new investigation in Russia itself. No senior officials held to account. When the 3 Beslan mothers complained to Putin about that in August, at their meeting, he professed surprise and promised to look into it. He’s had 20 years. He did address one thing, though, right after the siege. In 2004, Mr Putin announced he was cancelling direct elections for governors in Russia’s regions, claiming that would help improve security. There was no connection whatsoever to the Beslan attack. When parliament gathered to vote on the move, opposition politicians picketed the building warning of a creeping dictatorship. Two decades on, there is no more opposition.  State media has been fully tamed. Democracy has been crushed. The prime lesson Mr Putin took from the siege of Beslan was one about increasing control."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2edlw0y399o,Have budget worries constrained John Swinney's ambitions?,The first minister's first months in office are being dominated by severe financial pressures.,6 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.057786,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A row about kicking free school meals for primary school pupils into the long grass cannot be the maiden programme for government that John Swinney dreamed of setting out. In the few months since he achieved Scotland’s highest office, the first minister has presided over a damaging electoral reverse for the SNP and £500m of cuts to public services which overshadowed his legislative plans. Where does it leave Mr Swinney’s leadership, and what does it mean for the coming years at Holyrood? The programme John Swinney announced on Wednesday was all about the art of the possible, of keeping the government’s head above the water, of salvaging existing promises and programmes rather than proposing big new ones. In fairness, the first minister was clear from the outset about the constraints he faces. There's the politics; the SNP is a minority administration with precious little goodwill to trade on. The Greens are smarting after being kicked out of government and seeing some of their favourite policies shredded in the budget cuts. Labour scent blood and are more interested in ousting the SNP than helping them out.  And a new Tory leader is never going to do the deals that Annabelle Goldie did. Frankly it’s not even clear at this point how Mr Swinney will get a budget through parliament. He has done plenty of these negotiations in the past but he may need all of his experience just to persuade a handful of opposition members to abstain. Some at Holyrood are even whispering about the frankly dizzying prospect of a snap election. But really, the key constraint is financial. It would be easy to find political partners if their favoured projects could be funded. The immediate figures are stark. The public sector pay bill has gone up £800m this year alone. And pay is a recurring cost which knocks on into every subsequent year - future budgets only get harder. For context, Shona Robison could eliminate the Scottish Fire and Rescue service entirely, just trust people to put out their own fires, and it wouldn’t plug half of that £800m gap. It’s a symptom of the direction of travel of devolution ever since the SNP took office. The party has always been enamoured of a big state. Literally, when you consider we have a larger public service workforce; ministers have been proud to boast of having more teachers and doctors per head of population, and of paying - or “valuing” - them more. The same has been true in policy terms since Alex Salmond the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2007.  The big projects have almost always been about state intervention, from scrapping bridge tolls and prescription fees to free university tuition. Possibly the main legacy of Nicola Sturgeon’s time in office is Social Security Scotland, designed as a more generous welfare system, with widely lauded new benefits like the Scottish Child Payment. It is this “social contract” which ministers use to justify higher income tax rates; some Scots may pay more tax, but think of everything they get back in return. Many of these policies are good things, of course. They’re politically hard to argue against. There has been no debate about generous public pay settlements and no party has been bold enough to suggest reimposing tuition or prescription fees. But money is clearly running perilously tight and Ms Robison has warned that she can only do so much via the tax system as it stands. The outlay on social security is more than a billion pounds above the level of grant provided by Westminster, equivalent to services south of the border. By 2028-29 the gap is projected to hit £1.5bn. That’s roughly how much the government currently spends on the police service. Yes, nobody can deny that funding sections at Westminster have a huge impact, and Rachel Reeves has hardly been a ray of sunshine since she became chancellor. Further constraint seems to be on the cards and this Labour administration does not see to be gearing up for big state interventions which would funnel more money to the devolved administrations. That clearly has an impact, and it’s fair to also note the impact of external factors ranging from Brexit to Covid and the war in Ukraine. But Scottish government decisions have created a system which is moving inexorably in one direction, as the public finances have begun to drift in the other. A crunch has to come and we are only now on the precipice of it. That’s why there’s been so much talk about “difficult choices”. The turbulent times since Nicola Sturgeon left office have essentially been about picking out which past pledges will be delivered on. Humza Yousaf’s brief spell in charge was characterised by binning a series of more controversial policies, from highly protected marine areas to the defence of gender reform legislation. The Deposit Return Scheme was recycled, and the National Care Service has withered from a sweeping revamp to a central management board. Mr Swinney meanwhile has felt compelled to scrap universal winter fuel payments - mirroring a UK government move - and kick universal provision of free school meals to all primary six and seven pupils off into an unspecified future year. So what is left? In fairness, there are still some big reforms under way in Scotland. Changes to the justice system are working their way through parliament, which could range from scrapping the Not Proven verdict to holding rape trials without juries. That legislation could eat up some political capital in itself, with contention over the latter proposal in particular. Long-awaited education reforms are on the cusp of bearing fruit too, with the Scottish Qualifications Agency being replaced with a new body after a series of reviews. But among the 14 bills announced in Mr Swinney’s programme, there are none which look like a flagship. Indeed several are hangovers from Mr Yousaf - like the Misogyny Bill, which would create new criminal offences to protect women. Swinneyism, if there is such a thing, seems to be about tightening up existing systems rather than launching grand new ones. The former finance secretary knows how to work within a budget, and frankly all of it is taken up by delivering on the government’s past promises. So Mr Swinney’s bid to eradicate child poverty rests on making sure existing services join up and work efficiently together - like bringing together childcare, family support, and wider advice on careers and benefits into one cohesive safety net. It’s hard to see how this will spark a sudden turnaround, when £450m invested in the Scottish Child Payment has seen the poverty figures remain static at best. Perhaps the biggest way of changing that would be a broader upturn in economic fortunes. Hence the measures to boost growth, support businesses, attract investment and improve planning systems. The government also still hopes to enact public service reforms which would get the workforce back to pre-Covid levels. So there is plenty that can be done without passing fresh legislation, or enacting expensive new measures. It’s just that Mr Swinney would far rather have had the political and economic capital to have the option of doing so."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58mj7mzrdo,Russian woman's killer released for second time to fight in Ukraine,The 85-year-old grandmother's killer has been released only a week into his 22-year prison sentence.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.160904,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Russian murderer who was released from prison to fight in the war in Ukraine, only to then kill an elderly woman, has been released a second time to return to the front, according to relatives of the woman. “Grandma’s killer has escaped punishment for his crime – again – and has gone to fight in the war,” Anna Pekareva, the granddaughter of Yulia Byuskikh, told the BBC. In 2022, Ivan Rossomakhin was released from prison, where he was serving a 14-year prison sentence for murder, to join the Wagner mercenary group. He was later allowed to return home to the district of Vyatskiye Polyany in Russia’s Kirov Region. There, he attacked and killed 85-year-old Yulia in her own house. The killing was one of several committed by criminals who had been released from prisons all over Russia to join the Wagner group. In April this year, 29-year-old Rossomakhin was found guilty of Yulia’s rape and murder and sentenced to 22 years in a high-security prison, later increased to 23 years. The court noted that the killing ""involved extreme brutality"". But Anna says the prison governor has now notified the family that Rossomakhin was released on 19 August – just one week after the start of his sentence. “My first reaction was terror. I read the forensic reports and I know what this person did to my grandmother. It’s monstrous that he has been released again,” says Anna, adding: “The fact that this is happening in the 21st Century... there are no words that can describe what’s happening!” An official document seen by the BBC, signed by the prison governor, states that the inmate was released in connection with a specific Russian law that allows the military to recruit convicts to send to the frontline. It’s the second time the convicted murderer has been let out of jail in order to fight in Ukraine. Shortly after the start of the full-scale invasion, Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner mercenary group began recruiting convicts from prisons to fight in Ukraine. If inmates agreed to sign up, they would receive an official pardon from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Thousands of rapists, murderers and other criminals, including Ivan Rossomakhin, were released from incarceration and sent to the frontlines, where many were killed during brutal assaults on Ukrainian cities such as Bakhmut. After Prigozhin’s failed mutiny last year, when thousands of Wagner mercenaries marched on Moscow, enlisting inmates from prisons was taken over by the Russian military. The practice was formalised in an official federal law in March this year, and recruitment now appears to be intensifying. Under the law, convicted criminals who sign up to fight have their remaining sentences suspended for the duration of their military service. Some could even receive an official pardon if they win awards, for example for ""bravery"" on the battlefield. The Russian Embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment on the practice of releasing dangerous criminals to fight in Ukraine. Ukraine has also released some prisoners to fight at the front, though people convicted of murder or sexual offences are not eligible. Ukrainian Deputy Justice Minister Olena Vysotska told the AP news agency earlier this year that up to 3,000 prisoners have joined the military.  A grinding offensive by Russian forces in Ukraine’s Donbas region this year has depleted Moscow’s reserves. The UK Ministry of Defence has estimated that during two months of the operation, Russia lost as many as 70,000 men – that’s an average casualty rate of around 1,000 per day. Regular recruitment drives are being stepped up, too. In the last year, one-off payments for volunteering to fight have risen steeply. In some cases, men are offered as much as 1.5 million roubles (£12,360) to sign up. The Kremlin’s willingness to release highly dangerous criminals like Rossomakhin and send them to war indicates that the Russian military desperately needs more recruits. “It’s obvious there isn’t enough manpower,” Anna says.  “The authorities don’t give a damn about peaceful civilians if they allow people who have committed serious crimes to be exonerated and let out of prison. It tells us that no-one can feel safe in Russia.” Anna says Rossomakhin’s release means her family are now in extreme danger: “If he comes back he’ll try and take revenge on us – for our efforts to ensure he got a life sentence.

Even if he doesn’t return, how many more murderers and psychopaths are out there walking around?”"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14zyr11r08o,FM says Wales will not face Scotland-size cuts,"Wales will not face cuts as severe as Scotland during its next budget, Eluned Morgan says.",4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.342467,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Wales will not face cuts on the scale of Scotland where the SNP government is slashing £500m from its budget, the first minister has said. Eluned Morgan's ministers will present their spending plans for health, education and other public services later this year. She said the Welsh government had ""taken quite a lot of the pain already"" - it made £446m in savings in the last budget. Ms Morgan was appointed to replace Vaughan Gething after his resignation in the summer and is expected to announce her cabinet soon. She said that with one exception she had made ""no promises"" to her colleagues. On Monday Scotland's SNP finance secretary announced cuts worth up to £500m to balance the government's budget. She blamed public sector pay deals, ""prolonged"" Westminster austerity, inflation, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Academics warned before the general election of steep cuts to come for the Welsh government, estimating in June that the Labour UK government would need to provide another £683m to avoid cuts to non-protected areas of spending. In the last budget every Welsh government department except healthcare saw real terms cuts, with rural affairs the worst hit, with a total of £446m in savings. Ms Morgan, who was effectively appointed by Labour after no other candidate came forward for the job, said: ""Well, we've made some really difficult decisions in the past two budgets in Wales, so we think we've taken quite a lot of the pain already."" Asked if there could be a budget like Scotland's, she added: ""We're not expecting to see that kind of situation, because we've already made those hard choices."" Ms Morgan announced Mark Drakeford as interim health minister in August, but is yet to make a full cabinet reshuffle. She will have to decide whether to appoint the ex-first minister Vaughan Gething to the cabinet, as well as whether to give jobs to four former members of the government who resigned to trigger Mr Gething's resignation. Ms Morgan, who was taking part in a photo-opportunity with Education Secretary Lynne Neagle, was asked if the presence of Ms Neagle was a sign she would be staying on. ""I've made no promises to anyone"", she said, ""other than Huw Irranca-Davies, who is going to be the deputy first minister."" Ms Morgan and Ms Neagle were marking the completion of the roll out of free school meals for all primary school pupils - something which had been developed with Plaid Cymru while a co-operation deal was in force. The first minister defended the spending on free school meals amid the difficult financial situation. ""There was a stigma attached quite often to people applying for free school meals, and so we've got rid of that in primary schools,"" she said. Plaid Cymru criticised the first minister on Wednesday, accusing her government of a ""summer of inaction"" over the NHS problems like waiting times. Mabon ap Gwynfor, Plaid's health spokesman, said: ""The temporary appointment of Mark Drakeford could be seen as a decision that was made to appease the Labour benches following months of chaos and infighting."" Ms Morgan said: ""I made it absolutely clear that I was going to take the summer to listen, to get the priorities of the public, and that's what I've been doing. ""I can be absolutely clear that there will be some priorities set by the time we get back to the Senedd, when it starts properly in a couple of weeks time."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said: ""The first minister has clearly had her fingers in her ears during her so-called ‘listening tour’. ""Keir Starmer’s Labour has made the political decision to push pensioners into fuel poverty by cutting the Winter Fuel Payment, yet Baroness Morgan has failed to challenge this decision. ""Instead of prioritising the creation of more Senedd politicians, Baroness Morgan should be focussed on keeping Welsh pensioners warm this winter."" The Welsh government had warned in August that the cut to the universal nature of the winter fuel payment risked pushing some pensioners into fuel poverty."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd05pdmzgp5o,Scholz urges firewall against far right after election win,"The German Chancellor called the results of Sunday's state elections ""worrying"" and ""bitter"".",2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.420259,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has urged mainstream parties not to lend support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which won a big victory in the eastern state of Thuringia in Sunday's regional election. The result gives the far right its first win in a state parliament election since World War Two. The AfD also came a close second in Sunday's other big state election, in the more populous neighbouring state of Saxony. The AfD has been designated as right-wing extremist in both Thuringia and Saxony. Björn Höcke, the AfD leader in Thuringia, has previously been fined for using a Nazi slogan, although he denies knowingly doing so. On Monday, Mr Scholz urged other parties to block the AfD from governing by maintaining a so-called firewall against it. ""All democratic parties are now called upon to form stable governments without right-wing extremists,"" he said, calling the results ""bitter"" and ""worrying"". AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said that voters in Thuringia and Saxony had given her party a ""very clear mandate to govern"". She urged parties to ignore Mr Scholz's call to build government coalitions without the AfD, and said that doing so would ""undermine the democratic participation of large sections of the population"".  ""Firewalls are undemocratic,"" Ms Weidel added. Without the support of other parties, the AfD cannot govern in Thuringia. The second-largest party, the conservative CDU, has made clear it will not consider ruling with the far right.  Mathematically, then, the conservatives will need support from parties on the left to form a majority.  They have previously refused to work with the left-wing Die Linke, meaning they could have to look at the more radical left populist Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW to form a ruling coalition - an unpalatable option for many within the CDU. Mr Höcke, the AfD's top candidate in Thuringia has suggested there were plenty of CDU voters who would be happy if they worked together instead. In any case, with over 30% of the vote the AfD has a so-called ""blocking minority"" - meaning it will be able to stop the appointment of new judges or any constitutional change. Any coalition that emerges is likely to be highly unstable. In Saxony, the conservatives won 42 seats, just ahead of the AfD with 41, while Sahra Wagenknecht's party is in third with 15 seats.  In Thuringia, Mr Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) won just six seats, with none for his coalition partners the Greens and the liberal FDP. The SPD also fared badly in Saxony, where it came fifth. The elections underlined the unpopularity of Germany's ruling ""traffic-light"" coalition, so named because of the red, yellow and green of the party colours. Each of the three governing parties did badly, meaning they will fight their corner in the national coalition even more assertively.  Already leading figures within each party are saying they need to stand up for their own values. This will likely lead to more rifts within the national government. Ministers are saying they won’t break up the coalition, and bring down the government - but the fact they are saying this at all is a sign of how difficult things are within the coalition. Ms Weidel said people ""voted out"" the coalition and called on Mr Scholz and his partners to ""pack their bags and vacate their chairs, because the voters want a different government, they want a different politics"". The biggest issue for AfD voters on Sunday was immigration, and in particular the issue of refugees and asylum. Even though the AfD is still blocked out of governmental power both in the regions and nationally, the party does have an impact on mainstream politics.  When the AfD entered the Bundestag in Berlin in 2017 critics say their fierce anti-migrant rhetoric coarsened the debate.  Some believe the discourse in politics and the media has become more aggressive, and CDU leader Friedrich Merz is accused of aping AfD rhetoric.  Either way, to win back AfD voters mainstream parties are talking tougher on issues like migration and pushing through measures to make it easier to deport asylum seekers whose application has been rejected. The federal chairwoman of the umbrella organization of Turkish communities in Berlin, Aslihan Yesilkaya-Yurtbay, said that the results of the elections were ""shocking and frightening"". She added that many younger people of her generation are already planning to leave Germany. ""The future in this country for citizens with a migration background is being called into question,"" she said. The AfD also wants to stop weapons supplies to Ukraine, as does Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW. Some five million Germans in the east were eligible to vote on Sunday.  A third eastern state, Brandenburg, is due to vote in three weeks' time and although the AfD is ahead in the opinion polls, the Social Democrats and conservatives are only a few points behind."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1lpe26ylo,Massive Russian strikes hit Ukraine for second day,Local officials say at least three people have been killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine overnight.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.508007,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia has targeted Ukraine with another wave of deadly strikes, a day after one of its biggest air attacks of the war. At least two people were killed in an attack on a hotel in the central city of Kryvyi Rih and two more died in a wave of drone strikes on the Zaporizhzhia region in the south east, officials said. Ukrainian monitors had earlier detected Russian aircraft launching hypersonic missiles and the air force said it had shot down five missiles and 60 drones. At least six people died overnight Sunday to Monday and dozens were wounded as more than half of Ukraine's regions were attacked by drones and missiles. Power infrastructure was hit causing blackouts in many cities, with water supplies also affected. A statement from the Russian defence ministry said long-range air and sea-based precision weaponry had been used to strike power stations and related infrastructure across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, Lviv and the Kharkiv and Odesa regions. US President Joe Biden called the attacks ""outrageous"", saying Washington would continue to support Ukraine's energy grid. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned ""Russia's cowardly missile and drone attacks on civilian infrastructure"". In the latest attacks overnight into Tuesday, Russia said it had launched 10 missiles and 81 drones. A hotel was struck by a ballistic missile in Kryvyi Rih late on Monday, killing a man and a woman and leaving several others wounded. Two people were reported missing. Kryvyi Rih is the home city of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Meanwhile, Zaporizhzhia regional administration head Ivan Fedorov said two people had been killed and four more wounded by drone strikes. Explosions have also been reported in Kyiv, Sumy, Khmelnytsky and Mykolayiv regions. Launches of several hypersonic Kinzhal (dagger) ballistic missiles, which are hard for air defences to intercept, have been detected.  The latest attacks are being seen as an attempt by Moscow to reassert its control over the conflict after Ukraine's recent gains of territory in Russia's Kursk region. Russia has been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure since early on in its full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022. In recent months it has renewed its campaign of attacks on the power grid, causing frequent blackouts across the country. On Monday, Mr Zelensky called on Western allies including the UK, the US and France to change their rules and let Ukraine use their weapons to strike deeper inside Russia. Ukraine is allowed to use some Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia - but not long-range weapons. Mr Zelensky said ""we could do much more to protect lives"" if European air forces worked with Ukraine's air defence."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlnl2vqe2o,Ukraine to present 'victory plan' to US - Zelensky,"US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump would also be shown the plan, President Zelensky says.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.588336,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his troops' incursion into Russia's Kursk region is part of a ""victory plan"" that he will present to US President Joe Biden next month. Speaking at a forum on Tuesday, President Zelensky said the success of the plan would depend on President Biden and on whether the US would give Ukraine ""what is in this plan or not, [and] whether we will be free to use this plan, or not"". ""It may sound too ambitious for some, but it is an important plan for us,"" he added, saying that he would also show the plan to both US presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. A number of Ukrainian troops made an incursion into Russia's Kursk region in early August, and Russia has so far seemingly been unable to repel them.  Speaking at the same forum, Ukraine's Kyiv's top military commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Ukraine now controls 1,294 sq km (500 sq miles) of Russian territory and 100 settlements - although these figures have not been verified by the BBC.  Gen Syrskyi said Ukraine had no intention of holding on to the territory and that one motivation for the incursion was to distract Russia's forces away from their own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia is seeking to capture the town of Pokrovsk, which is an important hub and home to a key railway station. President Zelensky also revealed that Ukraine had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically-produced ballistic missile. He congratulated his country's defence industry, but declined to share any more details of the missile.  Although Ukraine has already used some ballistic missiles against Russia that were provided by the US, it has been working to develop the domestic production of military hardware to diminish its dependency on Western aid.  However, for now, Ukraine mostly relies on military supplies from abroad to fight Russia and repel its attacks. At the forum, President Zelensky said that Ukraine had used some newly arrived F-16 fighter jets sent by Western countries in order to intercept some of the missiles fired by Russia in recent days - but that the country would need more jets.  For the past two nights, Russia has pummelled Ukraine with a barrage of drone and missile attacks which have left several people dead and caused blackouts in various areas of the country.  Such attacks show that Moscow has no intention to stop the war, President Zelensky said: ""When they want [peace talks], they don’t launch 230 air strikes."" Since the Kursk incursion, however, Russia has signalled it will not engage in any peace talks with Ukraine. ""The topic of negotiations at the moment has pretty much lost its relevance,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9dyn3vg4do,Heritage under attack: Ukrainians revive interest in culture,Hundreds of cultural sites have been targeted in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:40.787168,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"It was late at night on 7 May 2022 when a Russian missile hit a museum that was once home to Ukraine’s 18th-Century poet and philosopher Hryhory Skovoroda. ""The roof was completely blown off, the walls are burnt and only Skovoroda's statue survived. It's a miracle that it did,"" says Nastya Ishchenko, deputy director of the museum in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine. It is one of 432 cultural sites damaged in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022, according to the UN’s cultural organisation Unesco. The destruction of so much of their culture has not just pushed Ukrainians farther away from the Russian-dominated cultural space they shared for decades under Soviet rule. It has also awakened a hunger for their own culture, described by one daily newspaper as a “Ukrainian cultural boom”. In total, 139 religious sites have been hit, 214 buildings of historical or artistic interest, 31 museums, 32 monuments, 15 libraries and one archive. The management at the Hryhoriy Skovoroda Museum knew it might come under attack and most of its valuable artefacts had been evacuated to a safer location. There was nothing military about the museum or its surroundings.  Ukraine’s museums in areas occupied by Russia have faced a very different problem. The full extent of plunder by Russian troops came to light in the final days of the occupation of the southern city of Kherson. Entire truckloads of artworks and historical artefacts were removed by Russians - ostensibly, for ""safekeeping"". The Kherson Art Museum says it has identified 120 artworks taken to Crimea - another occupied area of Ukraine. But the total number of artefacts the museum has lost is more than 10,000. In some museums in occupied parts of Ukraine, Russians removed exhibits for propaganda purposes. For example, an exhibition on Ukraine's modern history in Berdyansk has been replaced with one glorifying the ""special military operation"" - the Kremlin's official name for the war against Ukraine. Last May, another aspect of modern Ukrainian culture came under attack with the destruction of the Faktor Druk printing house in Kharkiv, used by almost all Ukrainian book publishers. Not every cultural building has been hit on purpose, although the attack on Faktor Druk, which killed seven people and destroyed 50,000 books, was widely seen as a targeted strike.  Other buildings have been hit because of their proximity to other buildings or to make them unusable for Ukrainian officials or troops. One publisher described the destruction of books at Faktor Druk as leading to a decline in morale in society. And the disappearance of numerous cultural sites in Ukraine has placed its very social fabric under strain. They are vital for the cohesion and resilience of communities at a time of war, says the head of Unesco's desk in Ukraine, Chiara Dezzi Bardeschi. ""What I've seen is communities really asking for culture and their cultural centres. They recognise its importance for the community and they need it for their resilience. Culture is very important for healing trauma,"" she tells the BBC. Ukraine's acting culture minister, Rostyslav Karandeyev, believes that Russia is deliberately targeting the country’s spiritual and historical symbols: “Not just military targets and critical infrastructure, but also anything that allows Ukrainians to speak of their own identity and statehood.” As part of this policy, Russian forces have been removing and destroying Ukrainian books from schools and libraries in occupied areas, he told the BBC. But amid all the gloom, Nastya Ishchenko from the Skovoroda museum believes Ukrainians have also started to value more what is under threat from the Russian invasion. ""It's like in a relationship: to understand what you've lost, it has to be taken away,"" she says. ""We're uniting not around aggression or anger, but around cultural values which each of us will hand down to future generations. It gives us a ray of light."" Den newspaper describes how bands, performers and writes are appearing, with new plays premiered and theatres full. Ukraine’s numerous volunteers have not just provided vital provisions and supplies of clothing and medicines, but musical instruments too. ""Children said that music helped them emotionally, it took them to a place where they don't hear bombs or sirens. It helps them enormously,"" UK-based musician Irina Gould told the BBC's podcast Ukrainecast. ""For them it's the best medicine, just to get away from reality and live in a world of beauty and happiness."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8lzyjprymo,Ukraine hopes its incursion into Russia changes outcome of war,Ukrainians say the foray into Kursk brings tactical advantages - and opens the door to ending the war.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.464040,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“All wars end with negotiations. It’s not the soldiers in the trenches who decide when.” Arni joined the Ukrainian army in 2022 to fight for his country’s survival. When we bump into him 30 months later, he describes a new motivation. “Peace.” “No-one likes war, we want to finish it,” he says while leaning against his camouflaged pick-up truck. For the troops we encounter close to Russia’s border, there’s a desire to end Russia’s invasion on acceptable terms. That is not to say survival isn’t a core driver - it is - but they seem to be striving for a finish line. “For Ukraine, our people, we’ll stand until the end,” adds Arni. Until 6 August, Ukraine’s sole objective was one of liberation. The complete repelling of Russian forces to its borders from before Russia first invaded in 2014. Albeit at a grinding pace, the reverse has been happening for the past year-and-a-half with Moscow eroding Ukrainian territory. Then came the “all in” poker play which surprised everyone apart from the battle-hardened Ukrainian soldiers who carried it out: a counter-offensive into Russia’s Kursk region. “It was undeniably successful and daring,” observes Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre, a think tank. Now, Kyiv can’t reference its offensive often enough, with countless pictures of troops giving out aid as they tear down Russian flags. “It also changes the narrative,” says Alina Frolova, security expert and former deputy defence minister of Ukraine. “A situation where we’re losing territory step by step is not a good one. “Ukraine’s strategic position has changed.” Despite parallels with Russia’s initial invasion, Kyiv claims its goal is not to occupy. So what is the aim? Well, there’s more than one. “This attack was partly carried out so the city of Sumy was better protected,” explains Serhii Kuzan, who thinks it is often forgotten that the border is still a front line. Since the start of this summer, President Volodymyr Zelensky says there were more than 2,000 strikes on the Sumy region from the Kursk region alone, including 250 glide bombs. For months it was feared Russian troops were preparing for a cross-border attack of their own, and by pushing them back, Serhii believes defending Ukraine in general will be easier. “The [now captured] Russian city of Sudzha is on a commanding height. The Russians are already in a less advantageous position because we control the approach routes.” While Russia has had to react to Ukraine on the battlefield, it has also had its supply lines targeted. Key roads have been seized and a strategically important bridge destroyed. Which leads us to: “The main purpose of this offensive into Kursk is to divert Russia’s attention from its occupied territories in Ukraine,” says Ivan Stupak, who worked for Ukraine’s security service (SBU) between 2004-2015. The good news for Ukraine is that is what appears to be happening. The bad news is that Russian advances, notably towards the town of Pokrovsk, are not slowing. “The Russian army has been redeploying some troops from different directions - the Kherson, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, for example,” Ivan says. He believes around 10,000 personnel are being diverted, mostly from other parts of Russia. It is how President Zelensky describes Ukraine’s collection of captured Russian soldiers. Historically, when Ukraine has momentum, it captures more and consequentially negotiates the release of their own more easily. The Kursk offensive has been no exception. Kyiv says hundreds of Russian troops were taken prisoner. Several could be seen surrendering in drone footage and being taken back to Ukraine with tape blindfolds. “Moscow is actually offering to start negotiations to exchange prisoners of war,” says Serhii Kuzan. “It is no longer us, enlisting the support of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to ask Russia to hand over our prisoners of war.” This is a huge part of it for Kyiv. On a civilian level, you had the horror and anger felt in the Kursk region in response to the blistering Ukrainian assault on their homes. There were mass evacuations, pleas for help and criticisms of some authorities for not preventing the attack. On a political level, you had Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly processing events in Moscow while being briefed by his security chiefs. And of course there is the military level. “The influence of this Ukrainian incursion could be quite substantial,” concludes Alina Frolova. “That’s why using highly professional troops was specifically the right decision.” If Ukraine does not plan to keep hold of its captured Russian territory in the long term, but can hang on long enough, it hopes to leverage it for the release of its own land. But it’s a big “if”. When fighting slows, that has always suited Russia with its superior size. Misdirection and surprise has often worked for Ukraine. “In a symmetric war, we have no chances with Russia,” points out Alina Frovola. “We need to make asymmetrical actions”. Slowing advances in the Kursk region may leave Kyiv with difficult decisions. But there are benefits for as long as  there is movement, Serhii Kuzan argues. “An advance rate of 1-3km a day is normal for swapping forward units with reserves,” he says. “In Ukraine’s Donbas region, the average advance rate for the Russians is 400m. “Our pace in the Kursk region is five times faster than a 100,000-strong army!” But the problem for Kyiv, is that Russians are still going forward in Ukraine. However, don’t expect Ukraine to withdraw from its Russian attack anytime soon. It is committed now. Russia’s president initially labelled the offensive as a “terrorist attack” and “provocation”, but in the days since he has barely referenced it publicly. That’s despite it fitting into his narrative that Russia’s invasion is a defensive war to protect his people. Perhaps he doesn’t want the alarm felt by many in the Kursk region to spread, or for it to appear like his military doesn’t have control of the situation. Also, as with the Kursk submarine disaster and failed coup of last year, Vladimir Putin doesn’t always act quickly to regain the initiative. Ukraine will be hoping he’s not this time because he can’t. Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous, Sophie Williams and Hanna Tsyba"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d90ke0ello,"Seven killed in 'most massive' Russian air attack, Ukraine says",Russia launched missiles and drones into more than half of Ukraine's regions on Monday.,27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.569431,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia has launched one of its biggest air attacks on Ukraine of the war so far, the head of the Ukrainian air force has said. At least seven people were killed and dozens wounded as missiles and drones were fired into more than half of Ukraine's regions on Monday. Power infrastructure was hit, causing widespread blackouts, as the entire country was put under air raid alert and told to take shelter. Russia confirmed it had launched attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - one of its long-term tactics - and said all its targets were hit. The barrage of missile and drone attacks began across the country overnight on Monday and continued into the morning. And much later in the day a civilian infrastructure building was struck by a Russian missile in the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, leaving one woman dead and another five presumed missing, local military administration head Oleksandr Vilkul said on Telegram. According to Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of Ukraine's air force, Russia launched 127 missiles and 109 attack drones overnight and into Monday morning. Out of them, Ukraine shot down 102 missiles and 99 drones, he said on Telegram. Mr Oleshchuk called the combined strike ""the most massive aerial attack”. Nato member Poland said an ""object"" entered its territory during the attack. ""Most likely it was a drone and we assume so, because the trajectory of the flight and the speed indicate that it was definitely not a missile,"" said army spokesman Jacek Goryszewski, quoted by Reuters. Nato spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah condemned the attacks on Ukraine and said that breaches of Nato airspace by Russia were ""irresponsible and potentially dangerous"", the agency said. Previously, an attack last December when 158 missiles and drones were fired at Ukraine, had been considered the largest attack so far. While the main target of this attack was energy infrastructure, it was also an attempt by Moscow to strike at Ukraine's reserves of another key resource: morale. Ukrainians have been electrified by the recent successful incursion of their troops deep into Russian territory in the Kursk region.  With Monday's strikes, Russia was intending to bring ordinary people in Ukraine back down to earth with a bump - reminding them, and politicians in Western capitals, that the Kremlin still has the upper hand in this war. The message from Moscow was make no mistake, Russia can still inflict misery on the Ukrainian population whenever it chooses. Some 15 regions of Ukraine were targeted by Russia in the strikes, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said earlier - using weapons including drones, cruise missiles and supersonic missiles. ""There are wounded and dead,"" Mr Shmyhal said on the Telegram social media app. Dozens of people were injured, and those who died included:  The attacks caused serious damage to infrastructure, with power outages reported in many cities - including Kyiv - and water supplies disrupted. One of the remaining power stations – a hydroelectric plant north of Kyiv – was one of the latest targets. The damage is still being assessed. Russia has been targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure since early on in its full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022. In recent months it has renewed its campaign of attacks on the power grid, causing frequent blackouts across the country. In June, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had destroyed half of his country’s electricity-generating capacity since it began pummelling its energy facilities in late March. Ukraine is buying energy from the European Union. However, this is not enough and so most days, the country has a planned nationwide blackout to protect critical needs such as hospitals and military sites. Russia's defence ministry said it attacked electricity and gas facilities, as well as sites storing Western weapons. ""All designated targets were hit, resulting in power outages and disrupted rail transport of weapons and ammunition to the front line,"" it said. It has been a year of bad news on the battlefield for Kyiv, with Russia gaining ground steadily in the eastern Donbas region.  There have been problems with mobilisation and reports that Ukraine is running out of men.  But following Ukraine's surprise incursion into Kursk, the videos of soldiers hoisting the Ukrainian flag over Russian villages they had seized gave a badly-needed boost to Ukrainian morale.  And it showed the West that Kyiv is still capable of carrying out complex, daring and - most importantly - successful offensives. On Monday, Mr Zelensky called on Western allies including Britain, America and France to change their rules and let Ukraine use their weapons to strike deeper inside Russia.  Ukraine is allowed to use some Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia - but not long-range weapons. And he said ""we could do much more to protect lives"" if European air forces worked with Ukraine's air defence. Also on Monday, Ukraine tried to attack an oil refinery in Yaroslavl, a city north-east of Moscow, according to the regional governor. No casualties or damage have been reported. And Russia's defence ministry said it had destroyed nine drones over its Saratov region, which is 560 miles (900km) from the Ukrainian border."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyj0810304o,Swinney to make eradicating child poverty greatest priority,Scotland's first minister will put fighting child poverty at the centre of his Programme for Government.,4 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.672775,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"John Swinney believes the Scottish government can still “enhance the lives of children and their families” as he prepares to set out its spending plans for the next 12 months. The first minister’s inaugural Programme for Government will make eradicating child poverty its “single greatest priority”. The latest figures show that 26% of children are living in relative poverty in Scotland, despite targets to reduce that number below 18% by the end of the current financial year. It comes after Mr Swinney’s finance secretary, Shona Robison, announced a £500m package of cuts in order to balance the government’s books. The spending blueprint will be the first put forward by Mr Swinney since he took over as first minster from Humza Yousaf in May. Reducing the number of children living in poverty was one of his key pledges when he became leader of the SNP. He pointed to the introduction of the Scottish Child Payment in 2021 – which is payable to the families of each child under 16 living in a low-income household – as an example of the government’s efforts to combat the issue. Campaigners said the “scale and pace” of the action on lifting young people out of poverty has “not been nearly enough”. The Scottish government’s own legal targets aim to reduce the numbers to 10% in the 2030-31 financial year. But Mr Swinney said he would double down on prioritising measures to meet those goals. “Even as we face unprecedented budgetary constraints, I am optimistic that we can still greatly enhance the lives of children and their families,” he said. “No one's opportunities should be determined by the circumstances they are born into, which is why this year's Programme for Government will prioritise measures focused on our single greatest priority of eradicating child poverty. ""We already have a strong track record of improving the lives of children across Scotland, including through our game-changing Scottish Child Payment and expansion of early learning and childcare. This government's policies are estimated to keep 100,000 children out of relative poverty this year."" Mr Swinney also highlighted figures from the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), which say low income families in Scotland will be £28,000 better off by the time their child turns 18, compared to others across the UK. CPAG’s Scottish director, John Dickie, said progress had been made on tackling child poverty, but that greater investment in public services was needed to hit the statutory targets. He said: “The tough reality facing government and opposition alike is that there is no credible route to eradicating child poverty that doesn’t involve further serious investment in social security, childcare, affordable family housing and action to support parents access decent jobs. “More can and must be done to reform public services so that hard up families can access them, but those services need to be available and adequately funded in the first place.” Ms Robison told the Scottish Parliament the country was facing ""enormous and growing"" financial pressure during her statement on Tuesday. She cited public sector pay deals, ""prolonged"" Westminster austerity, inflation, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine before announcing plans to cut £188m across government departments. A further £65m is to be saved from the reintroduction of peak rail fares, axing concessionary travel for asylum seekers and granting local authorities power to finance pay deals by drawing on funds from existing programmes. Up to £60m will be saved through emergency spending controls imposed on government departments relating to recruitment, overtime, travel and marketing. And £460m will be drawn down from the ScotWind leasing auction of seabed plots for offshore wind projects. Despite those cuts, Mr Swinney said his spending outline would include ""investment in public services, growing the economy and tackling climate change.” But Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the SNP had “ripped up its flagship pledges” and called for an end to “17 years of broken promises”. “NHS waiting lists are at a record high, the attainment gap is widening in our schools, our justice system is at breaking point and SNP financial chaos means more cuts are looming,"" he said. Scottish Conservative Liz Smith said the independent Scottish Fiscal Commission had made ""abundantly clear"" that much of the financial pressure came from the Scottish government's own decisions. She said Scotland was losing out on £624m in revenue because its economy is growing at a slower rate than the UK as whole. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said Mr Swinney’s party had “repeatedly” taken Scotland for granted. Meanwhile, Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, said it was Mr Swinney's ""last chance"" to save his government's climate credentials. “We need to see a clear commitment to our environment,"" she said. John Swinney would dearly love to make a big splash with his first Programme for Government as first minister, to reset the record after a damaging election result in June. But he has precious little cash on hand to do it, underlined by his finance secretary announcing half a billion pounds worth of cuts yesterday. Mr Swinney will focus on what has been his top priority since he became first minister – eradicating child poverty. A lot of money has already been committed to measures like the Scottish Child Payment, but the SNP leader says he is optimistic that more can still be done. That is backed up by the data when you consider that overall levels of child poverty in Scotland have not fallen. Ministers often repeat that 100,000 children have been kept above the breadline by their policies, and the child payment is frequently lauded by charities. But with the total figure remaining stubbornly static, there may need to be further investment in similarly striking policies if Mr Swinney’s goal is to be achieved."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y832nyl2po,Defence firms 'need reassuring' that big orders will be long-term,"Western military production has ramped up due to Ukraine, but will it continue after the war ends?",26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.748977,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"After years of declining defence spending in many Western countries, the war in Ukraine since 2022 has led to a huge increase. While Nato member states are not directly involved in the conflict, support for Kyiv has ramped up production of weapons and other military equipment. And longer-term concerns about Russia has meant that Nato countries are continuing to increase their own armament stockpiles. For defence firms like the UK’s BAE Systems, it has meant a surge in sales over the past three years. This month the company announced that its latest half-year revenues were up to £13.4bn, 13% higher than the same period in 2023. Meanwhile, its order backlog now stands at £74.1bn, its highest ever. “We will keep investing in new technologies, facilities and our people, so that we can deliver on our record order backlog, and help our government customers stay ahead in an uncertain world,” said BAE’s chief executive Charles Woodburn. But how easy or otherwise has it been for Western defence firms to increase production? And how long will the demand boom last? To boost armament production since 2022 it has mainly been a matter of increasing output at existing factories. But this is not quite as easy as it sounds. Many sites had only really been ticking over, if that, for years. This made expanding production not something that could be done quickly or easily. Andrew Kinniburgh, director general of Make UK Defence, one of the industry’s trade bodies gives me an example. “If you look at the Nlaw [a shoulder-fired anti-tank missile system] designed by [Swedish firm] Saab, and built by Thales in Belfast, they hadn’t had any new orders for many years, and the production line was basically mothballed.” Then in 2022, Saab got a £229m contract from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) for thousands more Nlaws, with many of these to be assembled in Belfast by Thales over the next four years. Going from “mothballed” to fulfilling an order of that size is quite the challenge for any factory. The facility has more recently won a £176m order from the MoD for a separate weapon, Thales' lightweight multi-role missiles. “I’m incredibly proud of our Belfast workforce, who have massively stepped up to the challenge,"" says Alex Cresswell, chief executive of Thales in the UK. ""This has included new shift patterns, and processes being implemented to maximise working time. “Since just before the invasion of Ukraine up to this year, just a little over two years, factory outputs have doubled. It’s doubled to the most this factory has produced in living memory. And then in the next couple of years it will double again.” Much of the West’s armed forces have not been prepared for the possibility of fighting a major conflict since the end of the Cold War. The only ammunition they really use is during training, and stockpiles of weapons are very low. A sizeable chunk of what they did have in storage has been given to Ukraine, and now needs replacing. And future stockpiles need to be much larger. Mr Kinniburg says that Western governments are going to have to help defence firms significantly invest in both new production facilities and storage space for armaments. Building more weapons and increasing ammunition supplies is very expensive, but Nato nations are finding the money. As the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported recently: “Overall, total Nato spending increased by 11% in 2024, compared to 3% in 2023. Growth was even stronger among Nato’s European members, “who increased their combined military spending by 19% in real terms in 2024”, said the study. In the UK, Kier Starmer, the new Labour Prime Minister, has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, up from 2%. It comes as Russia has significantly ramped up its arms production, and increased imports from North Korea and Iran. Meanwhile, although China denies sending Russia weapons, it does supply Moscow with ""dual-use items"" - those with both commercial and military applications. Stuart Dee, research leader in defence and security at the Rand Europe think tank, says that increased military spending across Nato members is unlikely to be a temporary phenomenon. “More than two years in, the conflict in Ukraine is increasingly unlikely to be a short. “Moreover, the security situation that emerges after the Ukraine conflict, whenever that is, is increasingly unclear, with potential security challenges across the globe. We are likely to see a sustainment of the increased defence spending across the board, as states around the globe adjust away from what has been a relatively benign period.” But defence manufacturers do not seem convinced yet, they have spent decades being rather unloved. Mr Dee says that means Western governments are trying to persuade them they are now back in favour and will stay in favour. “Governments are attempting to give surety, that this is a long-term supply deal,” he says. “That this is not just a two-second thing, and then you will be back to another 30 years of decline.” Governments are trying to press home that message. Dr Cynthia Cook is a senior fellow at the International Security programme, and the head of the defence industry initiatives group at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. She says one way for governments to do this is by placing long-term orders now. “The challenge for defence firms is not really solely how long the war in Ukraine is going to last, and whether it is worthwhile investing, but who is going to pay? “One of the signals that governments can send is to have long-term, multi-year contracts that tells industry they are going to get the money back from these investments.” But that is not defence firms’ only problem. New investments and capacities push up costs, and the next time the government is tendering for supplies of ammunition, the company that didn’t invest to increase production, might well be able to undercut the company that did. Knowing which way to jump is difficult. Then there is the problem of recruitment, people are wary of joining an industry that was ignored and run down until the war in Ukraine broke out. People are not exactly queuing to join an industry and devote their lives to it, when it has been in the doldrums for so long. Even so, defence manufacturers from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics in the US, German’s Rheinmetall, Sweden’s Saab, and the UK’s BAE Systems, are continuing to see a boom in orders. This is reflected in their soaring share prices. Meanwhile, the FTSE All-Share Defence and Aerospace index has risen by more than half over the past year.  Then, of course, there are the lessons to be learnt from the war in Ukraine. Experts from the world’s armed forces and their suppliers are poring over the data from the battlefield. Makers of military drones, seem to be the first major gainers from this analysis, it is a new technology which is cheap, easy to use and is having a decisive effect on the future of warfare. It is a sector where small and medium-sized companies are making a name for themselves. That in turns means there will be more spending on anti-drone capability. No country can afford to shoot down £500 drones with missiles that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and take months to replace for very long. War is good for business, but it has also usually been good too for developing new technologies and weapons, and then developing the response to those new weapons. Ukraine is just accelerating that process, if at a huge cost in human lives and misery."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02w01xr2jo,German far right hails 'historic' election victory in east,Germany's anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany is on course for victory in Thuringia.,2 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.836817,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Germany's anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) is celebrating a ""historic success"", with a big victory for the far-right party in the eastern state of Thuringia. The AfD won almost a third of the vote, nine points ahead of the conservative CDU, and far in front of Germany's three governing parties. The result gives the far right its first win in a state parliament election since World War Two, although it has little hope of forming a government in Thuringia because other parties are unlikely to work with it. The AfD came a close second in Sunday's other big state election, in the more populous neighbouring state of Saxony.  Results there gave the CDU 31.9% of the vote, just ahead of the AfD, again far ahead of the three parties running the national government - the Social Democrats, Greens and liberal FDP. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the results were ""bitter"" and called on other mainstream parties to form state governments without the far right.  ""The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country's reputation,"" he said in a statement to Reuters. The AfD's top candidate in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, who is a highly controversial figure in Germany, hailed a ""historic victory"" and spoke of his great pride. He failed to win a direct mandate for the state parliament, but secured a seat because he was top of his party list. Mr Höcke's party has been designated as right-wing extremist and he has been fined for using a Nazi slogan, although the former history teacher denies knowingly doing so. One of Germany's best-known Holocaust survivors, Charlotte Knobloch, pointed out that the election had taken place 85 years to the day since the outbreak of World War Two. The result had left the country in danger of becoming ""more unstable, colder and poorer, less safe and less worth living in"", she said. With federal elections only a year away, the AfD is second in national opinion polls. Co-leader Alice Weidel said the result was a ""requiem"" for the three parties running Germany and it was clear that voters in both eastern states wanted her party in government. ""Without us a stable government is no longer possible at all,"" she said. That message was repeated by Björn Höcke, who suggested there were plenty of CDU voters who would be happy if they worked together. Without the support of other parties, the AfD cannot govern in Thuringia, and the CDU has made clear it will not consider ruling with the far right.  Mathematically, the conservatives will need support from parties on the left to form a majority. Some five million Germans in the east were eligible to vote on Sunday and, according to a survey for public broadcaster ZDF, 36% of under-30s in Thuringia voted for the AfD, far more than any other party. The biggest issue for AfD voters on Sunday was immigration, and in particular the issue of refugees and asylum.  “Politicians have promised a lot, particularly concerning migration and foreigners,"" AfD voter Michael told the BBC in Thuringia's state capital, Erfurt. ""But nothing happened. Nothing. Just promises came from these parties. Now I have my party. And I stand with my decision,"" he said, standing beside his partner Manuela, who agreed that people wanted change. The asylum issue was re-ignited nationally little more than a week before the vote, when three people were murdered at a street festival at Solingen in western Germany, and a Syrian man facing deportation was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack. AfD deputy leader Beatrix von Storch told the BBC's Newshour programme that political opponents had been attacking her party's asylum policies as extremist for years. ""Two days ahead of the election they started to do what we always said had to be done,"" she said, referring to a series of government measures aimed at toughening asylum laws. The AfD also wants to stop weapons supplies to Ukraine, as does a new party heading for third place in both states, left-wing populist leader Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW. Although she has similar ideas to the AfD on Ukraine, Ms Wagenknecht has, like the other parties, refused to take part in any coalition with the far right. Provisional results in Thuringia give the AfD 32 seats in the 88-seat Thuringia state parliament, and the CDU 23 seats, with only one of the three parties in the national government represented.  That gives the AfD more than a third of the seats, handing it a blocking minority on decisions that require a two-thirds majority, including changes to the state constitution or appointing judges. Chancellor Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) is set to win just six seats, with none for the Greens and liberal FDP.  In Saxony, the conservatives won 42 seats, just ahead of the AfD with 41, while Sahra Wagenknecht's party is in third with 15 seats. Sunday's elections have underlined the unpopularity of Germany's ruling ""traffic-light"" coalition, so named because of the red, yellow and green of the party colours.  A third eastern state, Brandenburg, is due to vote in three weeks' time and although the AfD is ahead in the opinion polls, the Social Democrats and conservatives are only a few points behind. While Björn Höcke hailed his party's victory with supporters in Erfurt, anti-AfD protesters gathered outside the Thuringia state parliament. The AfD has been classified as right-wing extremist by domestic intelligence in Thuringia as well as Saxony. In May, a German court ruled that the BfV intelligence agency was justified in placing the AfD under observation for suspected extremism. Among the protesters was Hannah, a local student, who said she was very worried by the result: ""I think there are a lot of people who are aware they have Nazi policies and don't care. Germany has some kind of responsibility on that matter."" The rise of Sahra Wagenknecht's populist party had a direct impact on the Left party, which won the last election in Thuringia but has now slipped into fourth place. Bodo Ramelow, the Left-party state premier of Thuringia, who had led a coalition with the SPD and Greens, said the election campaign had been characterised by fear and that he was ""fighting against the normalisation of fascism""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58m308glro,Top-level meeting shows China - and Xi - still a priority for Biden,"Jake Sullivan is on his first visit to China as national security adviser, for talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",27 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:28:47.919634,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Jake Sullivan has been welcomed to China on his first visit as US national security adviser. He will hold talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi as the two countries try to stabilise relations. Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have met four times over 16 months in Vienna, Malta, Washington and Bangkok. Their last meeting in January was shortly after a high-stakes summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden that sought to reset frosty ties.  This week's talks - scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday - signal that China is still a priority for the Biden administration, even as the retiring president enters his final  months in office.  Both Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have already acknowledged a need to find common ground after disagreements between their nations. Could another presidential summit be on the cards?  The White House is trying not to explicitly link Mr Sullivan's trip to the US presidential election. But it's hard to ignore the timing.  If Mr Sullivan is able to lay the groundwork for a final Biden-Xi summit, his trip would tie up the ends of the US president's most consequential - and fraught - foreign policy relationship.  US and Chinese diplomats always acknowledge that talks between Washington and Beijing are never easy. And there is a lot to talk about.  With the unexpected turn the US election has taken with Biden bowing out in favour of Kamala Harris, China is watching closely for what the next presidency might have in store. Donald Trump has made it clear he will raise tariffs further on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the trade war he kicked off in 2019.  While Mr Biden's administration saw merit in diplomacy, he didn't reverse Trump-era tariffs and has added more - in May he announced steep duties on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, and steel.   Mr Biden has also strengthened alliances across Asia to combat China’s rising influence and beefed up Washington’s military presence - which, in turn, has rattled Beijing.    So far, the Harris campaign has not given many clues about how she plans to manage the relationship with China.  And the White House has made clear that Mr Sullivan's visit is meant to continue the work of the Biden administration, rather than set the tone for the next president. But China is likely looking ahead anyway.  Beijing will use this opportunity with Mr Sullivan to clarify its own priorities. It will hope that all parties in America are listening - China's ministry of foreign affairs has described this as a “critical juncture” between the world’s two biggest economies. For China, the red line is and always will be Taiwan. It claims the self-governing island and has repeatedly said it will not tolerate any signs that Washington is encouraging Taiwanese independence.  High-profile diplomatic visits, such as a controversial one by then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022, or recognition of Taiwan's elections or its elected leaders, fall into that category.   Chinese state media has said Beijing will focus on expressing grave concerns, stating its position, and making serious demands on matters such as the ""Taiwan question"". China will also have some strong words for Mr Sullivan on trade. Beijing has described US tariffs on Chinese goods as “unreasonable” and has urged Washington to ""stop politicising and securitising economic and trade issues"" and ""take more measures to facilitate people-to-people exchanges between the two countries"". When he came to power, Mr Biden wanted to set ties with China on an even keel after what he saw as the chaos and unpredictability of the Trump White House.  His administration has wanted to “responsibly manage” rivalry with Beijing; to demonstrate American power and competition with China through stealth not bravado. But that strategy has been upended amid the turbulence of events.  Last year, crisis engulfed the direct relationship when an American fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over US territory.  The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have further sharpened the tone.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing in April with a warning -   Washington would act if China did not stop supplying Russia with microchips and machine parts to build weapons used in its war in Ukraine.  He accused his Chinese counterparts of ""helping to fuel the biggest threat"" to European security since the Cold War. His warning materialised with a raft of sanctions on Chinese firms over their alleged support of the Russian military.  This is a tricky subject that China keeps trying to bat away, but Washington is insistent, and Mr Sullivan is likely to bring it up again. China's increasing assertiveness in Asia has also made the US wary of the impact of those ties further afield - particularly with Iran, which allies itself with Moscow and also arms Israel’s adversaries.  Finally, in America, there is the devastating domestic impact of Chinese-manufactured ""pre-cursor"" chemicals to make synthetic opioids like fentanyl, overdoses of which are killing more Americans than ever and the crisis has laid waste to entire towns. Last year’s summit between Mr Biden and Mr Xi in San Fransisco was meant to make progress on these issues.  Since then, despite the tariffs and the stern rhetoric, Washington and Beijing have acknowledged their differences - and reports of the two sides striking a deal on curbing fentanyl production are a good sign. In April, when the BBC accompanied US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his visit to Shanghai and Beijing, the public elements of some of his meetings with senior Chinese officials felt like a steely stand-off.  It was a show of diplomatic strength meant for each side's domestic audience. And this will undoubtedly be a part of Mr Sullivan’s trip too, as he tries to bolster Mr Biden's diplomacy in the waning months of his presidency.  But these meetings serve another fundamental purpose - face-to-face time between two rival, inter-dependent economies as they battle mutual distrust and try to probe each other’s real intentions. It seems that Jake Sullivan's previous meetings with Wang Yi have quietly laid the groundwork for what both sides call “stable relations”. In a recent speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington, Mr Sullivan said that he and Mr Wang had ""increasingly gotten to the point of setting aside the talking points and really having strategic conversations”. He described the character of those conversations as “direct”, including one on the war in Ukraine.  ""Both of us left feeling that we didn’t agree or see eye-to-eye on everything but that there was a lot of work to carry forward.”"

Ryan Evans, 38, from Wrexham, was in the east of the country with a news crew from Reuters news agency when the hotel they were staying in was hit by a missile on Saturday.  Mr Evans attended Ysgol Morgan Llwyd school before joining the Army and serving in the Royal Welsh regiment.  A former colleague said he was the ""most humble guy"" who knew the risks of the industry but put others first. Mr Evans was one of six Reuters staff staying at the Hotel Sapphire in Kramatorsk - which is under Ukrainian control but near the front line - when it was hit. Ukrainian authorities say the hotel was struck by a Russian missile. Russia has not commented. His body was recovered from the rubble on Sunday after a 19-hour search. Richard Elton, a close friend and former colleague of Mr Evans who had worked with him overseas, said it was ""sad and heart sinking when it's close to home"" despite risks being ""what we expect in our game"". He told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast Mr Evans was “the most humble guy I’ve ever come across"", adding: ""He’d listen to anybody and always put everybody before himself."" ""Ryan's a great guy. He's strong Welsh heritage. If we could take anything away, it's the grace of his presence, that's what we've got to hold close to our hearts.” Explaining the job his friend had been doing, Mr Elton added: “In simple terms, we're enablers. We get people into places where the normal run of the mill person wouldn't go. We put that protective bubble around a client so they can achieve their work mission. ""If it's a journalist, we get them as close and as safe as possible, advise them in the best way we possibly can... you need to look to us guys to pull you through.” Posting on Facebook, Mr Evans' wife, Anne, said he would be missed by all his family, including his four children, the youngest just 18 months old. ""I can't even begin to explain how much that man meant to me, how much I adored him with every part of me. ""He was my best friend and my soul mate, my everything,"" she said. She described him as a ""knight in battered armour"" because ""he was in shiny armour once, but he had been through more battles than I can even count"". ""He was such a gentle giant. If anyone needed anything ever he was there. He would always put others first and himself second,"" she added. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Mr Evans's death and offered his ""sincere condolences to his family and loved ones"".  Tributes have also been paid by staff at Ysgol Morgan Llwyd, a Welsh-medium school in Wrexham. Head teacher Catrin Pritchard said: ""I extend my most sincere condolences to Ryan's family and friends. ""Although Ryan had left Ysgol Morgan Llwyd, several members of staff still remember him extremely fondly as a very likeable person, with a big heart."" Mr Evans joined the Royal Welsh after school, serving in Iraq and reaching the rank of corporal. He later trained as a close protection specialist, accompanying journalists and aid workers into hostile environments. Chris Hunter, a bomb disposal expert and colleague of Mr Evans, described him as a ""natural warrior"". ""He was exceptional, a really lovely guy - tough, strong and fierce, but kind and funny,"" he said, adding that Mr Evans' ""bravery and dedication were unmatched"". ""He deeply cared for those around him and was committed to making the world a safer place. ""Despite his formidable presence, he treated everyone with kindness and respect. ""His loss leaves a void that cannot be filled,"" Mr Hunter added.  The Ukrainian General Prosecutor's Office wrote in a statement that the hotel had probably been hit with a Russian short-range Iskander-M missile. Kramatorsk is only about 20km (12 miles) from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, and has come under regular attack, with civilians killed. A spokesperson for Reuters said: ""We are devastated to learn that Reuters safety advisor Ryan Evans, who was with our reporting team in Ukraine, has been killed. ""Two of our journalists are in hospital; one is being treated for serious injuries. Three other colleagues have been accounted for and are safe."" The spokesperson added that the news agency was ""urgently seeking more information about the attack"". ""We send our deepest condolences and thoughts to Ryan's family and loved ones. ""Ryan has helped so many of our journalists cover events around the world; we will miss him terribly,"" they added."

But it had not stopped her and hundreds of others making their way up to an exposed rooftop for an open-air musical display of defiance in the heart of Kyiv. “I heard on the radio the Americans were warning that the Russians will bomb you today, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, they want to kill us',"" she said, as the setting sun illuminated the patterns of her traditional outfit, the vyshyvanka.

As a dozen orchestral musicians, clad in black, pumped out high-octane takes on classic Ukrainian tunes, I mentioned one thing that is different from their last two Independence Days at war: Ukraine has now entered and taken Russian territory.  “When we saw this news from Kursk, from Russian region, it was an amazing event. It's like a miracle for us. We are so happy with it,"" Ms Vyshnivska said.  She said the fate that Russians on the border were now suffering, displaced and in danger, was a natural consequence of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two and a half years ago. “From that moment on we started hating them and now... we want to kill them. And it’s awful. I understand that it's not okay for humans to say this, but we hate them, and we can’t think in any other way because they want to kill us.” President Volodymyr Zelensky, who attended a number of Independence Day events in the capital, gave a pre-recorded address from the Sumy region – just across the border from the newly gained Russian territory. ""Russia waged war on us. It violated not only sovereign borders, but also the limits of cruelty and common sense,” he told his people. “It was endlessly seeking one thing: to destroy us. And what the enemy brought to our land has now returned to its home."" Nearly three weeks into the Kursk incursion, Ukraine has consolidated much of the Russian land it seized rapidly in the surprise operation. An estimated 10,000 elite Ukrainian troops burst across the border on 6 August, taking more ground in a matter of days than Russia had won in Ukraine so far this year. Since the operation began, the BBC has kept in touch with one of the Ukrainian fighters now in Russia. In his latest messages to us, Serhiy - a pseudonym - revealed that the situation was tougher now. “Russia has gotten stronger. We see this in the number of strikes by drones, artillery, and aviation. Their sabotage and reconnaissance groups began to operate too,” he wrote. All meant the Ukrainians were taking more casualties, he said.  “At the beginning of the operation, we were on the rise. We had minimal losses. Now, because of the Russians’ firepower, we are losing a lot of guys. Moreover, the Russians here are fighting for their land, just as we are fighting for ours.” Serhiy says his earlier elation is giving way to some scepticism. “Many of us do not understand the meaning of this operation. It's one thing to fight for Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia.  It's a different matter for the Kursk region, which we don't need.” President Zelensky had said the Kursk operation aimed to capture Russian soldiers - which led to a prisoner swap and the release of 115 Ukrainians on Saturday - among other goals he could not disclose.  He had also said the operation was a preventative strike to deter Russian attacks towards Sumy.  Despite the sense of justice and retribution the Kursk incursion has brought, it remains a risky strategy for Kyiv. The rapid gains must be considered alongside losses in the east of Ukraine, where Russia continues to make ground in a grinding battle. Moscow’s troops are drawing nearer to the city of Pokrovsk, which was home to around 60,000 before the fighting. It is one of the biggest cities in the Donetsk region still under Ukrainian control and is an important hub for the defending forces. “It’s a really difficult situation,” 23-year-old Nazar Voytenkov, a former TV journalist who is now a volunteer with the 33rd Mechanised Brigade defending Pokrovsk, told us on a crackly phone line. I asked if he was aware of Russians troops being diverted to defend their own soil. “No, no, I don't feel that. I think Russians have a big resource of troops in the Kursk region and elsewhere in Russia, and they’re using them in this operation that the Ukrainian forces started."" I asked if it had relieved any pressure on Ukrainian troops in the area - a key hope of Kyiv's.  “I don't feel like it’s become easier. We still have enemies in all directions and just last week, they tried again to approach,"" he explained. “They used approximately 10 armoured vehicles and infantry to capture our positions, but we made a nice defence. We won this battle, and now we wait for their next fight. So no, they're still here.” This weekend’s celebrations were undoubtedly invigorated by the recent success on Russian soil, but Ukraine’s path to next year's Independence Day is no clearer and remains lined with danger and uncertainty. “This is just a monotonous, monotonous genocide,” Oleksandr Mykhed, one of Ukraine's leading authors, declared quietly. We met him in a cavernous exhibition building that used to house a museum to Lenin. He had just finished a lecture on his new book, which examines how the country’s great classical writers would consider the latest Russian invasion. You would be hard pressed to find a better location to symbolise Ukraine’s evolution since becoming independent in 1991 and its determination not to be dragged back into Moscow’s orbit. Of the Russians, Mr Mykhed said: “They want each and every missile strike to be called ‘another missile strike’. They want the whole world to get used to it and to make it routine, to make it ordinary. So that it would be the ‘ordinary genocide'.""  I asked him what hope Ukrainians could cling to as they endured the coming 12 months until their next Independence Day.  “This is time for a clear understanding of what the true patriotism is. And we know what it is like,"" he said.  His argument was that despite the mental and physical scars and deep collective grief, everyone had a duty to be strong and ensure Ukraine’s survival. “You might be tired for sure, everything might be depressed, but still - you have to save your country,"" the Ukrainian author said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c985ppy0znyo,Telegram boss banned from leaving France in criminal probe,"He has been placed under formal investigation as part of a probe into organised crime on the messaging app, French prosecutors say.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:00.920735,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Telegram boss and founder Pavel Durov has been placed under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime on the messaging app, Paris prosecutors say. Mr Durov, 39, has not been remanded in custody, but placed under judicial supervision, and has to pay a €5m (£4.2m; $5.6m) deposit. The Russian-born billionaire, who is also a French national, also has to show up at a French police station twice a week and is not allowed to leave French territory. Mr Durov was first detained upon arrival at Le Bourget airport north of Paris last Saturday under a warrant for offences related to the app.  In Wednesday's statement, the Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was put under formal investigation over alleged offences that included:  In France, being put under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily result in a trial - but it indicates that judges consider there is enough of a case to proceed with an investigation. Mr Durov has so far made no public comments on the latest developments. His lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, said Telegram complied in every respect with European digital regulations and was moderated to the same standards as other social networks. It was ""absurd"" to suggest his client could be involved ""in criminal acts that don't concern him either directly or indirectly"", he added. It is unprecedented for the owner of a social media platform to be arrested because of the way in which that platform is being used, and it has fuelled a fierce debate online about freedom of speech and accountability.  We have previously seen tech bosses hauled in front of lawmakers for confrontational grillings about their practices and failings, but not met by law enforcement at airports. Elon Musk, the owner of X, has defended Mr Durov, arguing that moderation is a ""propaganda word"" for censorship. He has called for Mr Durov's release.  Chris Pavlovski, the founder of a controversial video-sharing app called Rumble, said he had fled Europe following Mr Durov’s detention. While most of the world’s largest social networks do engage with national and international bodies when it comes to serious criminal offences such as the sharing of child sexual abuse images, Telegram is accused of ignoring them.  The firm, which is now headquartered in Dubai, insists that its moderation tools meet industry standards. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week that France was deeply committed to freedom of expression, and that the decision to hold Mr Durov was ""in no way... political"". Huge groups of up to 200,000 people can share and comment on information and content on Telegram - WhatsApp on the other hand limits its maximum group size to just over 1,000. While Telegram messages can be encrypted, meaning that only the sender and recipient can view them, this is not activated by default and has to be manually switched on to private chats. On Monday evening, Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was being held in custody as part of a cyber-criminality investigation. In response, Telegram said Mr Durov had ""nothing to hide"". Russia has warned France against turning the case into what it described as a ""political persecution"", having previously said that without serious evidence the charges could be construed as an act of ""intimidation"". ""We know that the president of France has denied any connection [to the case] with politics,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday, according to Reuters.  ""But on the other hand, certain accusations are being made."" Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said that the charges against Mr Durov sounded ""wild"" and that the Telegram CEO was a ""hostage of the dictatorship of democracy of the collective West"".  Telegram is ranked as one of the major social media platforms.  It was founded in 2013 and is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet Union states, as well as Iran. Russian war correspondent Sasha Kots wondered whether users would ever ""trust Telegram as before"". Kots, who regularly posts updates about the war in Ukraine to his large Telegram following, suggested that French and Western authorities might now have access to the network's encryption keys. ""The truth is that no matter how events around Durov develop now, one can never be sure of the security of the messenger,"" he wrote on Telegram. The BBC revealed on Wednesday that Telegram - which has more than 950 million registered users - has repeatedly refused to join international programmes aimed at detecting and removing child abuse material online. The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment about its refusal to join the child protection schemes. Mr Durov, who also founded the popular Russian social media company VKontakte, left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform. He also holds passports of St Kitts and Nevis and the United Arab Emirates."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nykdnlkpo,Russia and Ukraine swap prisoners after Kursk offensive,The swap is the first since Ukraine first began its incursion into Russia on 6 August.,24 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:01.016055,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia and Ukraine exchanged 230 prisoners of war on Saturday, weeks after Ukraine launched a cross-border attack into the Kursk region of Russia.  The Russians released on Saturday were captured in Kursk, Russian state news agencies reported, citing the country's defence ministry.  The ministry said 115 soldiers were returned ""from territories controlled by the Kiev regime,"" while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said ""another 115 of our defenders have returned home today"".  It is the first such swap since Ukraine first began its incursion into Russia on 6 August. Kyiv has said one of the goals of the Kursk offensive is to capture Russian soldiers to trade for Ukrainian prisoners of war. Ukraine claims to control over 1,000 sqkm of the Kursk region. The United Arab Emirates reportedly mediated the swap.  Separately, on Saturday Ukraine said it had carried out an attack on a Russian ammunition depot in the southern Russian region of Voronezh. Kyiv also reported that five people had been killed in a Russian strike on the eastern town of Kostyantynivka.  President Zelensky said the returned Ukrainian soldiers were members of the National Guard, the Armed Forces, the Navy, and the Border Guard.  ""We remember each and every one. We are searching for and making every effort to bring everyone back,"" he said. ""This brings closer the release of our military, our civilians from Russian captivity. Thanks to our team and partners, the UAE for our people returning home,"" he said. Mr Zelensky said that in addition to capturing Russian soldiers, the Kursk operation had other goals he could not disclose.  The Ukrainian president said the operation was a preventative strike to deter Russian attacks towards Sumy, a city in Ukraine. He added Ukraine would do everything to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war through diplomacy. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xl5vnlzpwo,Is US economy better or worse now than under Trump?,"BBC Verify looks at jobs, inflation, stocks and other indicators to compare the Trump and Biden economies.",3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:01.110350,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"It has been a recurrent theme of this US presidential campaign - has the US economy performed better under Joe Biden or Donald Trump? “By many indicators our economy is the strongest in the world,” Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has claimed. Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, says he created the ""greatest economy in the history of our country"", and the Biden-Harris administration has ruined it. We have looked at some key indicators to compare economic performance under the two presidencies. Although the impact of Covid has made comparison difficult, both presidents can count some notable economic successes despite wages struggling to keep up with price increases in recent years. First, let's look at economic growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services in the US economy.  There was a dramatic collapse in this figure during Covid as many businesses shut. Following the pandemic, the economy bounced back strongly under Trump and recovered better than many other western countries. This has continued under Mr Biden, with the US producing the strongest pandemic recovery within the G7 as measured by GDP. But over Trump's four years in office, it was not the greatest economy in US history, as he likes to claim. Between January 2017 and January 2021, average annual growth rate was 2.3%.  This period includes the slowdown and recovery of the economy as a result of the Covid pandemic. Under the Biden administration so far, this figure is 2.2% - so almost the same. There have been periods in the past when GDP growth was significantly higher than the average under both Trump and Biden, such as in the 1970s. The rate at which prices are rising has been a big issue in the campaign. Prices rose significantly during the first two years under Mr Biden - hitting a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Trump has said the US has experienced “the worst inflation we've ever had”.  But that's not true - inflation was last above 9% in 1981, and it has been much higher than that at several other points in US history. Inflation has now fallen to around 3% - but it remains higher than when Trump left office. Grocery prices, for example, increased by 13.5% over the year ending in August 2022.  This was the peak under the Biden administration, and prices have stabilised somewhat since, with the cost of groceries rising by 1.1% from July 2023 to July this year. The recent trend is comparable with many other Western countries which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues driven by Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. But some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) American Rescue Plan, which passed in 2021, was also a factor - as the injection of cash into the economy led to prices rising further. The Biden administration has repeatedly pointed to strong job growth as a major achievement. Before big job losses in 2020 due to Covid, in the first three years of Trump's presidency almost 6.7 million jobs were added, according to data for non-farm jobs (which covers about 80% of workers in the labour force). There's been an increase of almost 16 million jobs since the Biden administration took over in January 2021. Mr Biden claims this is the “fastest job growth at any point of any president in all of American history”. That’s correct - if you look at the available data since records began in 1939. But his administration has benefited from a sharp rebound in economic activity as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns. “Many of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,” says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. This spending plan passed under the Biden administration in 2021 was designed to help stimulate the economy following the pandemic. Weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they've since stabilised. Both administrations have pointed to low unemployment levels under their leadership.  Prior to the pandemic, Mr Trump delivered an unemployment rate of 3.5%. As in many parts of the world, Covid lockdown measures led to soaring levels of unemployment in the US - but the unemployment levels had dropped back down to around 7% when Trump left office. Under the Biden administration unemployment continued to fall to a low of 3.4% in January 2023 - the lowest rate in more than 50 years - but it it has since ticked up to 4.3%. In terms of wages, these did rise under Trump but at a similar rate to his predecessor Barack Obama, up until the pandemic hit. Workers’ wages increased rapidly at the start of 2020 during the Covid pandemic - but the sudden uptick in wages was linked to lower paid workers being more likely to be laid off, which raised the average wage of people who were still employed. Under Mr Biden, average weekly earnings have grown, but they have struggled to keep up with the increase in prices caused by high levels of inflation. When adjusted for inflation, average weekly wages are less than when Mr Biden came into office.  The US stock market isn't necessarily a reflection of the broader economy, but many Americans have investments, so its performance holds some importance. The Dow Jones Index is a measure of the performance of 30 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. It reached record highs during Trump’s presidency, but crashed as markets reacted to the pandemic, wiping out all the gains made under Trump.  However, the financial markets recovered to above pre-pandemic levels by the time Trump left office in January 2021. They have continued to grow under Mr Biden, and although there have been recent wobbles, they have reached record levels under his administration as well. Graphics by Tommy Lumby.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dp5v6l902o,Ozempic 'slows ageing' and Jenas 'battling to save marriage',Several papers focus on a new finding that weight loss jobs may slow down standard markers for ageing.,31 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:01.188763,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"""Is weight loss drug the secret to the fountain of youth?"", asks the Daily Express.  It says that a ""raft of groundbreaking studies"" have found that semaglutide - which is sold under the brand name Ozempic - could be used to treat ""a wide range of conditions"".   According to the Times, that could include illnesses linked to arthritis, Alzheimer's and even cancer. The Daily Mirror quotes one expert as saying he would not be surprised if it also helped to ""slow ageing"". The Daily Telegraph says millions could benefit - adding that the findings will put pressure on the NHS to roll Ozempic out more widely. Sources tell the Guardian that Thames Water has lobbied the government to intervene - and potentially overrule the regulator - to allow the company to increase customers' bills.  It is what the paper calls ""the latest tactic in an increasingly desperate scramble"" to repair the firm's ""threadbare finances"" and avoid being nationalised. Those familiar with discussions say advisers and board members have warned Whitehall officials that allowing that to happen would have a ""chilling effect"" on the UK's appeal to international investors. Thames Water has declined to comment. The Telegraph reports that pub bosses have been warned that ministers could introduce minimum alcohol pricing in England. A source tells the paper that a senior government figure floated the idea at an event, saying that the industry needed to ""get its act together"" and do more to tackle the harms of alcohol. The government insists it has no plans to introduce such a measure. According to the Times, defence officials fear that ministers could announce cuts to large military projects in the Autumn statement. Referring to Sir Keir Starmer's speech earlier this week - in which he warned things would get worse before they got better - a source tells the paper that ""every time the prime minister speaks"" it sounds less and less likely that defence will be given more money. The government says it will set out the path to investing 2.5% of GDP in defence ""as soon as possible"". The front page of the i weekend highlights the results of a poll, which has found that a majority of people believe ministers are not doing enough to help with high energy bills. The paper declares that ""Labour's honeymoon period appears to have come to an abrupt end"", with the survey also showing declining support among voters. The Daily Mail leads with claims that Princes William and Harry ""did not share a word"" when they attended a funeral service for their uncle. It says the occasion is not thought to have led to a reconciliation between the estranged brothers, after witnesses said they left without speaking. Describing it as a ""cold reunion"", the Sun says the ""warring pair"" were ""so distant"" - despite at one point standing ""virtually back to back"". And many of the papers feature images of the deputy prime minister at a nightclub in Ibiza. According to the Sun, thousands of partygoers cheered on ""Angela Rayner the raver"" as she ""showed off her moves"". Writing in the Mail, the Conservative former culture secretary Nadine Dorries condemns the scenes as ""ill-judged and utterly adolescent"". But the Mirror crowns Ms Rayner ""the queen of clubs"" for ""putting the party into party politics"". Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."

They face hosts Denmark, Norway and Japan in the final qualifying event in Aalborg between 29 August and 1 September, with the winner sealing a place at the 2026 Winter Games in Milan. GB won all three of their matches - against China, Serbia and Romania - in the initial qualifying series in February, but will have to overcome higher-ranked opponents to reach the Games. Great Britain are currently ranked 17th in the world, whereas Denmark - who reached the quarter-finals at the 2022 Winter Olympics - are 11th and Norway 12th. Japan are 24th. Head coach Pete Russell said it was the biggest challenge he had faced since taking up the role in 2015. ""Itâs a super hard challenge to play Pool A nations after eight months of a season, never mind with such short preparation time, but our players will give it everything they have,"" he said. Great Britain have won two Winter Olympic medals in ice hockey - bronze in 1924 and gold in 1936. Women's ice hockey was introduced at Nagano 1998, but Great Britain have not qualified for a Games. Each team plays each other once with the overall winner booking their ticket to the 2026 Winter Olympics. Fixtures (all times BST): Thursday, 29 August Norway v Japan - 14:30 Denmark v Great Britain - 18:30  Friday, 30 August  Norway v Great Britain - 14:30  Japan v Denmark - 18:30 Sunday, 1 September  Great Britain v Japan - 11:30  Denmark v Norway - 15:30 There will be 12 teams in the men's competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics and, for the first time since Sochi in 2014, NHL players will be allowed to compete for their countries. Eight countries have already booked their places, with hosts Italy joined by the top nations based on the 2023 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) world rankings - Canada, defending Olympic champions Finland, United States, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Czech Republic. Russia competed as the Russian Olympic Committee at the last Games in Beijing - and won the silver medal - but they, and Belarus, are currently banned for the 2024-2025 season. The IIHF cited security reasons because of the war in Ukraine and has set a deadline of May 2025 for its ruling council to decide whether Russia and Belarus can return in time for the 2026 Olympics. Should Russia be allowed, they would qualify as the ninth country to participate, based on the world rankings. The final three spots will be decided at three separate events taking place this weekend. Apart from Great Britain's event in Demark, there are also final qualifiers in Slovakia and Latvia. In Bratislava, hosts Slovakia face Kazakhstan, Austria and Hungary, while hosts Latvia play France, Slovenia and Ukraine in Riga."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28xrzzrxqo,"India ready to help find peace, Modi tells Ukraine",PM Narendra Modi pays a historic visit to Kyiv and says he is prepared to play a role to bring peace.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:01.366859,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has paid a historic visit to Ukraine, telling President Volodymyr Zelensky he is prepared to play a personal role to bring peace. The Indian leader was criticised by President Zelensky last month when he hugged Russia's President Vladimir Putin during a trip to Moscow on a day of deadly Russian strikes, including one on Kyiv's biggest children's hospital. Mr Modi, 73, said he had told Mr Putin that problems could not be solved on the battlefield. ""Both sides will have to sit together and to look for ways to come out of this crisis,"" he said after meetings in Kyiv. Mr Modi arrived in the Ukrainian capital by train from Poland, the first international leader to visit since Ukraine forces crossed into Russia's Kursk region in early August, seizing more than 1,250 sq km of territory, according to the military. Six weeks ago, President Zelensky had spoken of his “huge disappointment” at watching Mr Modi warmly hug the Russian leader. On Friday it was the Ukrainian leader's turn to be embraced by Mr Modi – although it appeared a more awkward greeting. Mr Zelensky appeared to frown, but equally it may have been the sun in his eyes. Smiles were few and far between. More than 40 people had died in Russian strikes on the day Mr Modi had visited Moscow. Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv took a direct hit. It was surely no coincidence that the first place Mr Modi was taken on Friday was Ukraine’s history museum where he was invited to watch an exhibition remembering all of the 570 Ukrainian children reported to have been killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Both leaders crouched down to place soft toys at a makeshift shrine, and India’s prime minister said later his heart was filled with grief at the young people “martyred” in the war. At one point he put his arm around the Ukrainian president's shoulders - an image posted on Mr Modi's social media account with the message that his heart went out to the families of children who had died. Later on came his personal offer to help initiate peace talks, with Mr Modi stressing only dialogue and diplomacy would end the fighting.  India had never been neutral in the war, he insisted. ""Right from the first day our side was peace,"" Mr Modi argued, pointing out that he came from the land of Mahatma Gandhi, whose statue in Kyiv he visited earlier. But behind the language, the fact remains that India has never condemned Russia’s full scale invasion and, in effect, has been helping to power Moscow’s war economy with Delhi overtaking Beijing last month as the biggest importer of Russian oil – at a time it has been hit by Western sanctions. Mr Modi and President Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s ongoing incursion into Russian territory, although the content of that specific conversation is not known. India did take part in a Ukraine-led peace summit in Switzerland in June, to which Russia was not invited, and Mr Zelensky urged Mr Modi to sign up to a joint communique that highlighted the territorial integrity of Ukraine and all other states. However, he thanked his visitor for “supporting our sovereignty and territorial integrity”, a sentiment that Mr Modi repeated shortly afterwards – as both men hailed it an historic day. They went on to release a joint statement, pledging to build on the two countries' relations in defence and trade."

The free event, on Friday, was organised by Ukraine Aid and Welfare founder Antonina Grebeniuk, one day before the official national celebration. ""Independence Day holds a special place in the hearts of every Ukrainian, both at home and around the world,"" Ms Grebeniuk said in a speech. The day, hosted by Bristol City Council, included traditional music, food and a ""powerful"" exhibition highlighting the ongoing conflict. The celebration, on 24 August, marks 33 years since Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union. The event has taken on a particular significance for Ukranians forced to flee the country to live abroad after Russian forces invaded in 2022. After a moment of silence, the Ukrainian flag was raised outside Bristol City Council. Attendees then formed a ""chain of unity"" around College Green, ""symbolizing the strength and solidarity of the Ukrainian community and their allies in Bristol"", explained Ms Grebeniuk.  She added that the exhibition, called Ripped from the Face of the Earth, was ""vital for our community, highlighting the ongoing devastation in Ukraine"". Ms Grebeniuk, who also founded Ukrainian School Bristol, said the day provided a ""safe environment"" to help welcome Ukrainians to the city. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c785z8917leo,Pokrovsk: Ukraine's vital eastern town in Russian sights,Pokrovsk is a major logistics hub with a railway station and lies at the intersection of important roads.,29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:01.525494,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The town of Pokrovsk plays a crucial role as a logistics hub used by Ukrainian forces in the eastern region of Donbas. It is home to a key railway station, and it is located at the intersection of several important roads. Russian forces have for months sought to capture the town, but their advance has quickened in recent weeks and they have seized the village of Novohrodivka about 10km (6 miles) to the south east. Before the war, Pokrovrsk was home to some 69,000 residents, with many of them employed in coal mining, metallurgy and machine-building. It sits adjacent to another mining town, Myrnohrad, which is even closer to the front line and is coming under fierce bombardment. Thousands have fled the Russian advance on Pokrovsk in recent months, but families with children have been ordered to evacuate too. Civilians were running out of time to leave, Serhiy Dobriak warned. Ukraine had hoped that by seizing territory in Russia's Kursk region it would be able to divert Russian troops away from their eastern advance, but that has not happened. If anything the Russian offensive on Pokrovsk, and Toretsk further to the north east, has intensified. ""Pokrovsk is a very important hub, a centre of defence. If we lose Pokrovsk, the entire front line will crumble,"" military expert Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov warned. Ukraine relies on the town's rail and road infrastructure to provide supplies and reinforcements to its troops on the eastern front line, as well as to evacuate the wounded.  Losing Pokrovsk to Russian forces would mean these vital military tasks would become far more complicated. It would also increase the risk to other strategically important towns, such as Chasiv Yar, which sits atop commanding heights giving control over the wider area. ""If they cut our logistics, then Chasiv Yar will be doomed,"" says analyst Pavlo Narozhny. ""It will be a matter of time before we'll have to pull out of it because we won't be able to supply our fighters there."" Pokrovsk has always played the role of an important railway centre serving the needs of Ukraine's heavily industrialised east.  In fact, it grew around a station built in the late 19th Century. It became known as the coal-mining capital of Ukraine after the capture in 2014 of Donetsk, the main city of Donbas, which stands for ""the Donetsk coal basin"". Pokrovsk is home to Ukraine's largest producer of coking coal. It is vital for metallurgy, which, in turn, plays a key role in the country's economy.  Metals were Ukraine's main export product before Russia's full-scale invasion two and a half years ago, accounting for 23% of total goods exports.  Their export value has now shrunk to a quarter of that level as the country's industry has been ravaged by the war. A Ukrainian soldier stationed in Pokrovsk told the BBC's Ukrainecast podcast that the large number of industrial buildings in Pokrovsk and neighbouring towns such as Myrnohrad were very helpful to Ukrainian defences. ""They will have a huge challenge to get this area because it's a very industrialised area with pretty significant defence lines,"" said the soldier, identified as Ostap. Asked about the potential consequences of the fall of Pokrovsk, he said: ""Total destruction of these cities and a lot of people dead, and a lot of suffering."" ""After that there will be more cities, so I really hope that we will stop them on the outskirts of Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk."" The capture of Pokrovsk would have symbolic significance, too.  The Kremlin's media machine would use it to counterbalance the embarrassment of Ukraine's capture of territory in Russia's Kusk border region. It would also be a significant step towards the full occupation of Ukraine's Donetsk region, which Russia declared as part of its territory back in September 2022."

Bluebell ward, at Walton Hospital in Chesterfield, has undergone a £2.8m refurbishment as part of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust’s £150m Making Room for Dignity programme. But although the revamped ward will open in September, the health trust has acknowledged there have been ""challenges and delays"" to other parts of the project. The trust said issues with wet weather, cost inflation and energy prices had increased costs, ""resulting in some amendments to schedules"". All six units were intended to open by the end of 2024, but are now not expected to be completed until April 2026. The trust said that the war in Ukraine was one factor, as some of the raw materials for the works, such as steel, were due to come from Russia. Making Room for Dignity projects in Chesterfield and Derby are comprised of three new builds and three refurbishment projects. The trust said the programme is intended to end dormitory-style accommodation for inpatient care and will provide better access to psychiatric intensive care units (PICU). The first facility in the programme to open, Bluebell ward, will provide mental healthcare for 12 older adults. The ward's rooms have en-suite bathrooms, and patients can use calm breakout spaces so they feel more like they are ""checking into a hotel"", the trust said. An occupational therapy garden has also been created at Bluebell ward, with help from Chesterfield College students. The trust said that Derbyshire has a high number of mental health wards using dormitory-style accommodation, which ""negatively affect mental health, reducing privacy and safety"". Derbyshire is also the only region in England currently without a local PICU, and patients needing this type of care are having to be placed ""out of area"", often far from their homes. The programme's three new builds are the Derwent unit, at Chesterfield Royal Hospital as well as the Carsington unit and Kingfisher House, both located at Kingsway Hospital in Derby. The two other refurbishment projects are the Radbourne unit, at the Royal Derby Hospital and Audrey House, also at Kingsway, Derby. Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4ngydm1x55o,Saddling up on the high seas - the cyclists powering 50-mph yachts,A world champion cyclist has swapped the velodrome for the cramped deck of the fastest yacht in the world. Why?,3 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:08.568186,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Saddling up on the high seas - the cyclists powering 50-mph yachts Sitting on a bike and pedalling is something Simon van Velthooven has done for countless kilometres and hours during his cycling career. He has done it well, winning Olympic, World and Commonwealth medals on the track. He still pedals a bike for a living, but the New Zealander's life as a 'cyclor' on a sailing boat in the America's Cup is now very different. ""You're just getting shaken around, holding on while you're turning some cranks that are veering a lot,"" Van Velthooven tells BBC Sport. ""It's RPM [revolutions per minute], power, watts, cadence, shaking, high turbulence, getting punch-drunk by whacking your head on the walls and trying to look at your numbers on your screen, and listening to all the comms of the sailors and what they're doing and trying to anticipate your energy levels coming up to the next manoeuvre."" Van Velthooven is among the wave of cycling experts that have crossed over to the world of sailing before the 37th edition of the America's Cup - the oldest international sailing competition in the world - this autumn in Barcelona. Traditionally everything above the waterline on the 75ft-long boats - the sails, mast and winches - was powered by grinders, sailors who used their arms to turn cranks. Yet technological rule changes for this year's competition have reduced crew sizes from 11 people to eight, but with the proviso that any body part can now be used to create power. As legs can typically produce more power than arms, cyclors have been brought in and static pedalling systems installed on the boats. Teams estimate they have since seen a 25-30% gain in watts produced per athlete by using the lower part of their body rather than upper. Cyclors are not entirely new. They were also used during in the 2017 staging of the America's Cup in Bermuda by Emirates Team New Zealand, which is how 35-year-old Van Velthooven was initially recruited to sailing from cycling. The Kiwis were outliers during that competition as the only crew to try the technology, although it was to great effect as they won the Cup. They retained the title in 2021 when rules required a return to grinders. This time around the cyclor technology is being used by all six competing teams. Van Velthooven (crouched, far right) was one of the cyclors on Emirates New Zealand's ground-breaking 2017 victory America's Cup: Schedule, guide and Ainslie's quest for historic win This year's America's Cup boats - known as AC75s - are ""designed to fly"" across the water on a foiling monohull, racing at speeds of up to 50 knots (58mph). For athletes with no experience of sailing, seasickness is an obvious first hurdle they need to overcome before they can become a cyclor. Two athletes were unwell during trials with New York Yacht Club American Magic and were dropped. ""They've got to be able to perform in somewhat high-G [force] situations when the boat's getting spun around,"" says Terry Hutchinson, president of sailing operations at American Magic. ""Then they've got to be able to perform day in, day out in the sun and heat of Barcelona. It takes quite a unique athlete to achieve that."" Cyclors are not built the same as the professional cyclists at the Tour de France or Olympics. For cyclists, body weight and watts per kilogram are key to how they perform. However, cyclors do not need to pull themselves up a mountain or around a track. They simply need to produce as big a wattage as possible when the boat needs it. ""There are some unique things we are looking for in this particular sport,"" says Ben Day, head performance coach of the American Magic team. ""When we're talking about Tour de France cyclists, we're maybe looking at someone who is 60kg up to 75-80kg. All of our guys are running 90kg and above. ""It's a bit of a unique skillset. We have guys who are super strong and we're just looking for absolute power."" Former cyclist Ashton Lambie, like Van Veltooven, has swapped over to sailing purely for his credentials on a bike. Lambie is a former individual pursuit world champion. In 2021, he became the first rider in history to break the four-minute barrier for a 4km-long effort round the track. He joined the American Magic team after a trial and his body shape has changed considerably over the last two years since. ""Even by cycling standards I was a fairly big guy, I am moderately well known for having big legs and they've gotten bigger since I've come here,"" Lambie says. ""During my racing career I was probably between 70 and 74kg, and now I've gained over 10kg. Most of it is muscle, and I've also gained watts. It's been a really big change."" Ashton Lambie won an individual pursuit world title in 2021 in Roubaix, but the 33-year-old now brings his power to a different kind of vehicle Lambie, 33, says the only similarity to cycling is that the cyclors are pedalling in the same motion as on a regular bike. ""The pedalling feels very different and the overall sensations of moving on the water, either laterally or vertically, is wildly different from any kind of cycling,"" Lambie says. ""When you go through a corner on the track the banking pulls you in and the G-force pushes down on you - that's a very natural feeling when you lean into the corner. ""But on a boat it's like you're upright and somebody just whips the boat around so you're getting slammed, it's a purely lateral load. ""It looks quite static and stable when you're watching it on TV but the boat really moves a lot. ""We do a lot of stability work and mobility work in the gym and that definitely translates over to the boat when you're getting jostled around a lot and you still need to be able to pedal. ""The times when the boat's a little unstable, you're getting thrown around the most, that's when it's most important to pedal. Being able to put out power even when you're not in an optimal pedalling position is huge."" Ineos Britannia lost out to Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli to be the challenger for the America's Cup the last time it was held, in 2021 The races take place across head-to-head events that are split into two parts.  The first part - the Louis Vuitton Cup - determines which of five challengers will face this year's defending champion Emirates Team New Zealand in the second, the America's Cup itself. Races take approximately 25 minutes and this year start in August and end in October. Endurance is the key metric for cyclors, who need to be able to consistently produce a high wattage during the races themselves and maintain their form across 10 weeks. ""We just want a huge reliable engine for the three months that we're going to be racing,"" Van Velthooven says. ""Big days are big days and easy days are still big days because they still need heaps of power. It's relentless."" The UK's Ineos Britannia team, led by Sir Ben Ainslie, might not have recruited professional cyclists to their crew like some of their rivals but they have the next best thing - an affiliation with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team, formerly Team Sky and winner of seven Tours de France. Matt Gotrel is part of Ineos Britannia's crew. This year will be his second America's Cup, but his first as a cyclor rather than grinder. A former Olympic gold medal-winning rower, having been part of Great Britain's eight at Rio 2016, Gotrel has found it a ""big challenge"" to train a different muscle group, even if recreationally he considered himself a cyclist already. ""As rowers, we had an upside-down pyramid [body shape] before, but it's flipped around now,"" Gotrel says. As grinders, his crew would aim to produce 400 watts of power over 20 minutes. As cyclors they are now ""well north of that"". Training for the past two years has predominantly taken place on the road or in the gym, rather than on water. Volume blocks can consist of four to six-hour-long rides, three times a week, interspersed with high-intensity intervals on a static bike and weight training. Gotrel, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, compares powering the boats in a race to a cycling time trial, but with repeated sprint efforts throughout. ""You want to have a really good aerobic base where you can sit at as high a power as possible without producing too much lactate, and then you have your big spikes and  need to be able to recover from those,"" he says. The connection to Ineos' cycling team has been a ""massive"" resource for Gotrel and his fellow cyclors, enabling them to share training and nutritional insight on a training camp in Spain together. ""I had a chat with [sprinter Elia] Viviani about some sprinting technique, and then there are Filippo Ganna and Dan Bigham who have been really good on some of the strategy and fuelling things and what they did to push on the hour record,"" says Gotrel Gotrel's training now takes in open roads as well as open water Hutchinson says the America's Cup is a ""design competition as much as a sailing competition"" and development of the boats has been a process lasting more than two and a half years. Part of the challenge has been incorporating the concept of a bike into a boat. Most teams have chosen to position the cyclors upright, as they would be on a regular bike - even if the 'bike' consists of just a seat, seatpost and crank. ""We started it by scanning a standard bike and putting that in a boat and seeing what position you'd need to put the cyclors in,"" says David Adcock, Ineos Britanniaâs lead mechanic. ""Some of the ideas we came up with at the start looked really strange from a cycling perspective - head down pretty much touching your feet - but we kind of went away from that and have gone back to a standard bike position that was best for getting power out."" In order to maximise the aerodynamics, the cyclors are below deck. They don't have much to look at beyond a screen showing their data. ""Trying to get someone who's 6ft 3in to fit has been quite challenging,"" says Adcock. ""We've got handlebars that we can move up and down to get them packaged in properly."" By contrast, the American Magic team have chosen to put the cyclors in the recumbent position, lying almost flat on their backs. ""It's the America's Cup and so it takes clever thinking to be successful. I would look to Team New Zealand's success in 2017 - they were the outlier then and they won the regatta,"" Hutchinson says. ""We're not afraid to be different, we understand the power requirements of the boat."" Barcelona will become the first city in the world to host both an Olympic Games and the America's Cup Adcock describes the AC75 as like an ""F1 car on water"" and the links between the America's Cup and Formula 1 are easy to find. Ineos Britannia share their UK base with the Mercedes team - where Ineos is also a sponsor. Adcock previously spent 22 years working for Mercedes before moving across in 2022. American Magic have also spent time with the Williams team to see how they work. Each boat can produce more than 3,000 data points within half a second and send them to engineers onshore for analysis in real time. ""The steering wheels look more like an F1 wheel with the functions on the wheel and how the boat's programmed to automatically shift mode. That side of it is very similar,"" says Hutchinson. ""If you're good at Call of Duty [video game] you're probably really good at sailing an AC75 because it's a similar controller."" Ineos Britannia are aiming to become the first British challenger to win the America's Cup The technological advancements in the sport have taken the America's Cup far away from the experience of most traditional sailors. The return of cyclors for this year's race has moved that dial even further. ""It's hard for the average sailor to relate to what we're doing,"" admits Hutchinson, who has been part of five America's Cups. ""They look at the boat and there are a lot of traditionalists out there who say 'this actually isn't racing'. ""But I bet you and I couldn't hop into an F1 car and understand how to turn the thing on. We understand the concept of the car, we know we can drive a car, but we probably can't drive one of those cars. I equate it to that. ""The America's Cup is a unique competition, it's always been at the tip of the sphere of the sport."" The crossover of cycling into sailing might seem incongruous, but at the heart of the two sports is a very similar culture, Day believes. That shared ground has made blending the two so successful. ""There seems to be a correlation between sailors who love toys and boats and cyclists who love bikes and toys,"" says Day. ""We all have this sense of freedom of getting out into nature with the wind in our hair. âWhether it's on a boat or on a bike, it seems to be something we can enjoy together.â Fury, hope and changing gear with a sword - Ukraine's Paris preparations Paralysed by an ex-boyfriend, Otto rises as Paralympian How a Facebook advert changed a life and the look of a sport East meets west London - the mentor who changed Chelsea East v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals"

He, along with 200 others in West Norfolk, volunteered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme offering to host Ukrainian families fleeing the Russian invasion of February 2022.  Ahead of Ukrainian Independence Day, King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council held a reception to thank host families. It was organised by Oksana Bransgrove, who works with locals and new arrivals to make sure they get the support they need.  Mr Gowland says his new arrivals were initially shocked when they arrived at his home in Heacham.  ""I think they were surprised when they saw the house, because it's rather large,"" he said. The husband, wife and little boy who came to live with him quickly settled in and remain there two years on. Richard says they got lots of help from local councils to find them work and a school.  ""He now goes to a school in Hunstanton where he's proved to be a star. So he's very happy. And the parents are happy as they have jobs,"" he said. There are a lot of organisations working to make sure Ukrainians and their hosts get the help they need.  Norfolk County Council co-ordinates the scheme but it district councils that do the home visits and offer day-to-day support.  Ms Bransgrove is helping them with learning English, accessing services and whatever help they need.  ""I think the Ukrainians have become a gem in King's Lynn because they are integrating,"" she said. ""They join in events and they are happy to be here. They're happy because they feel welcomed."" Oksana said the reception at King's Lynn Town Hall was ""a little thank you for a huge thing"". Rebekah Bensley-Mills is from the borough council’s Lily project.  It is a service designed to support any vulnerable person living in West Norfolk. She says some hosts have ended up feeling like their new additions are truly part of the family.  ""I've been amazed. We've had hosts who have not only given them a room, access to a kitchen and a bathroom... the bare essentials... but who have put them on their car insurance, helped them find a job, got their children into school,"" she said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj35lk4x86yo,The lonely death of a jailed Russian pianist who opposed war,"When a Russian prisoner swap hit headlines recently, a jailed musician’s fatal hunger strike went unnoticed.",25 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:08.780516,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"While the US and Russia were busy finalising the biggest exchange of prisoners since the Cold War, a gifted but little-known Russian pianist was dying in silence in jail. Pavel Kushnir had protested repeatedly against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and began a hunger strike soon after his arrest in May, later refusing water too. He died, slowly and without publicity, on 28 July - four days before a group of better-known dissidents were swapped for Kremlin spies, sleeper agents and killers imprisoned in the West. After his lonely death, at a pre-trial detention centre in Birobidzhan in Russia’s Far East, the 39-year-old was mourned by only 11 people at his cremation. Svetlana Kaverzina, an independent politician in Siberia, said no-one had tried to talk him out of sacrificing himself because they hadn’t been aware what was happening. “We couldn’t chip in and send him a lawyer - we didn’t know,” she wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “He was alone.” The YouTube channel where Kushnir published four anti-war videos had only five subscribers when he was arrested. His “Foreign Agent Mulder” posts were a reference to a character in the US TV series, the X Files, which was popular in Russia in the 1990s, and also to a Russian law that allows people considered politically suspect to be declared “foreign agents”. In one clip Kushnir even appears with a hand-drawn FBI badge. His final film, released in January, addressed the 2022 massacre of civilians by Russian troops in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. A few months later, a Telegram channel close to the secret services, Operational Reports, posted a video showing masked men leading Kushnir into a white minivan. It added that a criminal case had been opened, accusing him of making a public call to engage in terrorist activity, which is punishable by up to seven years in jail. Nothing more was heard until 2 August, when the human rights activist Olga Romanova and the pianist’s friend, Olga Shkrygunova, revealed his death in an article published by online news organisation Vot Tak. His 79-year-old mother, Irina Levina, later confirmed her son had died. Kushnir was born in Tambov, central Russia, where his father Mikhail was a pianist and educator, and his mother a music school teacher. He started playing piano at the age of two and, at just 17, gave a remarkable two-and-a-half-hour concert featuring the 24 preludes and fugues by composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Later that year, he was admitted to the Moscow Conservatory, where classmate Julia Wertman says he cultivated a “dissident image”, often wearing a shabby coat and black clothes, with a half-litre bottle of vodka sticking out of a pocket. Asked in a 2005 interview what composition he would never perform, he replied: ""The Russian national anthem."" After graduation, Shkrygunova says Kushnir deliberately took jobs in smaller cities, believing he would have more musical and personal freedom outside Moscow. He moved to Yekaterinburg, then Kursk, and spent three years in Kurgan, a city to the east of the Ural mountains, before he lost his job at the philharmonic orchestra there in 2022. Shkrygunova does not know exactly why he was dismissed, but adds: ""This was a cog that didn’t fit any machine, and it had been that way since his childhood."" After four months without a job, he became a soloist with the Birobidzhan Philharmonic, telling local television: “If I’m not imprisoned, drafted into the army, or fired, then I hope to spend the next 12 years with you."" Kushnir spent his free time protesting against the war. In emails to friends he described sticking posters around Birobidzhan at night, with slogans angrily denouncing the draft, and describing Vladimir Putin as a fascist. He also began staging hunger strikes: first for 20 days in the spring of 2023, then for three months later that year. Shkrygunova says Kushnir knew the danger he was putting himself in. ""It was his solitary protest,” she says. “An act by someone who didn't know what else he could do.” She tried to convince him to leave Russia, or at least to perform in Berlin, where she now lives. But they never managed to arrange the trip. In late March, Kushnir spoke to Shkrygunova for the last time, telling her he felt like he was being watched and that he “kept seeing the same person”. “Whatever happens, happens: I'm doing this for a reason,” he added. Birobidzhan City Court records contain no information about a criminal case against him, though there is a record of a non-criminal case of “petty hooliganism” submitted on 20 June. On 19 July, Kushnir was fined an unknown amount, but it is unclear whether he attended the hearing. The court then sent him a copy of the verdict, but it was returned on 30 July with the note “not possible to deliver”. By then, of course, Kushnir was already dead. The independent news site, Mediazona, spoke to someone who saw him shortly before he died. They described him as ""like a skeleton"", who by mid-July could barely walk and was ""in very poor condition"". The official cause of death was ""dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure"". The FSB and the Birobidzhan Court did not respond to the BBC’s request for comment. The regional head of Russia’s prison service, Vasily Mikhaylenko, told Mediazona he knew nothing about the case. After Kushnir’s death, his mother told another independent news organisation, Okno, that she had tried and failed to influence her son. “I certainly wanted him to conduct himself in a quieter way and stay out of politics altogether. “I am very sorry that he gave up his life, apparently for nothing at all.” But Shkrygunova disagrees, saying that Kushnir knew all along that he was risking his life so that he could express his anti-war views. “He understood there might have been another way,” Shkrygunova adds. “But by the time he had realised it, there was no turning back. He knew he was going to go all the way – so it wouldn’t turn out to be a wasted effort.” In death, Kushnir has attracted more attention than he ever received in his lifetime. A book he wrote in 2014 has quickly been republished in Germany.  Grace Chatto, a member of Grammy-award-winning electronic music group Clean Bandit who studied with Kushnir at the Moscow Conservatory, wrote an emotional tribute on Instagram to her “gentle and funny” friend.  And 22 leading classical musicians including Daniel Barenboim, Sir Simon Rattle and Martha Argerich wrote an open letter to remember a “remarkable artist” they had never met. Although Kushnir’s YouTube channel had single-figure subscribers in his lifetime, his most popular clip has now been viewed more than 22,000 times."

Alex Ryzhuk, a 20-year-old Irish citizen born to Ukrainian parents, travelled to Ukraine after turning 18, according to the Irish Times. Mr Ryzhuk, from Dublin, had been serving alongside military forces in east Ukraine as a volunteer, but it is understood he was reported missing in recent weeks. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the case and was providing consular assistance. “As with all consular cases, the department does not comment on the details of individual cases,” the department said. In an interview with The Irish Times in May, Mr Ryzhuk said that after training in Kyiv he joined the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, operating as a drone pilot, and was deployed to Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Kharkiv. In a recent RTÉ' Prime Time interview, Mr Ryzhuk said he intended to return to Ireland to join the Defence Forces after the war in Ukraine concluded.

Fergus MacInnes, 18, Daisy Livesey, 20, and Emile Gonder, 20, spent the summer refurbishing a Mitsubishi Shogun and a Nissan X-Trail, with the help of mechanic Craig Whitley. The cars are now ready for their new role as ambulances or casevac (casualty evacuation) vehicles on the front line, where they will be used to bring injured soldiers to safety. The friends will drive the vehicle to Ukraine via Paris and Dresden, Germany, before returning on flights from Poland. The group fundraised £6000 to pay for the conversions needed to make the cars ready for their new role. ""We've added some really great front lights for when it's driving in the dark,"" said Fergus. ""New all-weather tyres, and then a new radiator, just generally making it mechanically sound, and all that work's been fantastically done by Craig Whitley.  ""We're incredibly grateful for the work he's done.  ""He's done it all free of charge."" Fergus was inspired to contribute to the work of Mission Ukraine after spending two months volunteering in the country earlier this year. ""I heard a lot of awful stories about those who unfortunately didn't make it back from the front for lack of casevac vehicles,"" he said. ""And that's really been obviously a huge inspiration to provide them."" The team will set off for Ukraine later. ""I'm pretty excited, just very excited for the opportunity to help get people off the front line and back to their families,"" said Emile. ""Really, that's a big motivation."" Mission Ukraine is British-Ukrainian charity which has delivered more than 30 casevac vehicles to Ukraine so far. Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e9zrywq9o,Diplomatic tightrope for Modi as he visits Kyiv after Moscow,Modi is visiting Ukraine just weeks after his Russia trip. Is it a balancing act or is there something more?,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:09.198084,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Ukraine to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The trip comes just weeks after he met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The visit is significant because Kyiv and some Western capitals had reacted sharply to Mr Modi’s visit to the Russian capital in July. Mr Zelensky was particularly critical, saying he was “disappointed to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow”. So, is Mr Modi visiting Kyiv to placate Mr Zelensky and other Western leaders? Not entirely. It’s not surprising to see India balance its relations between two competing nations or blocs. The country’s famed non-alignment approach to geopolitics has served it well for decades. Friday's visit - the first by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine - is more about signalling that while India will continue to have strong relations with Russia, it will still work closely with the West. Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre think-tank in Washington, says the trip will further reassert India’s strategic autonomy. “India isn’t in the business of placating Western powers, or anyone for that matter. It’s a trip meant to advance Indian interests, by reasserting friendship with Kyiv and conveying its concerns about the continuing war,” he says. However, the timing of the visit does reflect that Indian diplomats have taken onboard the sharp reactions from the US to Mr Modi's Moscow visit.  India has refrained from directly criticising Russia over the war, much to the annoyance of Western powers. Delhi, however, has often spoken about the importance of respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. It has continuously pushed for diplomacy and dialogue to end the war. Mr Modi’s Moscow visit in July came hours after Russian bombing killed at least 41 people in Ukraine, including at a children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking a global outcry. The Indian PM said the death of children was painful and terrifying but stopped short of blaming Russia. Mr Modi is not likely to deviate from this stance during his visit to Kyiv. The US and other Western nations have grown to accept Delhi’s stand, given India’s time-tested relationship with Moscow and its reliance on Russian military equipment. India, the world’s largest importer of arms, has diversified its defence import portfolio and also grown domestic manufacturing in recent years but it still buys more than 50% of its defence equipment from Russia. India has also increased its oil imports from Russia, taking advantage of cheaper prices offered by Moscow - Russia was the top oil supplier to India last year. The US and its allies have often implored India to take a clearer stand on the war but they have also refrained from applying harsh sanctions or pressure. The West also sees India as a counterbalance to China and doesn’t want to upset that dynamic. India, now the fifth largest economy in the world, is also a growing market for business. Mr Kugelman says the West will welcome the visit and see it as Delhi’s willingness to engage with all sides. “Mr Modi has a strong incentive to signal that it’s not leaning so close to Moscow that there’s nothing to salvage with Kyiv,” he says. This is important because India wants to keep growing its relations with the West, particularly with the US, and wouldn't want to upset the momentum. Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador to India, recently said the relationship should not be ""taken for granted"". India also needs the West as China, its Asian rival, and Russia have forged close ties in recent years. While Delhi has long viewed Moscow as a power that can put pressure on an assertive China when needed, it can't be taken for granted.  Meanwhile, many media commentators have spoken about the possibility of Mr Modi positioning himself as a peacemaker, given India’s close relations with both Moscow and the West. But it’s unlikely that he will turn up with a peace plan. “Is India really up to it, and are the conditions right? India doesn’t like other countries trying to mediate in its own issues, chief among them Kashmir. And I don’t think Mr Modi would formally offer mediation unless both Russia and Ukraine want it. And at this point, I don’t think they do,” Mr Kugelman adds. Ukraine, however, will still welcome Mr Modi’s visit and see it as an opportunity to engage with a close ally of Moscow, something it hasn’t done much since the war began. Mr Zelensky, though, is unlikely to hold back his criticism of Mr Putin in front of the Indian PM. Mr Modi can live with that as he has faced such situations many times in other Western capitals. Moscow is not likely to react to the visit as it has also been making concessions for Delhi’s multilateral approach to geopolitics. But beyond reasserting its non-alignment policy, Delhi also has bigger goals from this visit. India has been ramping up engagement with Europe in the past decade, particularly with the underserved regions in Central and Eastern Europe. Delhi wants to keep consolidating its relations with the big four - the UK, Italy, Germany and France - but also wants to boost engagement with other countries in Europe. Mr Modi is also visiting Poland on this trip - the first Indian PM to visit the country in 45 years. He also became the first Indian prime minister to visit Austria in 41 years in July. Analysts say that this signals India’s growing understanding that Central European nations will play a bigger role in geopolitics in the future and strong relations with them will serve Delhi well. The Indian government has also revived trade deal negotiations with Europe. It has signed a trade and investment deal with the European Free Trade Association, which is the intergovernmental organisation of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. So, while there will be a lot of focus on the war during his visit, Indian diplomats are likely to stay focused on the bigger goal. “Central and Eastern Europe now have greater agency in writing their own destiny and reshaping regional geopolitics. Mr Modi’s visit to Warsaw and Kyiv is about recognising that momentous change at the heart of Europe and deepening bilateral political, economic and security ties with the Central European states,” foreign policy analyst C Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper, summing up Mr Modi’s wider goal."

Roman, 16, came to Coventry with mum Svitlana after Russian forces gave them a day to leave the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. He sat exams in five subjects at West Coventry Academy, including maths, English and construction, and hopes to become a car mechanic. ""I'm definitely treating my son with whatever he wants,"" Svitlana said, after he opened his results envelope live on BBC CWR, having, she explained, started ""from the bottom"" learning English. When the family left Ukraine they fled to Poland, gaining a visa to move to the UK. ""The envelope doesn't matter to me,"" Svitlana said of the results. ""I'm already proud of him, it was a great job."" His highest grade was a three in maths, the equivalent of a D under the former GCSE grading system. Roman said: ""When I came here I don’t know English I just know 'hello' and 'bye'. ""Now I can speak English with my friends, with my auntie, with my brother."" The car-obsessed teen said he had done better in his GCSEs than he expected and was looking forward to enrolling at Coventry College to study vehicle mechanics. ""I done my best, my very best – everything is better than I would like,"" he explained. He described Coventry as ""a great city"" and predicted he would be ""a great mechanic"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd05385k722o,'The cash came up to my torso' - tales of a match-fixer,"Moses Swaibu was one of the brightest prospects in Crystal Palace's youth ranks, but he ended up in a shady world of cash, danger and fixing rather than football's limelight.",10 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:16.494397,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"'The cash came up to my torso' -  tales of a match-fixer The hotel lift gently levelled out and a muffled ding sounded. The doors slid back. What Moses Swaibu saw next has stayed with him ever since. ""We were going to the room at the end of the corridor,"" he says. ""I just remember that colour red, it was a really royal type of colour. ""And the place smelled expensive, you took a breath in and it was like 'damn this environment ain't how outside is'. It felt like a film set."" Swaibu, having drunk a whisky cocktail for courage in the bar, was at The May Fair hotel in central London, walking towards the biggest decision of his life. As he strode down the corridor, Swaibu didn't know exactly what was behind that final door. But he knew enough. It would be a criminal, cash and a career that betrayed everything he had worked for. Once he crossed that threshold, there would be no turning back. But, by the time Swaibu reached the door, any doubts had long since gone. ""Going into that meeting, there was nothing that could have got in the way,"" he tells Confessions of a Match Fixer, an eight-part podcast on BBC Sounds. ""I knew there may be 60 grand there and I was willing to take it by any means necessary."" Swaibu knocked and entered. Swaibu joined Crystal Palace's youth set-up as a 16-year-old, having not been previously connected to a professional club Not all doors opened as easily for Swaibu. Back in his youth, after his parents split up, Swaibu and his older brother were raised by their father in Croydon in south London. It was a strict upbringing. Swaibu's father insisted on respect, manners and hard work. ""I never really had the best relationship with my dad,"" says Swaibu. ""My school would finish around three o'clock and he would tell me that if I wasn't back home by 4:30, the door would be locked. ""That door didn't open until 9am the next morning."" Often Swaibu would miss the curfew. He spent evenings playing football, before riding London's night bus network, criss-crossing the city. He slept in stairwells. Or relied on neighbours to let him crash on their floor. LISTEN: Confessions of a Match Fixer ""One house I went into, I slept on a mattress and could see loads of needles on the floor,"" he says. ""You have to remember I was 12 or 13, you don't know what things like that are."" Swaibu did know football though. Battling his brother in small-sided games gave him a mentality beyond his years. Quiet and shy off the pitch, he relished a tackle on it. Aged 16, he was plucked out of a trial game, and did well enough during pre-season training with Crystal Palace to earn a youth contract. He joined a talented crop of prospects. A few years below, John Bostock had clubs all around Europe plotting to sign him. Victor Moses, who would go on to play for Chelsea and Liverpool, was also in the system. A couple of weeks after his 18th birthday, Swaibu was alongside both in a marquee on the Selhurst Park pitch. It was Palace's annual awards evening and the whole club - first team, office staff, grounds staff and a select few die-hard fans - were there. Swaibu was the only attendee to be called to the stage twice though, winning Young Player of the Year and Scholar of the Year. Swaibu poses with Crystal Palace's Vice Presidents Young Player Of The Year award at the end of the 2006-07 season ""I remember the chairman at the time came up to my mum and said 'we've really got big plans for Moses',"" says Swaibu. He made his Selhurst Park debut for Palace's first team three months later, coming off the bench in a pre-season friendly against Premier League Everton. Mikel Arteta and Andy Johnson were among the opposition. There were 20,000 fans in the stands. Swaibu replaced future Portugal international Jose Fonte for the final 10 minutes. ""I remember thinking 'this is the moment I have worked so hard for, so much has happened in my life, please God protect me in this game',"" he says. It never got better than that though. Managers changed and Swaibu's stock dropped. New boss Neil Warnock thought Swaibu was lightweight and too easily dominated in the air. After a loan spell at Weymouth, he was released by Palace in May 2008 - just a year on from his awards night success. Swaibu was picked up by League Two Lincoln City and spent two years with the club, a spell during which he says he was approached by match-fixers, but didn't rig games The May Fair hotel wasn't the first time Swaibu had been approached by match-fixers. Eighteen months before, in January 2011, he had sat at the back of the Lincoln team coach with a duffel bag containing Â£60,000-worth of euro notes. It had been offered to Swaibu and three of his team-mates by ""a guy who looked like something stereotypical from a film, a scary Russian bad guy"". It was theirs to keep if they could ensure Lincoln were 1-0 down against Northampton at half-time of their League Two match. Unbeknown to the rest of the team, Swaibu and the other three brought the money into the changing room.  Ultimately, they didn't fix the match, in fact most of the potential conspirators were on the bench for the game anyway. They returned the money and stayed quiet. By August 2012 though, Swaibu, now 23, had slipped further down football's ladder. He was playing for Bromley in the National League South - the sixth tier of the English game. The profile was lower, but the pressure was personal. Swaibu's girlfriend was pregnant. ""In my mind, the most important thing in my life was making sure that I could pay for everything that I was under pressure to provide,"" he says. ""My daughter couldn't come into the world while I am on the back foot."" So when, during a post-training warm-down, a team-mate asked him if he wanted to come to a ""meeting"" the next day, Swaibu got on the front foot. He agreed. He travelled into London. He strode down the hotel corridor. He crossed the threshold. ""I opened the door and this guy - the guvnor, the main guy - was like 5ft standing up,"" remembers Swaibu. ""He sat down on the bed, turned his back to us, lit up a cigarette and started doing something on his laptop. ""I remember thinking 'bro, you can't smoke in this hotel'. ""He didn't speak English so there was a translator - probably 20, slim, glasses. He offered us a drink and then he got straight to the point."" The point was simple. Bromley had to lose the first half of their forthcoming match against Eastbourne 2-0. Do that, and the syndicate's bets would have come in. And, in the second half, Swaibu and his four fellow fixers could play normally. The bribe would be Â£100,000 to share. ""I knew my team-mates were hesitant, but, leading up into that game, I was like 'I am doing it',"" says Swaibu. And he did. Swaibu wins a header during a 2013 spell with Sutton United In front of 655 fans, Bromley conceded a penalty in the 40th minute of the first half - given away by a player who knew nothing of the fix - and, into stoppage time before the break, were penalised for a handball in the box. Eastbourne converted both spot-kicks and Swaibu had cashed in. ""We went into the dressing room at half-time and the gaffer says, 'what the hell is going on?',"" he says. ""I went on my phone and there was just a thumbs up emoji from the translator. ""I thought this is just way too good to be true."" Swaibu had fallen down the football pyramid, but he was soon climbing the criminal ranks. As well as organising fixes at Bromley, he identified players who might be able to do the same elsewhere. ""I would find out who the most influential player is, who is captain, who is vice captain, who has been there for more than two years, who is on a second or third stint at the club, how many games have they played in the last two years,"" he says. Swaibu was a middleman, liaising between the fixers and a pool of around 50 players, organising meetings and distributing cash. ""I would go to established businesses - say a restaurant - open up a locked door that would look like a toilet or a store cupboard and find piles of money stacked up,"" he says. ""It would be a lot. It was piled up to my torso and I am 6ft 3in. I would bundle it up in rubber bands and seal it with cling film. ""I would be carrying a big bag - like I was going to the gym - but, it was a towel over the top and then just cash underneath. ""One night, I brought home Â£500,000. ""It made me so paranoid. I didn't wear anything flashy, I rarely drove, I was always thinking, who else is on this train? What might my neighbour have seen? ""But despite the paranoia, I liked it. ""I was getting money fast and quick - 45 min and 90 min - that became an addiction. But it wasn't the money after a certain stage, a lot of it came from power."" One evening, at a meeting in a restaurant, the fixers fired up a laptop and showed Swaibu how the cogs fitted together. ""They showed me this platform which had our team names and how much money was being bet on them live, in play,"" he says. ""You could see the odds on the market moving up and down, red and green. It was in Chinese, but if you converted into pounds, for one game, there was a million riding on it."" It wasn't just the fixers who were keeping a close eye on the market though. Swaibu's occasional underperformance - ""maybe one step to the right of where you should be or two steps to the left"" - wasn't raising suspicions. It was the dramatic movement of money instead. Swaibu never made a competitive appearance for Palace, but appeared in several friendlies and was an unused substitute for a Championship game against Watford Bookmakers, usually protected and in profit thanks to margins and finely-tuned odds, were losing on National League South. They were seeing floods of money on certain teams' games from newly-opened accounts located all over the world - tipsters who would bet exclusively on the English sixth tier and with unerring accuracy. More money was reportedly placed on the total goals in one November 2012 National League South game than on the equivalent market for a Champions League match involving Barcelona. Bookmakers started refusing to take wagers on some teams, scrubbing them off the coupon. The Football Association launched an investigation into betting patterns in the division. As the season came to a close, the fixing was an open secret in some dressing rooms. Fans were suspecting their own players, accusing them from the stands. The situation couldn't last. The net was closing in. Swaibu's final Bromley fix - ensuring they lost an April 2013 fixture away to Maidenhead by two clear goals - bordered on farce. Swaibu gave their striker a clear run on goal to score the game's first. Into the second half, he stayed rooted to the ground as they scored again to lead 3-1. A team-mate scored in the 82nd minute to make it 3-2. Two minutes later, Swaibu held a needlessly high line, chased back aimlessly and allowed Maidenhead to make it 4-2. An incensed team-mate who wasn't in on the fix was sitting on the bench, telling the manager that something suspicious was unfolding in front of them. ""It was the first time it had been that blatant and obvious and I didn't want to face the dressing room,"" Swaibu says. ""I was a mouse. The bubble had popped in that moment. ""When I walked into the dressing room I couldn't look up. It was silent, everyone looking at me. ""The only thing I could hear was the gaffer - a grown man in his fifties - weeping. ""I didn't get in the shower, I just went straight to my car."" Swaibu left the club two games later, at the end of the season. He wasn't the only fixer who realised the National League South had come under too much scrutiny. A clutch of players left Hornchurch - another team in the league - and travelled around the world to play for Southern Stars, a lower-league team based on the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia. Their arrival didn't go unnoticed. Sportradar - a company hired to monitor and maintain the integrity of sports events - had suspicions. The players' social media posts from Australia, featuring extravagant holidays in Bali and high-end nightclubs, only heightened them. The Australian police were tipped off and the Southern Stars' dressing room, clubhouse and even goalposts were rigged with hidden microphones. Undercover officers posed as fans, phone calls were intercepted and bank transfers examined. It led to a string of convictions, a clutch of leads and, ultimately, a sting operation by the National Crime Agency in south London. By then, Swaibu could well have been out of the game, both legal and illegal. He says he had saved up around Â£200,000 from fixing football. And, at 24, playing football seemed to be over. Two short-term deals with Sutton and Whitehawk led nowhere. ""But I was addicted at this point, something was pulling me back in."" One of Swaibu's contacts had been tapped up by a new group of fixers - a gang trying to break into match-rigging and put together a network of players to pull it off. Swaibu had his suspicions. The new fixers didn't seem to know the rules. They seemed naive and inexperienced, with little idea of what was possible. They dropped names of other match-fixers they had worked with, when discretion and secrecy were key to Swaibu's previous bosses. Some were also white, British and middle-aged, an unlikely profile for hi-tech gambling conspiracies, invariably leveraged from Asia. Swaibu wanted to believe though. Because if they were new to fixing, they could be fleeced. Swaibu says he took a photo of his local five-a-side team and told the fixers they were players in his pocket. He invited his new contacts to a League Two match between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham and Redbridge and told them it was rigged. It would end, Swaibu said, in a 1-0 win for Wimbledon. Swaibu was arrested after accepting money from match-fixers after attending a game at AFC Wimbledon's Kingsmeadow home in 2013 He met Sanjey Ganeshan and Chann Sankaran - two match-fixing middlemen chasing players for their mysterious backers - in person for the first time in an alleyway down the side of Kingsmeadow. Initially, it went to plan. Swaibu, Ganeshan and Sankaran watched Wimbledon head down the tunnel at half-time with a 1-0 lead. Swaibu took the duo to a restaurant and demanded his Â£5,000 ""pocket money"" for attending the meeting and proving his credentials. But then things went south. Ganeshan and Sankaran saw on their phones that Dagenham and Redbridge had scored. The ""fix"" wasn't coming in. They argued with Swaibu. Swaibu went to leave. As he did so, some of his fellow diners looked up at him. The restaurant was strangely busy for a Tuesday night. And as Swaibu walked to his car, he was surrounded. ""I knew it was real when they put the plastic cuffs on me,"" he says. ""I knew it was game over."" The mysterious backers who had recruited Ganeshan and Sankaran weren't real though. They were a phantom syndicate created by the NCA. Swaibu served four months of his 16-month sentence in prison, another four months wearing an electronic tag and the final eight months on licence For Swaibu the door locked once more. He was sentenced to 16 months in April 2015 for conspiracy to commit bribery. During his time in prison he was visited by his two-year-old daughter, whose arrival had given him the motivation, or perhaps self-justification, to turn to the fixers in the first place. ""She came running into the visitors' hall, as two-year-olds do, and just ran straight towards me,"" says Swaibu. ""She didn't say anything, she just held me tight and didn't want to let go. For the next two hours I couldn't speak. ""After she had left I sat in that cell and I said to myself: 'Forget the money, forget football, forget everything, how do I go back to the beginning?'"" The past remains. But Swaibu is now using it to shape a better future for himself and the game he loves. Since his release, Swaibu has worked with football's world governing body Fifa, industry organisation Sport Integrity Global Alliance and the Premier League to understand the psychology and strategies of match-fixers. He also works with these groups to identify and safeguard individuals who are vulnerable to becoming involved in corruption.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0473y0p0ego,‘I never worked for the Russians’ - punished by Kyiv for being a collaborator,"Almost 2,000 people have been convicted of collaborating with Russia under a new Ukrainian law.",22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:16.593571,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“I don’t deserve to be here at all” is a protestation you would expect to hear from someone in prison. But, as she sits in her maroon overalls, Tetyana Potapenko is adamant that she is not who the Ukrainian state says she is. One year into a five-year sentence, she is one of 62 convicted collaborators in this prison, held in isolation from other inmates. The prison is near Dnipro, about 300km (186 miles) from Tetyana’s home town of Lyman. Close to the front lines of the Donbas, Lyman was occupied for six months by Russia and liberated in 2022.  As we sit in the pink-walled room where inmates can phone home, Tetyana explains that she had been a neighbourhood volunteer for 15 years, liaising with local officials  - but that carrying on those duties once the Russians arrived had cost her dearly. Ukrainian prosecutors claimed she had illegally taken an official role with the occupiers, which included handing out relief supplies. “Winter was over, people were out of food, someone had to advocate,” she says. “I could not leave those old people. I grew up among them.” The 54-year-old is one of almost 2,000 people convicted of collaborating with the Russians under legislation drafted nearly as quickly as Moscow’s advance in 2022. Kyiv knew it had to deter people from both sympathising and co-operating with the invaders. And so, in a little over a week, MPs passed an amendment to the Criminal Code, making collaboration an offence - something they had failed to agree on since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Before the full-scale invasion, Tetyana used to liaise with local officials to provide her neighbours with materials such as firewood. Once the new Russian rulers were in place, she says she was convinced by a friend to also engage with them to secure much-needed medicines. “I didn’t co-operate with them voluntarily,” she says. “I explained disabled people couldn’t access the drugs they needed. Someone filmed me and posted it online, and Ukrainian prosecutors used it to claim I was working for them.” After Lyman was liberated, a court was shown documents she had signed that suggested she had taken an official role with the occupying authority. She suddenly becomes animated. “What’s my crime? Fighting for my people?” she asks. “I never worked for the Russians. I survived and now find myself in prison.” The 2022 collaboration law was drawn up to prevent people from helping the advancing Russian army, explains Onysiya Syniuk, a legal expert at the Zmina Human Rights Centre in Kyiv. “However, the legislation encompasses all kinds of activities, including those which don’t harm national security,” she says. Collaboration offences range from simply denying the illegality of Russia’s invasion, or supporting it in person or online, to playing a political or military role for the occupying powers. Accompanying punishments are tough too, with jail terms of up to 15 years. Out of almost 9,000 collaboration cases to date, Ms Syniuk and her team have analysed most of the convictions, including Tetyana’s, and say they are concerned the legislation is too broad. “Now people who are providing vital services in the occupied territories will also fall liable under this legislation,” says Ms Syniuk. She thinks lawmakers should take into account the reality of living and working under occupation for more than two years. We drive to Tetyana's home town to visit her frail husband and disabled son. As we near Lyman, the scars of war are clear. Civilian life drains away and vehicles gradually turn a military green. Droopy power lines hang from collapsed pylons and the main railway has been swallowed by overgrown grass. While the sunflower fields are unscathed, the town isn’t. It has been bludgeoned by airstrikes and fighting. The Russians have now moved back to within nearly 10km (6 miles). We were told they usually start shelling at about 15:30, and the day we visited was no exception. Tetyana's husband, Volodymyr Andreyev, 73, tells me he is “in a hole” - the household is falling apart without his wife, and he and his son only manage with the help of neighbours. “If I were weak, I would burst into tears,” he says. He struggles to understand why his wife is not with him. Tetyana might have received a shorter sentence had she admitted her guilt, but she refuses. “I will never admit that I am an enemy of state,” she says. But there have been enemies of state - and their actions have had deadly consequences. Last autumn, we walked on the bloodstained soil of the liberated village Hroza in the Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine. A Russian missile had hit a cafe where the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier was taking place - it had been impossible to hold the service while Hroza was under Russian occupation. Fifty-nine people - almost a quarter of Hroza’s population - were killed. We knocked on doors to find children alone at home. Their parents weren’t coming back. The security service later revealed that two local men, Volodymyr and Dmytro Mamon, had tipped off the Russians. The brothers were former police officers who had allegedly begun working for the occupying force. When the village was liberated they fled across the border with Russian troops, but stayed in touch with their old neighbours - who unwittingly told them about the upcoming funeral. The brothers have since been charged with high treason - but are unlikely to be jailed in Ukraine. That is broadly the story of Kyiv's battle with collaborators. Those who commit more serious crimes - guiding attacks, leaking military information or organising sham referendums to legitimise occupying forces - are mostly tried in absentia. Those facing less serious charges are often the ones who end up in the dock. Under the Geneva Convention, occupying Russian forces have to allow and provide the means for people to continue living their lives. Just as Tetyana Potapenko says she tried to do, when troops moved into Lyman in May 2022. Her case is one of several we have uncovered across eastern Ukraine. They include a school principal jailed for accepting a Russian curriculum - his defence, his lawyer says, was that although he had accepted Russian materials, he didn’t use them. And in the Kharkiv region, we heard about a sports stadium manager facing 12 years in prison for continuing to host matches while under occupation. His lawyer says he had only organised two friendly matches between local teams. In the eyes of the United Nations (UN), these collaboration convictions breach international humanitarian law. A third of those handed down in Ukraine from the start of the war in February 2022 until the end of 2023 lacked a legal basis, it says. “Crimes have been carried out on occupied territory, and people need to be held to account for the harm they’ve done to Ukraine - but we’ve also seen the law applied unfairly,” says Danielle Bell, the head of the UN's Human Rights Monitoring Mission in the country. Ms Bell argues that the law doesn’t consider someone's motive, such as whether they are actively collaborating, or trying to earn an income, which they are legally allowed to do. She says everyone is criminalised under its vague wording. “There are countless examples where people have acted under duress and performed functions to simply survive,” she says. This is exactly what happened to Dmytro Herasymenko, who is from Tetyana’s home town of Lyman. In May 2022, he emerged from his basement after artillery and mortar fire had subsided. The front line had passed through Lyman, and it was under Russian occupation. “By that time people had been living without power for two months,” he recalls. Dmytro had worked as an electrician in the town for 10 years. The occupying authorities asked for volunteers to help restore power, and he stuck up his hand. “People had to survive,” he says. “[The Russians] said I could work like this or not at all. I was afraid of turning them down and being hunted by them.” For Dmytro and Tetyana, the relief of liberation was brief. After Ukraine took back control of the town, officers from the country’s security service - the SBU - brought them in for questioning. After admitting to having provided power to the Russian occupiers, Dmytro was swiftly handed a suspended sentence and banned from working as a state electrician for 12 years. We found him at the garage where he now works as a mechanic. Shiny tools reflect his enforced career change. “I can’t be judged in the same way as collaborators who help guide missiles,” he says. His protests echoed Tetyana’s. “What can you feel when a foreign army moves in?” she asked. “Fear of course.” Such fear is justified. The UN has found evidence of Russian forces targeting and even torturing people supporting Ukraine. “We’ve had cases of individuals being detained, tortured, disappeared, simply for expressing pro-Ukrainian views,” says the UN’s Ms Bell. From the moment Moscow invaded Crimea in 2014, the definition of being “pro-Russian” changed in the eyes of Ukrainian lawmakers - from simply favouring closer national ties, to supporting a Russian invasion seen as genocidal. That same year, Russian proxy forces - funded by the Kremlin - also occupied a third of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It is often the elderly who choose to, or are forced to, live under occupation. Some may be too frail to leave. There will also be those with Soviet nostalgia or sympathy with modern-day Russia. But given how Ukraine might one day have to reunite, does the collaboration law come down too hard? The message from one MP who helped draw it up is blunt: “You’re either with us, or against us.” Andriy Osadchuk is the deputy head of the parliamentary committee on law enforcement. He strongly disagrees that the legislation breaks the Geneva Convention, but accepts it needs improvement. “The consequences are extremely tough, but this isn’t a regular crime. We are talking about life and death,” he says defiantly. Mr Osadchuk believes it is, in fact, international law which has to catch up with the war in Ukraine, not the other way round. “We need to build Ukraine on liberated territories, and not make someone happy from the outside world,” he says. The UN monitoring mission admits there have been some improvements. Ukraine’s prosecutor general has recently instructed his offices to comply with international humanitarian law while investigating collaboration cases. Ukraine’s parliament is also planning to add more amendments to the legislation in September. One suggested change would see some people issued with fines instead of prison sentences. For now, Kyiv sees the likes of Tetyana and Dmytro as acceptable recipients of tough justice, if it means Ukraine can finally be free of Russia’s grasp. The pair claim they only regret not escaping when the Russians moved in the first time. But with the state breathing down their necks and Lyman at risk of falling once more, it’s not clear how candid they can be. Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous, Aamir Peerzada and Hanna Tsyba.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9xqnn3v4o,"In Russia, questions swirl over arrest of Telegram boss","Since Pavel Durov was detained in France, Russian media has been awash with speculation and conspiracies.",26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:16.697037,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Since Pavel Durov, the Russian-born billionaire and founder of the Telegram messaging app, was arrested on landing in Paris on Saturday evening, there has been more speculation than substance about his fate. The headline in a Russian newspaper summed up the story: “The arrest (or detention) of ‘Russia’s Zuckerberg’, Pavel Durov, is one of the most important, but mysterious global news stories,” declared Nezavisimaya Gazeta. True. Except that ""mysterious"" is a bit of an understatement. Why did French police detain him? What charges will he face? Has it anything at all to do with his recent visit to Azerbaijan, where he met (or didn’t meet) Russian President Vladimir Putin? For two days, reporters have quoted ""sources close to the investigation"" about the offences Pavel Durov may be charged with (allegedly, from complicity in drug-trafficking to fraud). Telegram put out a statement saying Mr Durov had ""nothing to hide"".  On Monday evening, the Paris prosecutor said in a statement that Mr Durov was being held in custody as part of a cyber-criminality investigation. The statement mentioned 12 different offences under investigation that it said were linked to organised crime. These included illicit transactions, child pornography, fraud and the refusal to disclose information to authorities, the prosecutor said. The statement added that Mr Durov's time in custody had been extended and could now last until Wednesday. Without going into detail, President Emmanuel Macron posted on social media that he had seen “false information” regarding France following Mr Durov’s arrest, and added: ""This is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to decide."" In Moscow, the Kremlin is being cautious. “We still don’t know what exactly Durov has been accused of,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Monday, in his first comments on Pavel Durov’s detention. “We haven’t heard any official statements. Before I can say anything at all about this, we need some clarity.” Clarity is not something of which everyone in Russia feels the need. On Monday, state TV’s flagship political talk show had plenty to say on the matter. “All these accusations against Durov sound absurd,” one political analyst in the studio declared. “Accusing him of all the crimes that are committed on his platform is like accusing [France's] President Macron of all the crimes that happen in France. It’s the same logic.” Russian newspapers, too, went big on the story. Several dailies expressed concern that Pavel Durov’s arrest could have serious consequences for Russia. “This blow to Telegram threatens to be a blow to Russia,” wrote Nezavisimaya Gazeta. “With Pavel Durov’s arrest, Western intelligence services could obtain the messenger’s encryption keys.” “Telegram might become a tool of Nato, if Pavel Durov is forced to obey the French intelligence services,” declared Moskovsky Komsomolets, adding: “Telegram chats contain a huge amount of vitally important, strategic information.” In April 2018, the Russian authorities began blocking access to Telegram, only to lift the ban in 2020. Today, not only do Russian officials use the messenger, but so does the Russian military, including soldiers fighting in the so-called ""Special Military Operation"" (Russia’s war in Ukraine). “If Telegram crashes,” Moskovsky Komsomolets asked today, “how is [our army] going to fight?” In the West, Pavel Durov’s detention has sparked a debate about free speech.  In Russia, too, presidential human rights ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova claimed that “the real reason for arresting Pavel Durov was to shut down Telegram, a platform where you can discover the truth about what’s happening in the world. Everyone who strives for free speech protests this.” Ms Moskalkova made no mention of the Signal messaging app, to which the Russian authorities blocked access earlier this month, or YouTube, access to which has been severely limited now in Russia. Facebook and Instagram have already been blocked here. And what of those rumours of a Putin-Durov meeting in Baku earlier in August. Was there one? “No,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov replied when I asked. However this mysterious story ends, Moscow will use it to strengthen one of its official narratives: that Russian citizens should beware of the West. As the popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda put it: “For the West, there is no such thing any more as ‘good Russians’."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qgyenzwzyo,Russian priests bless fire trucks as huge blaze continues after Ukraine attack,More than 500 firefighters have been tackling the giant blaze at a fuel depot sparked by a Ukrainian attack.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:16.803062,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russian Orthodox priests have visited the scene of a huge fire at a fuel depot, which continues to burn three days after being set alight in a Ukrainian drone attack. More than 500 firefighters have been tackling the giant blaze at the Proletarsk oil storage facility in the southern Rostov region. About 20 of 74 storage tanks were on fire, local authorities told the RIA news agency. On Wednesday, local Orthodox priests said prayers next to the fire engines and brought an icon to the scene in support of firefighters' efforts. ""The [priests] spoke with the firefighters and blessed all the fire equipment,"" the local Volgodonsk eparchy - the Russian Orthodox Church equivalent of a diocese - told Reuters news agency. They brought with them a large icon of the Unburnt Bush, considered a talisman against fire. According to regional governor Vasily Golubev, air defences shot down the Ukrainian drone on 18 August, but its debris caused diesel fuel to ignite on the territory of the facility. The authorities have declared a state of emergency, but the local city administration, quoted by Russian state media, said there was no threat of the fire spreading to residential areas and called on people ""not to give in to panic"". Mr Golubev said 41 firefighters had received medical treatment for the effects of the blaze, including five who had been placed in emergency care. Ukraine has not commented on the strike - but its forces have been targeting Russia's oil infrastructure as part of their efforts to counter Moscow's full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022. Also on Wednesday, Ukrainian forces reported striking an S-300 air defence system near the Russian city of Novoshakhtinsk in Rostov region. The strike was carried out by the Ukrainian Navy in co-operation with other units, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Facebook. ""Ukraine's defence forces continue to weaken Russian invaders' air defence,"" it said. ""It is worth noting that Russian invaders also use S-300 systems for strikes on peaceful Ukrainian cities, destroying residential buildings and terrorising civilian population,"" it added. Elsewhere on Russian soil, Moscow said its air defences had shot down 11 Ukrainian drones targeting the city overnight. The city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said it was one of the biggest attacks on the Russian capital since the conflict started, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.   At the same time, Ukrainian defences reported stopping 50 Russian drones and missiles. ""The enemy continues to attack our region with strike drones. The air raid lasted all night and into the morning for more than nine hours,"" Kyiv's military administration said on Telegram. A private house was damaged by falling debris, while power lines were severed, it added. On the ground, Ukraine is continuing to hold a swathe of territory in Russia's western Kursk region, following its cross-border incursion that began on 6 August. It is the first time that Russian territory has been occupied by a foreign power since World War Two. In his video address late on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said ""our combat work continues"" in the Kursk region. ""We control the designated areas,"" he said without providing any details. In Russia's adjacent Bryansk region, Governor Aleksandr Bogomaz said an incursion attempt by a Ukrainian reconnaissance group was repelled on Wednesday. This comes as Russian forces are continuing to press hard towards the city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine's officials said earlier this week the Russians were now about 10km (six miles) from the outskirts of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the area."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy49xlx54vo,Four takeaways from Kamala Harris's convention speech,The vice-president hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but her vision for the future lacked detail.,23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:16.897067,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, delivering a speech which hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but had only rare moments of soaring rhetoric and broke little new ground. The ground-breaking was in the nature of the nominee herself - the first woman of colour to become a major party's presidential nominee. “Never let anyone tell you who you are,” Ms Harris said. “You show them who you are.” But for roughly 45 minutes on Thursday, she tried to tell Americans who she is - and what she would do if she wins the White House.  Here are four takeaways from her convention-closing remarks.  Many Americans know who Ms Harris is, but not many know what she believes in or details of her background. First and foremost, her convention speech set out to change that. She recounted her mother’s journey as an immigrant from India. She spoke about how her parents met – and how they ultimately divorced. She talked about her childhood upbringing in a working-class neighbourhood in Oakland, California. “The middle class is where I come from,” she said. “My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us.” Ms Harris also spoke of why she chose to become a lawyer – and a prosecutor. She drew a line from her early days in the courtroom to her public services as a politician. “My entire career, I have only had one client,” she said. “The people.” Ms Harris’s speech included calls for unity and a pathway beyond the “bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles” of modern American politics. She said that the US had a “precious, fleeting” opportunity to “chart a new path forward”. But that chart had few details. Vague calls for unity and a path beyond partisanship are rhetoric many presidential hopefuls have used in the past.  When Ms Harris did turn to policy details, she spoke in generalities.  She said she will be focused on lowering the costs of “everyday needs” – including healthcare, housing and groceries. She specifically called out abortion rights – and framed it as a means of preserving freedom, which has been a recurring theme at this Democratic convention. “America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially about matters of heart and home,” she said. Ms Harris, in her speech, styled herself as a centre-left moderate, putting little daylight between her policies and those of her boss, the man she hopes to replace, Joe Biden. “Everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation ready to move forward,” she said. “Ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America.” The exact details of that step, however, are to be determined. As pro-Palestinian protesters marched outside the convention, Ms Harris devoted particular attention in the foreign-policy section of her speech to the Gaza war. Here, yet again, there was little difference between her rhetoric and views and those of Mr Biden – and she linked herself to the president several times. “President Biden and I are working around the clock,” she said, “because now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire done.” She also pledged to ensure that Israel always has the ability to defend itself and took particular note of the brutality of the 7 October Hamas attack. For a moment, it sounded like some in the crowd would jeer, but Ms Harris quickly moved on to the plight of Palestinians, saying that the scale of their suffering was “heartbreaking”. That will hardly be enough to satisfy the protesters outside, however, and they could return to their homes – some in key battleground states like Michigan – convinced that a Harris presidency would be a continuation of the Biden Gaza War policies. Two days ago, Michelle and Barack Obama formed a tag-team that belittled former president Donald Trump for what they charaterised as his small obsessions and petty personality. Ms Harris also took swipes at her Republican opponent, but they were pretty standard fare for Democrats – including Mr Biden - over the past few months. “In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man,” she said. “But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.” She brought up the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, and mentioned his criminal convictions. She also hit what has become a favourite Democratic punching bag, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a Republican presidency. Although the former president has disavowed the plan, she noted that it was written by his advisers and it sought to “pull our country back into the past”. The future vs the past contrast has been a central theme of the Harris campaign so far, as it was in her nomination acceptance speech.  It’s one of the ways the vice-president has been able to draw a distinction not only from her current Republican opponent, but from the unpopular aspects of her boss, Joe Biden, who just a few weeks ago was the presumptive Democratic nominee.

Mike Vorobets fitted out his van as a travelling salon and gives free cuts to those in need, as well as visiting areas of Scarborough where people might struggle to get to a barber's. He has become popular with his customers for supporting them with their mental health challenges. Mr Vorobets said: ""Lots of people around the world have helped Ukrainians and I think if I can help with good haircuts, I feel very good.""  Back in Ukraine, Mr Vorobets ran a successful barbering business but was forced to move, along with his four children, to Scarborough when war broke out.  He wanted to use his skills to start a new life for himself and help his community, so kitted the van out with a TV and games console to entertain children. ""I know kids often don't like the barbers with the seats and the noise so I thought I want to make something special where they can sit and play, meaning the children are happy, parents are happy and I'm happy,"" he said.  As well as his usual rounds, Mr Vorobets regularly calls at The Rainbow Centre in Scarborough, which works with vulnerable people, including those with additional needs. ""If I can help these people who have complicated lives, by cutting the price and making their lives easier with a new style, it feels nice.  ""Money is not everything in this life and when you help people, you feel like you can do everything in this world, the feeling is amazing,"" he added.  Regular customer John Edward said he enjoyed having a ""good chat"" with the barber when he was feeling lonely. ""I suffer from anxiety and don't get out much to integrate with people, but it's nice when Mike comes to see me,"" he said.  ""It's hard for some people to go to a barber shop in town - people with disabilities and children and with anxiety issues like me but this is an incredible idea where he can come to the home."" Mr Vorobets said he hoped to open a training school for barbers by the end of the year and set up 10 more mobile salons in other areas of Yorkshire. ""I like being able to make people change in front of my eyes, making them stronger, more beautiful and happier,"" he said.

The call was also the first between Mr Xi and a British prime minister since he spoke to Boris Johnson in  March 2022.   The two leaders discussed potential areas of co-operation, including on trade, the economy and education, a No 10 spokesperson said.  ""As permanent members of the UN Security Council, the leaders agreed on the importance of close working in areas, such as climate change and global security,"" they added.   ""The leaders also agreed on the need for a stable and consistent UK-China relationship, including dialogue between their respective foreign and domestic ministers."" China's embassy in the UK said President Xi congratulated Sir Keir on taking office, and said the two countries needed to ""view their relations from a long-term and strategic perspective"". In a statement, it added: ""China is committed to building a great country and achieving national rejuvenation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernisation, and follows a path of peaceful development. ""It is hoped that the UK will view China in an objective and rational manner."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy met Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathering in Laos last month. He urged China to stop its companies supporting Russia's war effort, and stressed the UK's ""ironclad"" commitment to backing Ukraine.  Sir Keir's conversation with Mr Xi comes amid a period of strained relations between London and Beijing over espionage allegations and China's tightening control over former UK colony Hong Kong. However, the two countries remain major trading partners as well as permanent members of the UN Security Council. China was Britain's fifth largest trading partner in 2023, according to UK statistics, but diplomatic relations were icy under former PM Rishi Sunak. Soon after taking office in October 2022, Mr Sunak declared an end to the so-called ""golden era"" of UK-China relations trumpeted by former Prime Minister David Cameron. He also described China as a ""systemic challenge"" to UK values. In 2021, China imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens, including five Conservative MPs. In 2023, the UK Parliament banned TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app, from being accessed on its wi-fi over security concerns. TikTok has denied claims it passes on users' data to the Chinese government.  In April, UK police charged two men under the Official Secrets Act with spying for China."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgxqx1j9y2o,Actor Jeremy Irons secures home for refugees,"The 75-year-old actor renovated the ""eyesore"" cottage and is now helping secure it for refugees.",23 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:17.202120,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Actor Jeremy Irons has helped to ensure a cottage in Watlington can be let out to Ukrainian refugees. The BBC understands he has agreed to enter into a tenancy on the property so it can continue to be used to house families in need.  The cottage and neighbouring library were left to Oxfordshire County Council (OCC) for the benefit of the people of Watlington. Mr Irons, 75, helped renovate it last year to allow a Ukrainian family to move in, and has now helped to ""get round"" council concerns about entering into an official agreement. The property was bequeathed to the council by Charlotte Coxe in 1949. A Ukrainian family has already spent more than a year in the cottage, after fleeing war in their home country. But OCC was ""cautious"" about entering into an official agreement with them because of the risk of creating a ""secure tenancy"", which gives tenants the right to stay in a property for the rest of their lives. The Charlotte Coxe Trust Committee, part of OCC, has now agreed to enter into a year-long tenancy with a ""named local sponsor"", understood to be The Lion King and Man in the Iron Mask star Jeremy Irons. The cottage will then be sublet to Ukrainian refugees. County council solicitor Richard Hodby said it was a ""positive story"". ""Until about two years ago, 33 High Street had sat empty, unoccupied and a bit of an eyesore in Watlington's otherwise very attractive high street,"" he said. ""Thanks to the generosity of the sponsor and also to the local efforts... it has been transformed into a fully-occupiable property. And it's enabled a refugee family from Ukraine to spend... slightly in excess of 12 months there."" He said the agreement made on Thursday meant that they could ""get round"" tenancy issues. ""Our sponsor has very kindly agreed to take the tenancy in his own name, and it will have a condition in it that he can't occupy the property and then that will hopefully get round the issue of creating a secure tenancy. ""We also know our sponsor is a very well-known celebrity figure with substantial assets, and I think he would not be particularly interested in any event of taking a secure tenancy of a small little house in Watlington.  ""So we think the risk of creating a secure tenancy is almost non-existent."" The meeting was told that the Ukrainian family originally occupying the cottage has moved out, but it is hoped other refugees will move in from September.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w6zld90zjo,"'Windiest part of the UK' could power nearly 500,000 homes","The islands are the windiest part of the UK, which means it will be rare for the turbines not to be spinning.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:17.296710,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Power is flowing from the Shetland Isles to mainland Britain for the first time as the UK's most productive onshore windfarm comes on stream. SSE says its 103-turbine project, known as Viking, can generate 443 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes. Shetland is the windiest part of the UK, which means it will be rare for the blades, which reach a massive 155m at their tip, not to be spinning. Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies told BBC News a ""significant acceleration"" in renewable energy infrastructure is now urgently needed if the UK is to meet its climate change targets. ""We need to do a lot more of these projects, a lot more offshore wind projects as well, to make sure that we can decarbonise the energy system,"" he said. But critics of windfarms – and the pylons required to carry the electricity they generate – say a new era of mass industrialisation for private profit will ruin swathes of the British countryside. SSE has built a 160-mile long undersea cable to carry the power from Viking to Noss Head, near Wick, on the Scottish mainland. The company said it has invested more than £1bn in the windfarm and cable projects, and plans to plough another £20bn into renewables by the end of the decade. Mr Phillips-Davies said that would amount to ""the biggest construction that we've seen since the Second World War."" ""Shetland's got a great wind resource. This is the first of the really big wind farms that may be built here. There'll be more projects to come,"" he said. The UK's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Viking was ""a crucial part"" of reducing the UK's reliance on ""volatile fossil fuel markets, boosting our energy independence and protecting consumers."" The Labour government has set a target for 100% of the UK's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030, phasing out gas-fired power stations. Ministers have promised to accelerate the development of wind, hydrogen and carbon capture projects by investing £8.3bn over five years in a publicly-owned power company called Great British Energy. The Conservatives have previously said that GB Energy is a ""financial black hole"" which will funnel taxpayers' money ""into reducing risk for multi-million pound energy companies."" Mr Miliband also claims the Viking project will ensure ""hundreds of thousands of homes in the Shetlands and right across the country will benefit from cheap, homegrown energy,"" but that is hotly contested on the archipelago. Moraig Lyall, chair of the environment and transport committee of Shetland Islands Council, said annual household bills in the islands were often more than double the UK average of £1,700 and showed no sign of falling as a result of hosting Viking. ""People look out their windows now, they see all these turbines that are generating lots and lots of energy, but they're not seeing the benefit here,"" she said. ""They're still sitting in their homes having to decide, can I afford to put on my heating, and so people are justifiably angry about that."" She added that islanders were also worried about Viking's impact on the landscape; the peat bog environment on which it was built; and tourism. Like most renewable projects it will generate a ""community benefit fund"" but islanders say the gains will be small - about £72m over 25 years - in comparison to the revenue from the windfarm. There has also been anger on the island that the windfarm operator has received more than £2m already in ""constraint payments"" which pay for it not to generate power. These payments are made during times when the amount of energy being generated exceeds the capacity of the network to transfer it where it is needed – mainly England. The process of transferring the power is also causing concern on the mainland too. Some communities are objecting to plans by SSE and others to erect large pylons to transmit electricity from new renewable projects to cities and towns throughout Scotland, England and Wales. ""Somebody needs to police the line between net zero ideology and rampant commercial opportunism,"" said Kate Matthews of Save Our Mearns, a group campaigning against SSE's plans to install 66 miles (106km) of new pylons from Kintore in Aberdeenshire to Tealing in Angus. ""Angus and Aberdeenshire are looking at 10 to 20 years of industrialisation, so constant building, constant applications, thousands of acres of battery energy storage, thousands of acres of solar turbine hydrogen plants,"" said Ms Matthews. ""We'll be paying the price for generations. It will be unrecognisable,"" she added. Ms Matthews said ""the rest of the UK doesn't know what's coming,"" with plans for new pylons in Essex, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, the Lake District, parts of Wales, and elsewhere. Ministers have also pledged to reform planning laws to make it easier and quicker for big projects to gain consent. Mr Phillips-Davies of SSE said that was vital, pointing out that it took 20 years for Viking to go from inception to blades turning, 16 years of which were on paper. He is calling for both the UK and Scottish governments to streamline and accelerate their planning processes so projects can be approved or rejected within 12 months. He points out that Berwick Bank in the outer Firth of Forth, which would be the world's largest offshore windfarm, has been waiting for consent from the Scottish government for nearly two years. It's not just renewable energy companies which have worries about the pace of the transition from fossil fuels to greener sources of power. In Aberdeen, the home of the UK oil and gas industry, there are concerns that the UK government is putting jobs at risk. “This is already a sector which is paying three times the tax of the wider economy,” says David Whitehouse of the industry body, Offshore Energies UK, formerly Oil & Gas UK. Producers currently pay a tax rate of 78%, including a windfall tax brought in after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a spike in the oil price. Mr Whitehouse says he is also concerned about the removal of tax breaks for investment. He warns of a potential ""shutdown of investment"" which he says could have consequences for thousands of jobs and implications for ""the very supply chain that we need to deliver a successful domestic home-grown energy transition"". ""We're starting to see resources, key equipment, drilling rigs and personnel leave the basin,"" agrees Steve Bowyer, North Sea general manager of oil and gas producer, EnQuest. ""We actually want to grow in the UK but we need the right fiscal conditions to drive that growth,” he adds. Mr Bowyer says his firm will be ""watching very closely"" what Chancellor Rachel Reeves does in her autumn budget and how she engages with industry “over the next six to 12 months” as it considers where to invest in future. ""There's a risk of causing irreparable damage to the industry and the UK economy if we don't see proper engagement, collaboration and action to put in place an appropriate fiscal regime,"" he added. The government insists it will protect North Sea jobs for decades to come while also ensuring a smooth transition to renewable energy. But it is clear that ministers face pressure and scrutiny from the oil industry on one hand and the renewables sector on the other. Going green is not without its challenges."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w6zld90zjo,"'Windiest part of the UK' could power nearly 500,000 homes","The islands are the windiest part of the UK, which means it will be rare for the turbines not to be spinning.",29 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:23.132969,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Power is flowing from the Shetland Isles to mainland Britain for the first time as the UK's most productive onshore windfarm comes on stream. SSE says its 103-turbine project, known as Viking, can generate 443 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes. Shetland is the windiest part of the UK, which means it will be rare for the blades, which reach a massive 155m at their tip, not to be spinning. Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies told BBC News a ""significant acceleration"" in renewable energy infrastructure is now urgently needed if the UK is to meet its climate change targets. ""We need to do a lot more of these projects, a lot more offshore wind projects as well, to make sure that we can decarbonise the energy system,"" he said. But critics of windfarms – and the pylons required to carry the electricity they generate – say a new era of mass industrialisation for private profit will ruin swathes of the British countryside. SSE has built a 160-mile long undersea cable to carry the power from Viking to Noss Head, near Wick, on the Scottish mainland. The company said it has invested more than £1bn in the windfarm and cable projects, and plans to plough another £20bn into renewables by the end of the decade. Mr Phillips-Davies said that would amount to ""the biggest construction that we've seen since the Second World War."" ""Shetland's got a great wind resource. This is the first of the really big wind farms that may be built here. There'll be more projects to come,"" he said. The UK's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Viking was ""a crucial part"" of reducing the UK's reliance on ""volatile fossil fuel markets, boosting our energy independence and protecting consumers."" The Labour government has set a target for 100% of the UK's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030, phasing out gas-fired power stations. Ministers have promised to accelerate the development of wind, hydrogen and carbon capture projects by investing £8.3bn over five years in a publicly-owned power company called Great British Energy. The Conservatives have previously said that GB Energy is a ""financial black hole"" which will funnel taxpayers' money ""into reducing risk for multi-million pound energy companies."" Mr Miliband also claims the Viking project will ensure ""hundreds of thousands of homes in the Shetlands and right across the country will benefit from cheap, homegrown energy,"" but that is hotly contested on the archipelago. Moraig Lyall, chair of the environment and transport committee of Shetland Islands Council, said annual household bills in the islands were often more than double the UK average of £1,700 and showed no sign of falling as a result of hosting Viking. ""People look out their windows now, they see all these turbines that are generating lots and lots of energy, but they're not seeing the benefit here,"" she said. ""They're still sitting in their homes having to decide, can I afford to put on my heating, and so people are justifiably angry about that."" She added that islanders were also worried about Viking's impact on the landscape; the peat bog environment on which it was built; and tourism. Like most renewable projects it will generate a ""community benefit fund"" but islanders say the gains will be small - about £72m over 25 years - in comparison to the revenue from the windfarm. There has also been anger on the island that the windfarm operator has received more than £2m already in ""constraint payments"" which pay for it not to generate power. These payments are made during times when the amount of energy being generated exceeds the capacity of the network to transfer it where it is needed – mainly England. The process of transferring the power is also causing concern on the mainland too. Some communities are objecting to plans by SSE and others to erect large pylons to transmit electricity from new renewable projects to cities and towns throughout Scotland, England and Wales. ""Somebody needs to police the line between net zero ideology and rampant commercial opportunism,"" said Kate Matthews of Save Our Mearns, a group campaigning against SSE's plans to install 66 miles (106km) of new pylons from Kintore in Aberdeenshire to Tealing in Angus. ""Angus and Aberdeenshire are looking at 10 to 20 years of industrialisation, so constant building, constant applications, thousands of acres of battery energy storage, thousands of acres of solar turbine hydrogen plants,"" said Ms Matthews. ""We'll be paying the price for generations. It will be unrecognisable,"" she added. Ms Matthews said ""the rest of the UK doesn't know what's coming,"" with plans for new pylons in Essex, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, the Lake District, parts of Wales, and elsewhere. Ministers have also pledged to reform planning laws to make it easier and quicker for big projects to gain consent. Mr Phillips-Davies of SSE said that was vital, pointing out that it took 20 years for Viking to go from inception to blades turning, 16 years of which were on paper. He is calling for both the UK and Scottish governments to streamline and accelerate their planning processes so projects can be approved or rejected within 12 months. He points out that Berwick Bank in the outer Firth of Forth, which would be the world's largest offshore windfarm, has been waiting for consent from the Scottish government for nearly two years.

Ukrainian soldiers are two weeks into their incursion in Russia's Kursk region - their deepest since Moscow launched its full scale invasion more than two years ago.  Troops are continuing to advance further into Kursk, the force said in its daily report.  Moscow has called the incursion a major provocation and vowed to retaliate with a ""worthy response"".  In a statement on messaging app Telegram, President Zelensky said: ""Thank you to all the soldiers and commanders who are taking Russian military prisoners and bringing the release of our soldiers and civilians held by Russia closer.  ""General Syrskyi also reported on strengthening our forces' positions in the Kursk region and expanding the stabilised territory."" Russia said its forces had repelled the Ukrainians near three settlements in the Kursk region and were searching for ""mobile enemy groups"" trying to pierce deeper into the country.  Kyiv claims to have taken control of more than 80 settlements in the incursion.  His latest statement comes after Ukraine destroyed a strategically important bridge over the river Seym this week.  The bridge had been used by the Kremlin to supply its troops and its destruction could hamper those efforts.  The Russian foreign ministry said the bridge was ""completely destroyed"" and volunteers assisting the evacuated civilian population had been killed.  However, as Ukraine moves further into western Russian territory, Russian forces are equally making gains in Ukraine's east and have claimed a string of villages in recent weeks.  Russia attacked at least four Ukrainian regions on Saturday, according to Ukrainian officials, including the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. Mr Zelensky said on Saturday there had been ""dozens of Russian assaults"" on Ukrainian positions near the cities of Toretsk and Pokrovsk.  Pokrovsk is a vital logistics hub that sits on a main road for supplies to Ukrainian troops along the eastern front. ""Our soldiers and units are doing everything to destroy the occupier and repel the attacks,"" the Ukrainian president said, stressing the situation was ""under control""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2jxjd7r7o,Hungary law could make Ukrainian refugees homeless,Thousands of Ukrainian refugees could be forced on to the streets or back to Ukraine.,21 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:23.351744,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A new law has come into force in Hungary which threatens to push thousands of Ukrainian refugees on to the streets or back to Ukraine. The regulation restricts state support for Ukrainians to those who come from parts of Ukraine directly affected by the fighting caused by Russia's invasion.  Thirteen regions in Ukraine are on the list, which will be updated monthly by the Hungarian government.  It is not known how many of the 31,000 Ukrainians taking shelter in Hungary will be affected by the new law.  Human rights groups say the most vulnerable are those from the Roma ethnic minority from the westernmost Transcarpathian region, who are still living in shelters which will now close.  Their situation is complicated by the fact that many are dual Ukrainian-Hungarian citizens, who have been refused help elsewhere in the European Union on the grounds they are Hungarian citizens. The UN refugee agency said the law change will mean an estimated 2,000-3,000 refugees will ""lose access to subsidised accommodation"". ""Many face significant barriers in securing alternative housing due to lack of financial means but also reluctance of owners to rent,"" the UNHCR said. ""For many, the change will result in job losses and impact school enrolment, jeopardizing the positive integration achievements obtained so far."" Under the new law, only Ukrainians whose last official address in Ukraine was in an area ""directly affected by military operations"" remain eligible for state support, which includes free housing and a basic monthly sum.  Government decree 134 changes legislation dating back to 2022 and the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. "

Over the weekend, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine needed partners ""who can truly help to step up"".  He also repeated his call for Ukraine to be allowed to use long-range missiles, donated by Western allies, against targets inside Russia.  No 10 said the prime minister was ""resolute"" in his support for Ukraine, adding that the UK had committed £3bn a year to help its ally.  A spokeswoman said there had been ""no change"" in the UK's position on how Ukraine could use long-range missiles but added there was ""ongoing dialogue"". Downing Street's comments come almost two weeks after Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Russia's western border territories, advancing 18 miles into the Kursk region. In a message posted to social media on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said the ""bravery"" and ""resilience"" of his soldiers ""compensate for the lack of essential decisions from our partners"".  The Ukrainian president has previously urged the British government to let him use long-range Storm Shadow missiles, provided by the UK, against targets inside Russia.  On Saturday he reiterated this call saying: ""It is crucial that our partners remove barriers that hinder us from weakening Russian positions in the way this war demands. ""Long-range capabilities are the answer to the most critical strategic questions of this war."" He added that throughout the war, which started in 2022, the UK had ""demonstrated leadership"" in its support for Ukraine. However, he added: ""Unfortunately, the situation has slowed down recently. We will discuss how to fix this because long-range capabilities are vital for us."" Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the UK has been one of the country's leading donors, pledging £12.5bn, including £7.6bn for military assistance.   The UK has previously said Ukraine has a ""clear right"" to use UK-provided weapons for ""self defence"" and that ""does not preclude operations inside Russia"". The stance means anti-tank missiles, artillery and armoured vehicles can be used as part of Ukraine's offensive in Russia.  However, there is still an exception for the use of Storm Shadow missiles, which were supplied on the understanding they would not be used for targets inside Russia.  Storm Shadow missiles have a range of more than 150 miles meaning Ukrainian pilots can use them while staying away from the front line of the conflict. So far, Ukraine's other Western allies have also avoided giving Kyiv the green light to use their long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia.  Asked about Mr Zelensky's comments, No 10 said: ""The prime minister remains absolutely resolute in his support for Ukraine. ""On the latest situation, including in Kursk, the prime minister wants to set out his full admiration for the bravery shown by Ukrainian soldiers who have once again proved their spirit and determination in the face of continued Russian aggression. ""It is a reminder that Ukraine has consistently exceeded expectations of what is possible and Russia continues to fail. ""But in terms of our support, again, it is unwavering. That's why we committed to £3bn a year in support for Ukraine to do that for as long as it (the war) lasts."" Pressed on whether the government would lift restrictions on how Ukraine can use the UK-donated Storm Shadow missiles, No 10 said there had been ""no change in the UK's position on that specifically"". The spokeswoman added that the UK has ""an ongoing dialogue with our allies about a co-ordinated effort between us all to do the same thing and be united in our support for Ukraine""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79wqpqp297o,Russian forces claim another town captured in east Ukraine,"Ukraine does not confirm the loss of Niu-York, saying Russian forces are attacking near the town.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:23.572950,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia's military says it has captured a small town in eastern Ukraine called Niu-York, as part of its push towards big population centres in the Donetsk region.  Ukraine's military has not confirmed the loss of Niu-York, saying only that Russian forces are attacking close to the town and other areas. The army was giving the attacks ""a worthy rebuff... and the fighting continues"", it said. Although only a small settlement, controlling Niu-York would represent another step towards the two Donetsk hubs of Toretsk and Pokrovsk. One of the aims of Ukraine's seizure of territory in Russia's Kursk region is thought to be to force Russia to move some of its forces away from the eastern campaign.  There is no indication so far of that happening, despite Ukraine's commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi now claiming control of 93 Russian villages and towns. President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation in the east as difficult, but said Ukrainian troops were doing all they could to destroy the Russian forces. The military chief told a briefing that Russia was sending additional troops to the front line in the east. A Russia defence ministry statement said active operations by units of its Centre forces group had defeated Ukrainian troops, referring to Niu-York as ""one of the largest settlements of the Toretsk agglomeration and a strategically important logistics hub"". It also called the town by the Russian name of Novgorodskoye. Russian military bloggers shared footage late on Monday of a Russian tricolor flag being posted on the roof of a school in Niu-York with the Ukrainian flag lying on the ground.  However, the video first circulated two weeks ago and Ukrainian forces had since blown up the flag and damaged the roof with a drone on 8 August. Niu-York is just south of the mining town of Toretsk, and Russian forces on Monday said they had also captured Zalizne, to the south-east of Toretsk. Ukrainian forces said they were still fighting back in Zalizne and local sources were quoted as saying they still had control of 20% of Niu-York too, although they had far fewer reserves than the Russians. On Monday, Ukrainian authorities ordered the evacuation of Pokrovsk, as Russian forces continue to advance on the town. According to a military briefing on Tuesday, Russia had directed more than a third of its 87 attacks during the day on it push towards Pokrovsk. Local officials say Russia's military is now about 10km (6 miles) from the outskirts of the town. Regional head Vadym Filashkin has said 53,000 people still live in Pokrovsk, including almost 4,000 children. Ukraine's commander in chief said the counter-offensive in Russia's Kursk region had now advanced 28-35km beyond the border, with 1,263 sq km under Ukrainian control and a total of 93 population centres. Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said three new military groupings had been formed to counter the Ukrainian operation in three border regions, Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk. Their task would be to protect ""citizens and territories from attacks"" from drones and other and other assault means. Russian officials have played down the success of the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region.  Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, commander of Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces unit, told Russian TV that Ukraine's military had sustained very serious losses. Asked to respond to reports that three bridges had been blown up over the River Seym, cutting off evacuation and supply routes, he said ""the fact that some bridge has been blown up doesn’t mean anything"". However, state news agency Tass says local police are now having to use privately owned boats to get civilians to safety because bridges are down. German photographer Nanna Heitmann said she had spoken to Russians in the region who were furious that state media were not giving the full picture: ""They're shocked, they are angry. A lot of people wait, thousands of people waiting in lines to find shelter, to find basic needs like blankets, pillows etc."" Russia's Vladimir Putin, who has appeared wrong-footed by the Ukrainian offensive, compared it on Tuesday to a 2004 school massacre by Chechen militants in Beslan where more than 300 people were killed. On a visit to the school and to mothers of the victims in North Ossetia, he said ""just as we fought with terrorists previously, now we fight with those who commit crimes in Kursk region, Donbas and Novorossiya"", using an old Russian imperial term for areas of occupied Ukraine.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg3nk8kjno,Help with energy bills urged for struggling pensioners,The Citizens' Advice warning comes as energy firms meet the government for talks on help with bills.,28 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:23.653182,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Pensioners with the highest needs and lowest incomes should receive better targeted support with energy bills, says Citizens' Advice. From next month, those not on pension credit or other means-tested benefits will no longer get the annual winter fuel payments, worth between £100 and £300. But Citizens' Advice boss Dame Clare Moriarty, who attended a government meeting with energy firms to discuss the issue on Wednesday, called for a ""social tariff"" - discounted bills for those least able to afford them. The prime minister has defended the decision to scrap universal winter fuel payments, saying it was needed to repair what he claims is a £22bn ""hole"" in the public finances. In a speech on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer said he had to be honest that ""things [would] get worse before they [got] better"" when it came to public spending. The meeting to discuss how to help those struggling with energy bills was called last week by Energy Consumers Minister Miatta Fahnbulleh after it was announced the energy price cap would rise from October. Regulator Ofgem has said gas and electricity prices will rise by 10% in England, Scotland and Wales under the new energy price cap, with the typical annual dual-fuel bill paid by direct debit to be £1,717 per year. Ofgem, trade association Energy UK and Citizens Advice all attended the meeting.  Following the meeting, Ms Fahnbulleh said the determination from all those present to protect vulnerable families was clear.  ""We are committed to putting in place winter support this October. We will be hashing out the details over the next month so that families that need it are protected in the colder months.” Energy UK chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told the BBC that the ""red lights [were] flashing on the dashboard"". ""It was crystal clear that we all agree there was a real problem for this winter. ""We definitely need intervention. We have to do our bit as industry but we know it’s got to be a partnership with government."" She added that the meeting had been ""really positive"" with some ""good ideas in the room"". Both Octopus Energy and Good Energy called for long-term investment in renewables to help bring bills down. Good Energy also repeated its call for the government to implement a social tariff.  Earlier, Dame Clare said: ""Winter fuel payment will still be paid to people receiving pension credit, and that’s actually one of the most underclaimed benefits there is, so 1.4 million people receive pension credit and there’s nearly another 900,000 people who could. ""It’s really important to see better support so that people do access it."" However, there are concerns the government's decision to stop the payments for everyone could create a public health emergency.  Speaking to the BBC, Dame Clare said pensioners who are least able to afford gas and electricity should be put on to a social tariff offering discounted bills. And she said energy suppliers ""need to step up to their responsibilities on energy efficiency and on payment plans for those who are struggling"". Roger Gardner, 73, is classed as extremely clinically vulnerable. He told the BBC that means he has to stay warm in the winter. He and his wife have lost their winter fuel payments, a change they didn't anticipate.  ""It's not as though we've got extra money coming in. Unfortunately when you're a pensioner, money is limited and what you've got coming in, that is it and you've got to plan how you spend it really wisely."" He said they don't eat much anyway so they can't cut down on food. ""Turning [down] the thermostat unfortunately doesn't work because I've got to keep warm all the time in the winter. We're hoping that we don't have a cold winter."" The charity Age UK says it believes ""as many as two million pensioners who find paying their energy bills a real stretch will be seriously hit by this cut"" and have launched a petition calling for a government U-turn.  The Conservatives have also urged Labour to back down on the decision and are seeking to challenge the policy change in the House of Commons.  The decision was announced in July by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and applies to pensioners in England and Wales. Subsequently the Scottish government has said it will follow suit and scrap universal fuel payments. Since the announcement both Ms Reeves and Sir Keir have defended the move.  On Tuesday, the prime minister said he ""didn't want to means-test the winter fuel payment but it was a choice we had to take"". Speaking on Wednesday, the chancellor said it was necessary ""given the inheritance that we faced from the Conservative government"". However, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has previously said ""half of [the] spending 'hole' is public pay over which government made a choice and where pressures were known"". For example, £9bn of that came from government agreeing higher pay awards to the public sector.  Wednesday's meeting followed the publication of a new report that has found that the reduction of people in fuel poverty has ""flatlined"" in the past few years. ""There has been a stalling of progress,"" said Caroline Flint, chair of the Committee on Fuel Poverty, which advises the government. Ms Flint said that while the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic had ""obscured the lack of material progress"" being made in fuel poverty reduction, the committee had hoped more progress would have been made on its 2023 recommendations. These included improving the affordability of bills through fairer pricing and creating a ""robust"" fuel poverty strategy.  She said eligibility for the Warm Home Discount - a one-off £150 discount applied to electricity bills by suppliers - needed to be widened.  She called for a ""winter plan"" to help struggling households, including the one in four households in private rented accommodation. Ms Flint added that without a change in government policy, a drop in fuel poverty levels was unlikely in the near future. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr40wwzd4gyo,Ukraine orders evacuation of city as Russia gains,Officials said families with children living in Pokrovsk and surrounding villages would be forced to leave.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:23.916529,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukrainian authorities have ordered the evacuation of a key city in the Donbas region as Russian forces continue to make gains in the east of the country, despite Ukraine's ongoing offensive into Russia's Kursk region.  Officials said families with children living in Pokrovsk and surrounding villages would be forced to leave.  The head of the city's military government, Serhii Dobriak, said residents had at most two weeks to flee the Russian advance.  The strategically important city is one of Ukraine's main defensive strongholds and a key logistical hub for Kyiv's troops on the eastern front.  Donetsk region head Vadym Filashkin said over 53,000 people, including almost 4,000 children, remained in the city.  He said authorities had taken the decision to forcibly evacuate children and their parents or guardians. ""When our cities are within range of virtually any enemy weapon, the decision to evacuate is necessary and inevitable."" Mr Dobriak said the rate of evacuations from the city had risen to about 500 to 600 people a day. He said that while basic services continued to operate, they would likely soon cease to function as the Russian army closes in.  The evacuation order came even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his forces were continuing to make gains during their incursion of Russia's Kursk region.  On Monday, President Zelensky said Ukraine had gained control of over 1,250 sq km of Kursk’s territory and 92 settlements. ""The Russian border area opposite our Sumy region has been mostly cleared of Russian military presence,"" he said on X.  ""A few months ago, many people around the world would have said this was impossible and crossed Russia’s strictest 'red line',"" he added. One of the aims of the incursion is reportedly to divert Russia's troops away from the Donbas region, relieving pressure on beleaguered Ukrainian troops there.  On Monday, Russian military bloggers claimed Ukraine had blown up a third bridge over the River Seym in the Kursk region. Kyiv did not claim responsibility but the destruction of the bridge would likely further hinder Russian military logistics and help Ukraine consolidate its control over the territory it has seized from Moscow.  But BBC Verify has identified new pontoon bridges - temporary, floating crossings, quickly constructed and used in the absence of permanent structures - over the river, apparently constructed by Russian forces. In these satellite images taken on Saturday, the two recently built crossings, near Glushkovo, can be seen. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank said that while Russia appeared committed to a strategy of ""gradual creeping advances"" in the east, Ukraine's surprise advance into Kursk showed that seizing the initiative had allowed Kyiv to make significant gains rather than slowly losing a ""war of attrition"". The ISW said it had assessed Ukraine to be present across 800 sq km of Russian territory, though it added that presence did not necessarily equate to control. By contrast, the think tank estimates that Russia gained about 1,175 sq km between January and July. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7l6kzppyxo,Fish and chips price rise tops UK takeaways,"The deep fried delicacy has seen the biggest price increase of some of the UK’s most popular takeaways, according to new figures.",26 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:24.002300,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Fish and chips is a British family favourite equally enjoyed around the table on a Friday night or out of the paper on an often overcast beach. But the deep fried delicacy has seen the biggest price increase of some of the UK’s most popular takeaways, according to new figures. The average price for a portion of fish and chips rose more than 50% to nearly £10 in the five years to July – while the cost of a kebab went up 44% and pizza 30%. Chip shop owners cite a ""perfect storm"" of costs in recent years, including soaring energy bills, tariffs on seafood imports and extreme weather hammering potato harvests. This all means a family of four won't get much change out of a £50 note once they've forked out for their tea and added some mushy peas and cans of pop. ""I’ve never known an onslaught of pressures in terms of costs going up,"" said Jon Long, of Long John’s Fish and Chips in Dorset. Jon is the third generation of his family in the trade and his daughter Emma has recently taken the helm of the business. He added: ""I’d like to think we’ll see a fifth generation but I’m not sure."" Fish and chips has been a staple on the menus of British families for decades, so much so that supplies of the two ingredients were protected during both world wars. But according to Jon, a combination of increased energy and labour costs, sanctions on Russian seafood due to the invasion of Ukraine, and poor potato harvests, have forced fish and chip shops to raise their prices. The average price of takeaway fish and chips was £9.88 in July this year, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That was up by 52% compared with £6.48 in July 2019. While the ONS says the figures are estimates, it suggests the cost of a fish supper has gone up more in percentage terms than that for pizza, or an Indian or Chinese main course. ""We’ve had the perfect storm of events in terms of cost pressures,"" said Jon. ""It’s not a cheap meal anymore. I think it’s still good value but it has become more expensive."" In March 2022, the UK government announced a 35% tariff on Russian seafood imports in response to the invasion of Ukraine, at a time when food prices across the UK were rising at the fastest rate in more than a decade. More recently, extreme weather conditions have hit potato harvests. Cedric Porter, a potato market expert, said the rise in spud prices had been ""dramatic"". He added: ""We’ve seen very high potato prices because of a small crop last year, and there's been a small crop across the whole of Europe."" Prices paid to UK farmers for potatoes have shot up over the last two years, according to the latest figures from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs' Agricultural Price Index (API). Angela Cartwright, owner of Kingfisher Fish Bar in Salford, previously told BBC Breakfast that potato prices were ""extortionate"". She said: ""People think that fish and chips is a cheap meal and it just isn’t. People are prepared to pay £15-20 for a pizza but they’re not prepared to pay it for a portion of fish and chips."" Jon said the current economic climate was the ""toughest set of conditions"" he had faced in his 30-plus years in the business. ""More and more pubs, hotels, chip shops, bakers and other businesses are shutting down due to crippling costs,"" he said. For Jon, the main challenge remains his energy costs, especially standing charges, which are a daily fixed fee paid to energy suppliers for being connected to the system, regardless of how much gas or electricity a business uses. He said the amount these charges had increased since 2021 was ""outrageous"", adding that the energy regulator Ofgem had failed to protect small businesses from the increases. A spokesperson for Ofgem said it had introduced new rules to ensure businesses get fairer treatment, more support resolving disputes, and greater transparency on fees charged by energy brokers. They added: ""We know high energy bills continue to be a challenge for many businesses. We are working closely with government and industry to understand the range of issues non-domestic customers face, and where the powers we have to tackle them could be stronger."" The government said it was right to impose tariffs on imports of Russian fish, as well as other exports from the country. A statement said local takeaways were ""essential to thriving, vibrant communities"" and support would be developed which included reforming business rates."

Russian officials have been quoted as saying the operation near the town of Glushkovo has cut off part of the local district.  The bridge was used by the Kremlin to supply its troops and its destruction could hamper their efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops were strengthening their positions in Kursk, and called the captured territories an exchange fund, implying they could be swapped for Ukrainian regions occupied by Moscow.  Now in its second week, this is Ukraine's deepest incursion into Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion more than two years ago. Ukraine’s surprise cross-border operation has resulted in more than 120,000 people fleeing to safety.  But amid Ukrainian claims of territorial gains, Kyiv has repeatedly maintained it does not wish to occupy Russia. ""Ukraine is not interested in occupying Russian territories,"" a senior aide to Ukrainian President Zelensky said on Friday. Mykhailo Podolyak said one of the key objectives they wanted out of their incursion into Russia was to get Moscow to negotiate  ""on our own terms"". ""In the Kursk region, we can clearly see how the military tool is being used objectively to persuade Russia to enter a fair negotiation process,"" he wrote on X, adding Kyiv has proven “effective means of coercion”. The head of the Ukrainian military, Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Friday that the offensive had made further progress. ""The troops of the offensive group continue to fight and have advanced in some areas from one to three kilometres towards the enemy,"" he told President Zelensky in a video posted on social media. Syrsky said he hoped to take ""many prisoners"" from a battle in the village of Mala Loknya, about 13km (8 miles) from the border. As Ukraine's advance continues, officials in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine have said they will evacuate five villages starting on Monday. ""From 19 August, we are closing access to five settlements, removing residents and helping them bring out their property,"" Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on the Telegram social messaging app, naming small villages near the border. However, as Ukraine moves further into western Russian territory, Russian forces are equally making gains in Ukraine’s east. On Friday, Moscow said its troops had captured Serhiivka, the latest in a string of towns claimed by Russian troops in recent weeks. The latest advances bring the Russians closer to the city of Pokrovsk, a vital logistics hub that sits on a main road for supplies to Ukrainian troops along the eastern front. Pokrovsk lies north-west of the Russian-held Donetsk region, which has been under Ukrainian fire since Friday morning, leaving several civilians injured. A message from the head of the city’s military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, on Thursday, urged people to evacuate as Russia was “rapidly approaching the outskirts"". Earlier, Russian-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine's Donetsk region blamed Kyiv for a strike on a shopping centre that wounded at least seven. According to the Russia-backed governor of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic,  Denis Pushilin, the city has been under shelling since midday on Friday. Reuters news agency reported that over the past 24 hours, three civilians had been killed and five others injured, citing Donetsk’s regional head. In Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, missiles targeting a bridge built under Russian President Vladimir Putin’s orders were shot down overnight, the defence ministry said on Telegram. Kyiv has launched multiple attacks and attempted attacks on the Kerch Bridge since Moscow began its military offensive."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y36rdreq1o,Ukraine says it has destroyed second Russian bridge,"Ukrainian forces continue their incursion into Russia's Kursk region, claiming destruction of a second bridge.",19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:31.060677,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine says it has destroyed a second strategic bridge in a week as it continues its incursion into Russia's Kursk region.  The Ukrainian military on Sunday released aerial footage of the strike on the bridge - reported to be over the Seym River in Zvannoe. Hours later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said for the first time that the aims of the military incursion into Kursk included the creation of a ""buffer zone"" to stop Russian attacks. Ukraine is nearly two weeks into its biggest attack on Russian territory since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  ""Minus one more bridge,"" Ukrainian Air Force commander Lt Gen Mykola Oleschuk posted on social media with footage of the strike.  Gen Oleschuk added: ""Ukrainian Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision airstrikes, which significantly affects the course of hostilities."" The video shows a growing large cloud of smoke over the bridge and one of its sections appears to be destroyed. It is not clear when the strike took place.  Earlier this week, Ukraine destroyed another bridge over the river Seym, near the town of Glushkovo.  That bridge was used by the Kremlin to supply its troops.  Earlier, military analysts had identified three bridges in the area used by Russia to supply its forces, and they said two had either been destroyed or seriously damaged, Reuters news agency reported. Almost two weeks after Ukrainian troops pushed across the border into Russia, it is becoming clear that they plan to stay. President Zelensky said on Saturday his troops were strengthening positions in Kursk and expanding further in Russia. On Sunday in an evening address, he said: ""Our operation in the Kursk region is still inflicting losses on the Russian army and the Russian state, their defence industry and their economy."" He stated that ""this is more than just defence for Ukraine"" and said that the aim was to ""destroy as much Russian war potential as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions"".  This would include ""creating a buffer zone on the aggressor’s territory"", he added, in an effort to prevent further Russian attacks into Ukraine. Mykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelensky, insisted Ukraine was not interested in occupying Russia but wanted to persuade Russia to enter negotiations.   Moscow has called the incursion a major provocation and vowed to retaliate with a ""worthy response"". As Ukraine moves further into western Russian territory, Russian forces are equally making gains in Ukraine's east and have claimed a string of villages in recent weeks. It comes as the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog warned the nuclear safety situation at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating, following a drone strike near the site's perimeter. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said he remained ""extremely concerned"" and called for ""maximum restraint from all sides"" to protect the plant. The agency said the impact of the strike was on a road just outside the facility - close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line.  The plant was seized by Russia's forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks which both sides have blamed the other for.  Last week, Kyiv and Moscow traded blame after a fire broke out in one of the plant's cooling towers. The IAEA did not say who carried out Saturday's strike, but its team stationed at Zaporizhzhia said the damage seemed to have been caused by a drone carrying an explosive. ""The team has heard frequent explosions, repetitive heavy machine gun and rifle fire and artillery at various distances from the plant,"" the agency said in a statement. The plant has not produced power in more than two years and all six reactors have been in cold shutdown since April. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022 and has been making slow progress recently in seizing more territory in eastern Ukraine. However, it was shocked when Ukrainian troops penetrated into its Kursk region where they have been consolidating positions for nearly two weeks.  Thousands of Russians have been evacuated from the area. It is the first time foreign troops have been on Russian soil since World War Two."

As with the Olympic Games, the Paralympics opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in the French capital. The main ceremony was staged at Place de la Concorde, on a perfect summer evening in the heart of the city, following a parade along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees from the iconic Arc de Triomphe. Organisers estimated 65,000 people would be present, with spectators able to watch the parade for free before the ticketed open-air event. The first of 11 days of sporting action takes place on Thursday as France hosts a summer Paralympic Games for the first time. About 4,400 athletes from a record 168 delegations are set to take part in the 22 Paralympic sports, competing for a total of 549 gold medals in Paris. Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, said the opening ceremony represented the start of ""the Paralympic revolution"" led by the athletes. ""What makes you revolutionaries is that, when they told you 'no', you continued,"" Estanguet said. ""Tonight, you are inviting us to change our perspectives, change our attitudes, change our society to finally give every person their full place. ""Every emotion that you make us feel will carry a message that will never be forgotten: You have no limits, so let us stop imposing limits on you."" France's delegation arrived at the Place de la Concorde to a huge ovation Artistic director Thomas Jolly had promised the opening ceremony would be ""a spectacle that will showcase the Paralympic athletes and the values that they embody"". The staging of the event at the Place de la Concorde - the largest square in Paris - was designed as a symbol of the city putting the issue of inclusion for people with disabilities at the heart of society. While the Olympic Games had athletes travelling on boats down the River Seine in torrential rain, the opening ceremony for the Paralympic Games saw a parade take place on the route along the Champs-Elysees under golden skies. The delegations made their way along the Champs-Elysees to Place de la Concorde French former Paralympic swimmer Theo Curin was the star of the opening segment, transporting athletes in a taxi decorated by Phryges - the Paris 2024 mascot adapted for the Paralympics with a running blade. A series of artistic displays featuring performers with disabilities and impairments highlighted societal issues around inclusivity, the paradox of a world claiming to be inclusive but which remains full of prejudice a central theme. Blue, white and red smoke of the Tricolore was released by the Patrouille de France aerial display before the athletes made their entrance, while French singer Christine and the Queens also took to the main stage at the Place de la Concorde. A series of artistic performances marked the start of the opening ceremony British prime minister Keir Starmer was in attendance to welcome the ParalympicsGB delegation in to a party atmosphere, where the athletes arrived against the backdrop of a setting sun behind the Arc de Triomphe. Wheelchair tennis athlete Lucy Shuker and wheelchair basketball player Terry Bywater, contesting their fifth and seventh Games respectively, carried the British flag for ParalympicsGB after being voted as flagbearers by their team-mates. Sprinter Nantenin Keita and Para-triathlete Alexis Hanquinquant were on flag duties for host nation France, the final delegation to enter the Place de la Concorde, soaking up huge applause amid a rendition of Les Champs-Elysees. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Great Britain's paralympians arrive at the opening ceremony Following speeches by Estanguet and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons, French president Emmanuel Macron declared the Games officially open. Parsons said: ""The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games will show persons with disabilities what they can achieve at the highest level. ""The fact that these opportunities largely exist only in sport in the year 2024 is shocking. It is proof that we can and must do more to advance disability. ""That is why 225 years on from when Place de la Concorde was central to the French Revolution, I hope that Paris 2024 starts a Paralympic revolution - the inclusion revolution."" Twelve Paralympic champions formed part of the Paralympic flame parade, as it was transported to the Jardin des Tuileries. There the cauldron was lit by flagbearers Keita and Hanquinquant, Charles Antoine Kouakou, Fabien Lamirault and Elodie Lorandi, before being raised into the sky as the ceremony concluded with an eye-catching firework display. IPC president Parsons said in the lead-up to the Games that he believes Paris will deliver ""the most spectacular Paralympic Games ever"". Two million tickets have been sold, with about 500,000 still available. Many venues used during the Olympic Games are again in use for the Paralympics, with the athletics taking place at Stade de France, swimming at La Defense Arena, wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros and Para-equestrian at Chateau de Versailles. The Para-triathlon will take place in the centre of Paris, with the swim leg set to be held in the River Seine after the men's Olympic triathlon was delayed by a day and training sessions were cancelled because of poor water quality. As in the Olympics, Russia and ally Belarus are banned amid the ongoing war in Ukraine but some athletes from those nations are allowed to participate as part of a Neutral Paralympic Athletes (NPA) delegation. Eritrea, Kiribati and Kosovo will be represented in the Paralympics for the first time, while eight athletes will compete for the Paralympic Refugee Team. A team of 215 athletes will represent ParalympicsGB, with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport. Channel 4 will show the Games in the UK while BBC Radio 5 Live will have commentary, updates and dedicated programmes, and the BBC Sport website will have daily live text commentary.

Dubbed Portraits of Resilience, Louise Pasterfield's exhibition at Truro Cathedral features what she describes as the ""faces of Ukraine"". Ms Pasterfield said her endeavour began with a portrait of Valentina, a Ukrainian whose back yard had just been hit by artillery - captured by New York Times photographer Lynsey Addario. Her watercolour version made an impact on Instagram, she said, and sparked an unexpected wave of  people from Ukraine sending photographs and requesting she paint them.  ""One woman sent me a photo that she took of her two-year-old daughter on the second day of the war,"" said Ms Pasterfield.  ""It was taken in the basement of their house in the Kharkiv region.  ""They had no electricity, no heating, no water, and outside, the Russian army was all around them.  ""In the photograph, her daughter is painting by candlelight, wrapped up against the cold. “Other people have sent me photos of family members who have died in the war.  ""One woman sent me a photo of her father who died near Bakhmut, asking me if I could paint it. That was very moving.” Ms Pasterfield has painted 200 portraits over move than two years, and said people from Ukraine have thanked her for ""not forgetting"".  She spotted a video on social media of one of the defenders of Mariupol being reunited with his wife after he was released from Russian captivity.  Her painting of the couple, inspired by the short clip, brought this message from the woman: “You have painted one of the most important moments of my life.” She added: “It wasn’t about copying the photographs; it was about seeing something else. ""When you stare at a photograph for 14 hours, you begin to see different things. ""I choose ones where I think I can bring something new and amplify the inherent emotions.” She said her goal was to make people ""aware of what's happening"", to ""tell stories"" - but also to ""give hope"".  Some of her paintings were featured online by Vogue UA, Elle UA and Ukraine Artists on Instagram. The exhibition of 50 paintings is at Truro Cathedral from 17 to 27 August, coinciding with Ukrainian Independence Day on 24 August.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5ekxlwzgo,Robert F Kennedy Jr suspends campaign and backs Trump,"Trump praises RFK Jr as ""phenomenal"" at a rally, but members of the Kennedy clan accuse him of ""betrayal"".",24 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:31.584619,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Independent White House candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has joined the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, on stage at a rally in Arizona after dropping out of the race and endorsing the former US president. Mr Kennedy, 70, a Democrat for most of his life and the scion of the Kennedy dynasty, said the principles that had led him to leave the party had now compelled him ""to throw my support to President Trump"". He said in a press conference in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday that he would seek to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states.   Before welcoming RFK Jr to the stage on Friday, Trump promised, if elected, to release all remaining documents relating to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy. Trump praised Mr Kennedy as ""phenomenal"" and ""brilliant"" at the rally later in Glendale. Democratic rival Kamala Harris said she would try to ""earn"" the support of Kennedy voters. With November's election looming, Mr Kennedy's polling has slumped from a high of double figures as funds and national coverage dried up. The son of US Senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of President John F Kennedy, he is from the most famed family in Democratic politics.  Mr Kennedy's decision to back a Republican for the White House has outraged his relatives, who previously condemned his invocation of the family name in a Super Bowl ad back in February. Kerry Kennedy, his sister, said his support for Trump was a ""betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.""  “This decision is agonising for me because of the difficulties it causes my wife and my children and my friends,” Mr Kennedy said on Friday. “But I have the certainty that this is what I’m meant to do. And that certainty gives me internal peace, even in storms.” He is married to Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm. She posted on X, formerly Twitter, that she deeply respected her husband’s decision to suspend his campaign. She did not comment on his endorsement of Trump. Mr Kennedy told reporters on Friday that Trump's insistence he could end the war in Ukraine by negotiating with Russia ""alone would justify my support for his campaign"". ""There are still many issues and approaches on which we continue to have very serious differences. But we are aligned on other key issues."" He said he would remove his name from 10 states where his presence would be a ""spoiler"" to Trump's effort. He has already withdrawn from the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania. But it is too late for him to pull out from the swing states of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, election officials told AP news agency. Mr Kennedy said he had launched his campaign in April 2023 ""as a Democrat, the party of my father, my uncle... the champions of the Constitution"". But he left because ""it had become the party of war, censorship, corruption, big pharma, big tech, big money"".  He blamed his decision to suspend his campaign on ""media control"" and his former party's efforts to thwart his run, adding: ""In my heart I no longer believe I have a realistic path to victory in the face of relentless and systematic censorship."" Mr Kennedy hovered around 14% - 16% in polls at his most popular. However, his ratings have slumped to single digits since Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee.  He said in his press conference that he had offered to work with Ms Harris and her bid for the White House. Democrats sounded unfazed by his announcement.  ""Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance,"" Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement. Mr Kennedy's campaign became synonymous with the anti-vaccine movement as he frequently touted his leadership of the Children's Health Defense organisation, formerly known as the World Mercury Project. In recent weeks, Mr Kennedy recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub that had been hit by a car in New York's Central Park in 2014 as a joke.  Earlier in his campaign, it was revealed that he had suffered from a brain parasite over a decade ago which caused severe memory loss and brain fog. His announcement capped days of rumour that Mr Kennedy offered to endorse Trump to secure a role in his next administration.  Trump told CNN earlier this week he would ""certainly be open"" to Mr Kennedy playing a role, while Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, said he would be suited to ""blow up"" a federal department.  Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, told the BBC that Mr Kennedy's decision highlighted the two-party system in the US and ""how difficult it is to get new ideas and fresh people into the process"".  Mike Wendling also contributed to this report.

York Ukrainian Society started offering language skills and administration support to those Ukrainians who had settled in North Yorkshire with a bi-weekly meet-up in 2022. Following a request from members, the group's co-founder Maryana Mukha has started running artistic sessions. The group now offers practical activities including painting, clay modelling, drama and singing, which Ms Mukha said had really helped members with their mental wellbeing. “We found out that they [the attendees] really feeling much better, the impact on their mental health is much nicer,"" she said. ""When they are around friends they can just chat about anything.” Ms Mukha said she began the group because she wanted newcomers to have a better experience than when she arrived 11 years ago. “I remember when I came to this country, I wasn’t very confident with the English but that was developing more and more and I actually remembered myself that if someone had helped here I would have been further ahead."" she said. The group, which is based in St Michael’s Church in Spurriergate, initially supported people with their mental  health and helped them to complete forms and register with GPs and schools. Now, the group can host between 10 to 20 people or run special sessions for between 100 and 200 people. Many of those who attend are women with children who find it difficult to keep their children occupied especially during the summer holidays. While English lessons have helped many participants become more independent, Ms Mukha said it was important to help them retain their Ukrainian identity. ""The children are doing Ukrainian lessons and sometimes if they need support with some English conversations we provide this support,” Mrs Mukha said. “Lots of them are desperate to go back to Ukraine, they have everything there but they don’t feel safe there with small children. ""They feel more Ukrainian in the UK because they have started to use their language.” She said the art sessions helped the members feel happy and encouraged them to make friends and interact with each other. Yuliia Kiriienko has been coming to the group for six months. ""It’s very helpful for us, we can gather together and speak to each other, share stories with each other and understand each other,"" she said. It is her first time painting as she struggles to find time around looking after her six-year-old daughter Vera. She said being able to bring Vera means she can spend time with other Ukrainian children. York Ukrainian Society’s co-founder Maryana Mukha is a finalist in the community award category of BBC Radio York’s Make a Difference Awards.

An alleged plot to assassinate Germany’s top weapons manufacturer. Phone taps on a high-level Luftwaffe call. These aren’t storylines lifted from a 1960s spy novel but real-life events in Germany, this year. Not all of these events can definitively be blamed on Moscow, but Germany is on heightened alert for possible acts of Russian sabotage, because of Berlin’s continued military support for Kyiv. As a hot war rages between Russia and Ukraine, there are fears that Europe has slipped into a new Cold War. “When we think of the Cold War, we have a tendency to think of the 1970s by which point the rules of the game had become established and accepted,” says Mark Galeotti, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) and director of Mayak Intelligence. “In some way, we’re in the early Cold War – the Fifties and Sixties, so a much rawer time.” But what does a rekindled Cold War look like for Europe’s biggest economy and a country that was once itself cut in half by the Iron Curtain? The biggest bombshell dropped just last month when CNN reported that US officials had told Berlin of an alleged Russian plot to kill the chief executive of Germany’s biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The Kremlin denied the report but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who strikes a hawkish figure next to the more hesitant Chancellor Olaf Scholz, hit out at Russia for “waging a hybrid war of aggression"". I met Rheinmetall’s CEO, Armin Papperger, at a ground-breaking ceremony for a new ammunition factory in February. The 61-year-old is, to use a crude term, a real “somebody”, particularly in a world where Nato countries are spending billions to re-supply Ukraine and boost their own security. His prominent position was clear as he stood alongside Chancellor Scholz, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen as they plunged spades into the earth in Lower Saxony. Had a plot to kill him been successful, it would have sent shockwaves through the West. A security blunder not long afterwards allowed spies to eavesdrop on a highly sensitive conversation between senior German air force officials, later broadcast on Russian TV. It was a cause of acute embarrassment for Berlin given that a brigadier general in the Luftwaffe appeared to allow spies into the secure call by dialling in on an insecure line. The mega-blip, however isolated, fuelled accusations that Germany has long been a “weak link” within the European counter-intelligence due to a fragmented, federalised system that’s underpinned by a strong emphasis on individuals’ privacy. Weeks later, two German-Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of planning to sabotage US military facilities in Bavaria. Annalena Baerbock summoned the Russian ambassador to complain and announced: “We will not allow Putin to bring his terror to Germany.” Only last week, holes were found cut into the fences of water facilities supplying two military bases in North Rhine-Westphalia, with concerns that someone has been seeking to contaminate supplies.  Germany is not the only European country being targeted by apparent acts of sabotage, but it has a lot of US military bases that were established in the wake of World War Two. Mark Galeotti believes Moscow views Germany as a large but “flabby” power, making it the ideal pressure point. By anyone’s measure, the greatest act of known sabotage to affect Germany in recent years was when the Nord Stream gas pipelines, running under the Baltic Sea from Russia, were blown up in 2022. Speculation over who ordered the attack has been rife ever since, but in a dramatic development Germany has now issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor. Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that the “shoestring” operation had been privately funded but overseen from Ukraine. Kyiv rejected the report as nonsense, and while there was always scepticism that President Putin would order the destruction of his own pipeline, it does show that the murky world of espionage can be full of twists and turns. Each incident of apparent sabotage cannot, by any means, be immediately and certainly attributed to Russia. In France it was far-left activists, not Russian agents, who were accused of targeting the country’s high-speed rail network on the eve of the Olympics. And Germany has had its own, extensive, history of far-left militant attacks. The fact that Ukrainian figures are now under the spotlight for the Nord Stream blasts has fuelled fresh criticism from familiar political wings, within Germany, about the government’s support for Kyiv. Co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Deutschland, Alice Weidel, has called for “aid payments” to Kyiv to be halted and the damage to Nord Stream “billed” to Ukraine. The AfD enjoys much of its support in the former communist east, where beyond Berlin you’re more likely to find lingering affection for Russia and dissatisfaction with the main parties that have, since reunification, dominated national politics. So as Cold War comparisons hover over European security, the politics of that period has also renewed itself in Germany in a stark and unexpected way. In a bid to bolster security, the German government is working on a new law aimed at boosting resilience of critical infrastructure. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser says there must be “maximum protective measures in all areas”. Operators in critical sectors such as energy, transport and water will have to follow minimum security standards, under the Kritis Umbrella Act. It’s the first federal law of its kind in Germany but yet to gain final approval despite heightened tensions surrounding the war. German-made armoured Marder vehicles are reportedly being used in Ukraine’s surprise operation inside Russian territory. That would mark yet another German foreign policy taboo being broken since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Add to that contentious plans for the US to station long-range missiles in Germany from 2026. When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Chancellor Sholz promised a “Zeitenwende”, or turning point in national defence and security policy. But supporters and critics of the government alike acknowledge that reversing years of underinvestment in defence will take time – as will adjusting a mentality so influenced by Germany’s dark past. Given recent developments, there’s a question mark over how long Berlin has. Mark Galeotti says it is not just rebuilding defence but upgrading cyber-security and improving counter-intelligence. “Security planning doesn’t happen over weeks or months but years.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy54r9r1355o,Energy prices forecast to rise by 9% in October,A forecaster says bills will rise in the run-up to winter while experts say few cheap fixed deals exist.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:39.790003,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Domestic energy prices are expected to rise in the run-up to winter, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight. The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay £1,714 a year from October. That would be a £146 a year rise compared with a current typical annual bill - the lowest for two years - of £1,568. Energy regulator Ofgem will announce the next official quarterly price cap on Friday, with charities concerned about the prospect of prices rising again. Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less. That is because the cap limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity, rather than the total bill.  It affects 28 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The sector is regulated separately in Northern Ireland.  Cornwall Insight said prices paid by households, although protected to some degree by the price cap, were affected by volatility in the fragile global energy market. Wholesale costs, paid by suppliers, had risen by about 20% in the last few months, it said. These are reflected in consumer bills, accounting for about half of what customers pay.  With prices set to rise, some billpayers might look at the options available to fix their energy tariff. Cornwall Insight said that the average saving from the top 10 cheapest tariffs on the market in August was only £5 a year, compared with a default tariff set by the price cap.  That may change in the coming weeks, and Richard Neudegg, from price comparison website Uswitch, said there were options for those who wanted certainty. ""Just because it is a fix, it doesn't mean it is a good price fix,"" he said. ""The question for consumers is, if they want that level of certainty, how cheaply can they get it.""  Cornwall Insight also said it expected costs to rise again during the winter, when the January price cap is announced.   It said a ""modest"" rise was anticipated. However, recent tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war could see prices rise further, it added. ""While we don't expect a return to the extreme prices of recent years, it's unlikely that bills will return to what was once considered normal. Without significant intervention, this may well be the new normal,"" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at the forecaster. Charity National Energy Action said any increases in prices, alongside less support from the government, could stretch some households' finances ""beyond breaking point"". Standing charges, a fixed daily fee covering the costs of connecting to a supply, currently stand at at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region. Ofgem is currently considering whether to change the standing charge billing system. Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises, but are much higher than before the pandemic. Experts have shared three tips to keep on top of energy use during the warmer months: Read more here if you are struggling to pay energy bills"

Ashford Borough Council says 2024 marks the town's 60th anniversary of twinning with Bad Münstereifel, in Germany, and the 40th anniversary of its pairing with  Fougères, in France. The town is hosting a special anniversary visit in September and the Ashford Twinning Association (ATA) is running a free exhibition showcasing the relationships. The council said: ""ATA would be delighted to hear from anyone who’d like to get involved, particularly people who may want to host guests from one of the twin towns."" Ashford's connection with Bad Münstereifel began in 1919, when it was occupied by British troops and Major J Goode formed bonds that lasted throughout World War One and World War Two, the council said. The towns were officially twinned in 1964, it added. The idea behind the initiative was to give young people from Germany and Britain a chance to get to know each other better.. The town's Fougères connection began in 1978, followed by an official ceremony in 1984. Bad Münstereifel and Fougères are also twinned with each, and the partnerships between all three go beyond official annual civic visits.  The council said: ""They extend to youth and school visits, exchanges between local organisations, sports clubs and associations such as the Ashford Beekeepers."" The council's portfolio holder for tourism and culture, Heather Hayward, said: “We are very proud of Ashford’s long history with our twin towns, and we are looking forward to hosting them on such a special year for us all.""

Lioness Yuna is expected to arrive at the Big Cat Sanctuary in Smarden, near Ashford, on Friday. Rori, a male lion, is expected to join her in a few months, but is being temporarily housed at an animal rescue centre in Belgium while his enclosure in Kent is prepared. The Big Cat Sanctuary plans to rescue a total of five lions from their previous homes in Ukraine, but needs to raise a total of £500,000 to do so. Three-year-old Yuna had been kept with another lion near Kyiv, and was traumatised when debris from a missile attack landed 300m (984ft) from their small enclosure. Rori, also three, had been kept as part of a private menagerie which was disbanded after the Russian invasion, and may have been used for illegal breeding. The operation to bring the two lions to the UK has taken months to plan alongside the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and the journey has taken four days to complete, travelling through six countries. Cam Whitnall from the Big Cat Sanctuary said: “It’s been a huge effort from everyone involved. We have worked night and day for many months for this very moment and we can’t wait to get them to their forever home now here at the sanctuary.” The other lions scheduled to be brought to the sanctuary are Vanda, a one-year-old female being kept as a pet in south-eastern Ukraine, and Ama and Lira, also one and thought to have been bred illegally. So far £300,000 of the £500,000 needed for the project has been raised after an appeal was launched in May. Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

It is understood that the current requirement, that a certain proportion of union members need to vote for strike action for it be legal, would no longer apply. Shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake is quoted as saying that ''it will be businesses and consumers that pay the price, and growth that suffers"". ''Half of Labour MPs in pay of unions” is the headline for the Daily Mail. The paper says that, based on figures in the MPs’ register of interests, 213 of the 404 Labour MPs took union money to help them fight the election. A Labour spokesperson said all donations were declared in line with parliamentary and Electoral Commission rules. Workers who are regularly contacted by their boss out of hours could get thousands of pounds in compensation, according to the Times. It says the government is looking to Ireland and Belgium for inspiration on its proposed ''right to switch off'' policy. The paper says that although it is unlikely that employees could take legal action for this alone, it could be used as an aggravating factor in a broader claim against their employer. A government source said the details were still being drawn up. A former Victims' Commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, has told the Daily Express that men who repeatedly abuse women should be sentenced as quickly as those who have been prosecuted for the recent disorder in England. Dame Vera writes that male violence against women and girls is ""almost always poorly and slowly dealt with by police and the wider criminal justice system, which offers no deterrent''. The Daily Telegraph also reports that the prime minister has been urged to rethink his refusal to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles produced in the UK to hit targets deep inside Russia. The paper has spoken to four former Conservative defence secretaries, who say the UK is failing to provide Ukraine with the support it needs.  A Ministry of Defence spokesman tells the Telegraph there has been “no change in the UK’s position” when it comes to Storm Shadow missiles. An investigation by the i paper has found that thousands of children and teenagers have had vapes or drinks spiked in the past three years. The figures come from a Freedom of Information request to police forces in England and Wales. The paper says there is particular concern about vapes being laced with the synthetic drug, spice.  Pakistan's jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan has applied to become the next chancellor of Oxford University, according to papers including the Guardian. One of his advisers is said to have confirmed his candidacy for the election in October. The paper says Mr Khan is an Oxford graduate and previously served as chancellor of the University of Bradford for seven years. ''Bank on record traffic for big August getaway'', is the warning in the Daily Mirror. The motoring organisation the RAC says its data indicates that 19 million trips will be made between this Friday and Monday, which would make it the busiest August bank holiday since its records began in 2015.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql365ld002o,Ukraine's surprise advance into Russia a dilemma for Biden,The way US weapons are used in the war keeps changing - US officials are assessing how Putin might react.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:40.153074,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Washington is absorbing the impact of Ukraine’s lightning assault into Russia’s Kursk region as the scale of President Zelensky’s bold gamble emerges. US officials are assessing how the incursion might reshape the political and military dynamics of the war, as well as the implications for Washington’s long-shifting stance on how Ukraine can use American-supplied arms. The stunning raid, catching both Russian and apparently Western leaders by surprise, highlights one of the riskiest dilemmas for the Western-backed defence of Ukraine: President Biden has consistently tried to empower Kyiv to push back Russia’s invasion without risking an American escalation with Moscow.  As President Putin has always tried to portray the conflict as a war between Russia and the West, Mr Biden has sought to put clear limits on US policy to deflate that narrative and prevent a conflagration. But Ukraine’s Kursk assault - the largest incursion into Russia by a foreign military since World War Two, according to military analysts - has raised a series of urgent questions for the White House.  Does it rapidly expand the boundaries of Washington’s set limits for how Ukraine can use American and Nato weapons systems?  Does it risk crossing Russia’s red lines over Western involvement in the war? If not, has President Zelensky showed Washington he can call Mr Putin’s bluff? Despite the risks and the uncertainty, there is a sense of surprised admiration among some in Washington at Mr Zelensky's move. Piecing together comments from US officials over the last week reveals something of the emerging position.  The administration insists Ukraine gave it no advance warning of the assault. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre has said Washington had ""nothing to do"" with it. As for the use of US weapons, the White House, Pentagon and State Department won't officially confirm whether they are being used, but it seems overwhelmingly clear that they are, given Ukraine’s reliance on US and Nato weapons systems.  Vladislav Seleznyov, a former spokesman for the Ukrainian armed forces' general staff, told Voice of America that US-provided HIMAR rocket launchers had been critical to the advance.  US approval for the use of its weapons by Ukraine in the Kursk incursion is certainly being implicitly given. Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder said this week: ""We assess that they're within the policy boundaries that we've set. Those policies haven't changed as it relates to in particular to use of US weapons.""  Officials say the assault is ""consistent"" with their policy ""from the very beginning"" for Ukraine to be able to defend itself against attacks coming across the border. But Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh added: ""Again, we don't support long range attacks into Russia. These are more for crossfire. I'm not going to put a specific range on it."" The US is the single biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - making the relationship the most consequential for Ukraine’s prospects. Just last week the Pentagon authorised its 63rd tranche of equipment in three years, including Stinger missiles and artillery shells.  But since the start of the Russian invasion President Biden's approach has been characterised by at first a refusal to send more even advanced weapons - including, consecutively, HIMARS rockets, Patriot missile defence systems and F-16 fighter jets - before later changing his mind. The same goes for White House policy on Ukrainian attacks into Russian territory. For many months President Zelensky pleaded for permission to strike at military targets in Russia that facilitated attacks into Ukraine.  In May, Mr Biden finally authorised the use of US weapons to strike across the border into Russia but only in a limited range from the Kharkiv region - which was under Russian assault. The White House described Ukraine’s permitted actions as ""counter-strike"" measures. ""They're authorised to be used in proximity to the border when [Russian military sites] are being used on the other side of the border to attack specific targets in Ukraine,"" said Mr Biden in June. ""We're not authorising strikes 200 miles into Russia and we're not authorising strikes on Moscow, on the Kremlin."" A few weeks later, that same permission was extended to any point along the border where Russian forces were preparing to attack Ukraine. Since then, Mr Zelensky, along with some European allies and some Democrats in Washington, have urged the US to further ""untie"" Ukraine’s hands.  Specifically, the Ukrainian leader wants to be able to use American-provided ATACMS or long range missiles to fire deep into Russia to take out drone or missile launch sites. Washington has refused. Hovering ominously over all of such decisions are the warnings of President Putin, who has previously threatened to use ""all available means"" if Russia’s territorial integrity is threatened. This in addition to his nuclear sabre rattling if he deems the West as posing an intolerable threat to Russia via the Ukraine war. Ultimately, President Biden's stance could be summed up as this: Ukraine can decide how best to defend itself using American weapons, including strikes across the border, but within very clear limits - including not using long-range missiles.  The words he used in June suggested that Ukraine’s limits were ""in proximity to the border"". The Kursk offensive takes America’s dilemma into unexpected territory - literally and figuratively. Ukraine’s incursion is a cross-border ground assault, reportedly involving anywhere between 5,000 to 12,000 troops.  Some unconfirmed Russian reports have suggested its forces could have advanced up to 30km into Russia.  By the middle of this week Kyiv said its forces were in control of 1,000 sq km of Russian territory, including more than 70 villages and towns, and had captured hundreds of prisoners of war. Russian officials said around 132,000 people had been evacuated from their homes. With US officials still reluctant to talk about it publicly in any detail, my sense is that they are still working out what it means for the state of the battlefield, the future of the war and how this is affecting Putin’s calculations.  If Mr Zelensky was frustrated at what he perceived as too much caution or slow decision making from President Biden over arms authorisations, he may be trying to show him he can force both his - and Vladimir Putin's - hand. It is a daring gamble."

Yulia, 41, fled her home city of Zhytomyr, Ukraine, in August 2023 with her 13-year-old son and the pair found a home in Leicestershire, under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. But after their sponsors’ hosting period came to an end, the family are now in need of a property before the start of the academic year. Yulia wants to live near her son’s school in Rutland, but there’s concern a lack of suitable options will leave them with little choice but to move back to Ukraine, so her son can study there when school starts on 1 September. She said: “This is a scary situation for me, this is very bad for my son. “We can’t stay homeless. If I don’t find anywhere, we need to come back to Ukraine.” Harborough District Council has offered Yulia a home in Kettering, but due to the long distance from her son’s school, she turned it down. Yulia added it was a difficult decision to come to England, but now her son feels settled and well-supported at his school, she would rather return home to Ukraine than force him to study elsewhere. Colin Gordon, a friend of Yulia who teaches English to Ukrainian refugees, said her situation raises question marks of the Homes for Ukraine scheme and the opportunities available to refugees once their sponsors can no longer host them. “Where will they find extra spare accommodation?"" he said.  ""It's more likely in the affluent rural areas, like Rutland, rather than inner-cities. ""That means less transport opportunities and less job opportunities."" Yulia has temporarily been taken in by another Ukrainian family living in Market Harborough, but said there is a shortage of space. A joint statement from Leicestershire County Council and Harborough District Council said: “Leicestershire County Council’s Homes for Ukraine team will be supporting the family and working with the housing authority, Harborough District Council, to find a housing solution.” The council said that since March 2022, 1,214 Ukrainians have arrived in the county, with 356 still being hosted as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  Rutland County Council added that it was aware of Yulia’s case and has proactively looked at suitable sponsors under the scheme, but there are currently none in the wider Rutland area. A government spokesperson said: “Our Ukraine schemes are kept under continual review as we look to provide stability for those we have welcomed to the UK and those who still need our sanctuary. “Local councils play a crucial role in this effort, as they are responsible for supporting individuals on the Homes for Ukraine scheme who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  ""This includes providing temporary accommodation to ensure that every family has a safe place to stay and feels secure in our country.” Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The warning came after the discovery of a fence cut at the water storage site in Mechernich area near Bonn. The all-clear was eventually given on Friday morning, although residents were urged to boil their water before drinking it. A day earlier, an air force base near Cologne-Bonn airport was sealed off for several hours with ""abnormal water values"" detected in the supply. Separately, Nato reported an attempt to trespass on its base at Geilenkirchen close to the Dutch border. The extent of sabotage in any of the three incidents remains unclear although Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, have been on heightened alert because of Russia's war in Ukraine. Nato's Awacs reconnaissance planes are stationed at Geilenkirchen and the Cologne-Wahn base close to the main regional airport is home to the top echelons of the German air force as well as planes used by government ministers for foreign travel. More than 5,000 soldiers and civilians are said to work at the Cologne-Wahn base, and although the outer fence was not tampered with, a hole was found in the fence close to the barracks' water supply. No-one has yet been detained for any of the three alleged sabotage incidents. Residents in Mechernich and surrounding towns and villages quickly stocked up on bottled water on Thursday night as the fire brigade drove around the area warning people not to use tap water for drinking, showers or preparing food, regional public broadcaster WDR reported. Military officials are taking the latest incidents very seriously. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said this week, even before the spate of scares, that Germany  was facing an increased danger of Russian sabotage. ""The threats we have to protect ourselves against range from espionage, sabotage and cyber attacks to state terrorism,"" she told Handelsblatt newspaper on Monday, explaining that the Ukrainian advance into Russian territory could exacerbate the threat.  German-supplied Marder armoured vehicles are apparently being used by the Ukrainians in the Kursk region. Germany is the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, earmarking some €28bn (£24bn) since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to recent figures. Only last month, the domestic intelligence service (Verfassungschutz) warned of an increased risk of sabotage activities and reports emerged of an alleged Russian plot to kill the head of Germany's biggest arms firm Rheinmetall. Last April, two German-Russian dual nationals were arrested in the south-western state of Bavaria on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks on military or industrial targets."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c134587zl01o,East meets west London - the mentor who changed Chelsea,Vinay Menon knew nothing about football when he went for a meeting at a West London mansion in 2009. A few weeks later he was in the heart of the Chelsea dressing room.,22 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:40.515480,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"East meets west London - the mentor who changed Chelsea Vinay Menon knew little about Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. He knew even less about football; he had never seen a match in his life. But as he approached the door of Abramovich's west London mansion in 2009, he was about to have a meeting that would change his life and transform him into, arguably, the most famous Indian in the sport. Born in Kerala and inspired by his maternal 'yogi' grandfather to pursue a career in wellness, Menon was a word-of-mouth recommendation to the Russian oligarch.  He was delivering wellness, yoga and relaxation exercises to billionaires and celebrities at a luxury hotel in Dubai, when the father of Abramovich's then-wife Dasha booked in for a session. Menon then came to London to run private classes for the Abramovichs. But Roman was so impressed by Menon that he sent him to Chelsea's Cobham training ground with a brief to work with the first-team squad as the Premier League's first wellness coach. ""Roman asked for it to happen and it happened,"" Menon says. ""I was an Indian, who was never exposed to football, entering a massive club and it seemed impossible. ""There was a big barrier, but it was not an immovable rock because it came from the owner himself - he initiated that change so everyone was ready to try."" Abramovich, pictured in 2009, bought Chelsea in a deal worth Â£140m in July 2003 Still, the arrival of Menon and his philosophy was a culture shock for a squad who had finished as either Premier League champions or runners-up in the previous five seasons.  ""We are talking about elite performance - change is always difficult,"" Menon says. ""Adding or taking away is always difficult, people don't want to change because they are already performing and winning. Why should they? ""Everyone treated me well but training the players wasn't easy initially. I should thank a few players, who were ready to try me."" None of the players were obliged to work with Menon. Instead his services were available if any felt they would be useful. Striker Didier Drogba quickly became Menon's key advocate. ""Didier was the initial one â Chelsea is like one big family and we just sat and ate in the canteen with the players and so we started a conversation organically while eating,"" says Menon. ""He asked what I can do for him, and I told him we can try this, and he asked me to try right away. That was the moment where football opened in front of me. ""After that Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, John Terry began coming to me to try it.  ""The medical department were fantastic and made me part of their team, despite being from a different discipline."" Menon's sessions involved meditation, sharpening players' mental approach and dispelling the negative thoughts that can come with top-flight pressure and scrutiny. ""I was a person without a title, teaching the players self-care and how to balance, spiritually, emotionally, and ultimately impact them physically,"" says Menon. ""They are human beings and need a friend to giggle with, babble to and then they will open up. ""You need to be happy in the mind in sports and business. Itâs the same â the mind is everything."" Menon was a constant presence in the Chelsea backroom staff for 13 years, working under managers such as Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte and, finally, Thomas Tuchel. ""I got the chance to be part of all the trophies Chelsea won from 2010,"" he says.  ""What an experience, it was an unbelievable space, I miss it a lot, frankly.â Menon celebrates Chelsea's 2021 Champions League final win over Manchester City with then-Blues manager Thomas Tuchel Menon was part of a huge cull of Chelsea staff, notably in the medical department, when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022 from Abramovich. Abramovich was forced to sell after being sanctioned for links to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The upheaval at the club has coincided with a run of injuries among Chelsea's squad but Menon backs the new owners to stabilise the club. ""Change is inevitable in life,"" he says. ""The old regime had a lot of success and put a big mark on the club.  ""Another management team came in which is very ambitious, very different, from a different region, understanding football on a different level. ""They need time to adapt, they are maybe in a sort of pre-season, I believe they will adapt. I worked with the new management and they are good. ""I wish them all the best; I am still a Chelsea fan and the club gave me everything I have."" Belgium's World Cup campaign ended in the group stages at Qatar 2022, with Morocco and Croatia qualifying for the knockout rounds ahead of them Menon blazed a new trail in 2022, travelling to the World Cup as part of Roberto Martinez's Belgium staff.  India â the most populous nation on earth â has never qualified for the tournament and Menon's presence caught the attention of his compatriots. ""This representation always helps my home country and the young generation to show that there is a career,"" he says. ""We can be in this arena.

Pastor Jim Morris of Life Church in Bedworth has made several trips to the country over the past two years and he and his team will set off again in October. They have four vans full of various items including medicine, nappies and clothing to be taken to the south of Zaporizhzhia. Mr Morris thanked the people of Coventry, Bedworth and Nuneaton for donating the items. ""Everything is a blessing,"" he said. ""We work with the governor of the state where we go and he's so grateful for everything we can get to him. ""A lot of homes have plywood in the windows after the glass has been blown out. ""A lot of the shops do not have food or medicine in them now.""  He said they had experienced some dangerous incidents during their trips to the country. ""We had two situations there where once, three bombs went off very close to the van and then at the second check-point, rockets went off very close to the van,"" he said. ""It actually shook the van. ""But when you consider what the people are doing, they're taking more risks than we are, because we only do it that once.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn02ggq8dpdo,'How many OAPs will freeze' and 'don't shoot',Front pages include Labour being accused of caving into union demands for pay rises and Ukraine's capture of Russian prisoners.,18 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:47.953970,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The Sunday Times has spoken to Russian troops captured by Ukraine, during Kyiv's incursion across the border into the Kursk region. The paper tells of their panic at Ukraine's surprise invasion. A 22-year-old architecture student reveals that he had never expected to find himself in battle, having been told only that his compulsory military service would be spent training. The paper paints a picture of chaos, desperation and disorder among the Russian ranks. ""Don't shoot we're conscripts"" is the headline. An interview with the Work and Pensions Secretary provides The Observer's lead story. Liz Kendall tells the paper it's time to end what she calls ""a blame culture"", aimed at people out of work . She says a ""drastic overhaul"" is needed to fix a ""broken"" back-to-work system. And she describes her task of bringing in major reforms as ""one of the biggest challenges the country faces"", with a near record 2.8 million people out of work because of long term sickness. The Sunday Telegraph highlights comments from the health ombudsman that clapping the NHS during the pandemic may have been dangerous because it put the organisation ""beyond criticism"". Rebecca Hilsenrath warns against treating the health service as a ""national religion"" and calls on its leaders to overhaul the culture and listen to those that it fails. Her office has submitted evidence to an investigation of the NHS, set up by the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting. It is due to be published next month. The Mail on Sunday says the Labour government's decision to settle public sector wage disputes - what it calls Sir Keir Starmer's ""capitulation to his union paymasters"" - will leave Britain with a £14bn bill. The paper says it has seen what it calls ""devastating analysis"" that the costs of pay deals for GPs, teachers and other workers will be far more than the £10bn set aside by the chancellor. Critics tell the paper the prime minister is treating taxpayers as ""cash machines"" to fund the rises. The Sunday Express claims the Chancellor Rachel Reeves has ""buried"" a report revealing what it says is the ""devastating"" impact of axing winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. The paper says she is believed to have ordered the assessment of how making the payments means-tested would hit vulnerable people, but is refusing to make it public. The headline asks ""How many OAPs will freeze this winter?"" The chancellor has said the decision was essential because of the state of the public finances left by the previous government. And the Sun on Sunday reports that King Charles is axing Prince Andrew's 10-strong private security team from his Royal Lodge in Windsor. The paper says the move puts the ""disgraced royal"" under new pressure to quit the 30-room mansion he's lived in for 20 years. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd7eryqd7ro,Circus 'unites' Russo-Ukrainian performers,The travelling show is performing in Stonham Barns over the weekend.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:48.052106,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Circus performers from Ukraine and Russia have said “art and culture unite people”, as they refuse to let the ongoing conflict between their homelands divide them. Circus Cortex is currently staging its Golden Age show at Stonham Barns, in Suffolk, with the final performance taking place on Monday evening. The travelling cast is made up of entertainers from across the globe, including Ukraine and Russia, which are currently at war with each other. Despite the fallout from the conflict, Ukrainian juggler and stick balancer, Valeri Tkach, said the cast is only focused on bringing people together. The 39-year-old, who was “wedged into” the circus after deciding to follow in his father’s footsteps, added: “This is not about politics. “This is about our common creative goal to make people happy by absorbing that energy – it is priceless and you cannot buy it. “You create and meet people and do these amazing projects and everybody is happy about what you do - and that makes you happy.” Show director Irina Archer, 47, has been part of the circus for 25 years, having initially started out as a rhythmic gymnast in Russia. Echoing Valeri, she said: “We have been operating for years now and we’ve always had Ukrainian artists and there still hasn’t been fallouts, so that tells you something. “In the circus we class ourselves as having a ‘circus nationality’ because across the world we are one circus family. “We all get on here and it doesn’t matter where you’re from, it doesn’t matter what language we speak. We’re here creating art - we’re not concentrating on politics.” The show includes dance and music and also the more traditional elements you would expect to see at a circus. Irina has now urged the people of Suffolk to flock to the circus over the weekend to both enjoy the show and also help change the perceptions some may have of it. “We want people to realise the circus is not a dirty word but actually something really cool and interesting for the whole family,” she added. “Performers are happy when they perform to a full audience, so we want people to come and then go and tell their friends how amazing the show is.” Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp0w149w1o,UK-donated tanks used in Kyiv's Russia incursion,Ukraine's surprise incursion has seen it make advances into territories across the Russian border.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:48.238086,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"UK-donated Challenger 2 tanks have been used by Ukraine as part of its surprise incursion into Russia, a UK source has confirmed.  The Ministry of Defence is not officially commenting on what specific UK weapons are being used by Ukraine. However, following Kyiv's incursion into Russian territory, the ministry reiterated that Ukraine had ""a clear right"" to use UK-supplied weapons for ""self-defence against Russia's illegal attacks"". ""That does not preclude operations inside Russia,"" a spokesman added. ""We make clear during the gifting process that equipment is to be used in line with international law."" The policy means anti-tank missiles, artillery, armoured vehicles and other UK-donated weapons could be used during Ukraine's offensive.  However, there is an exception for the UK's Storm Shadow missiles which were originally supplied on the understanding they would not be fired at targets inside Russia.  The missiles are fired from aircraft but have a range of more than 150 miles, meaning Ukrainian pilots are able to stay further away from the front line.  No western country has given Kyiv the green light to use their long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia.  During his visit to Downing Street in July, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the UK to work with western allies to ""remove the limits"" on the use of the weapons. He told senior ministers that giving Ukraine ""long-range capability"" would force Russia to ""seek peace"".  Defence Secretary John Healey told the BBC the UK was having ""intense discussions"" on the subject, but he would not go into details in public.  The UK was one of the first countries to supply Ukraine with western-made main battle tanks. In 2023, it provided 14 Challenger 2 tanks to help Ukraine in its doomed summer offensive. One of the tanks was destroyed in the thwarted operation.  Few would have envisioned that some of these tanks would end up fighting in Russia itself.  Since Ukraine's recent advance into Russian territory, there have been sightings of western-supplied armour inside Russia, including US Bradley and Stryker armoured vehicles as well as German Marders. None of those countries has raised objections about its equipment being used in the offensive.  In truth, few would have known Ukraine’s intentions given the secrecy surrounding this operation. Western military experts have highlighted the success of the Ukrainian offensive for its use of what they call ""combined arms manoeuvres"" – using troops alongside armoured vehicles, artillery and tanks as well as electronic warfare and drones – to attack.  That was something missing from last year’s Ukrainian offensive in the south and east of the country - which was impeded by heavily-mined Russian fortifications making it difficult and dangerous to operate armour. There may still be concerns in the West about what happens next, including that Ukraine could suffer significant losses and come back asking for more.  More importantly, some may worry about how Russia responds and the possibility of escalation.  The Kremlin has already accused the West of being behind the attack on its territory and the fact Western weapons are involved provides a basis for that charge.  Ukraine surprised Russia and its allies when it launched its offensive into Russia's western border region of Kursk.  The amount of Russian territory seized is uncertain, with both countries making conflicting statements. Russia has declared a state of emergency in its Kursk and Belgorod regions. Yan Furtsev, a local official with Russia's liberal opposition party Yabloko, told the BBC about 180,000 civilians in Kursk needed to be evacuated.  The operation by Kyiv appears to be aimed at diverting Russia forces away from Ukraine in order to defend its own border.  The incursion has raised questions about how Ukraine uses weapons donated by its western allies. Speaking to BBC's Newshour programme, Latvia's Foreign Minister Baiba Braze said a ""consultation among legal experts within Nato countries"" had concluded that ""the right to self defence also covers the right to counter-attack"". Earlier this year, David Cameron, then the UK's foreign secretary, said Ukraine ""absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia"".  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said his remarks were tantamount to admitting the West was involved in a ""hybrid war"" against Moscow. The UK is one of the biggest donors of military aid to Ukraine, behind the US and Germany. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rxlygvnx6o,"Climate Q&A: Population, volcanoes and electric cars",Every week we've been answering some of your questions on climate and the environment.,16 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:48.333035,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The BBC’s Future Earth newsletter, with Justin Rowlatt, brings the latest news on climate and the environment to your inbox every week.  We also answer questions from our readers, on topics ranging from carbon emissions and clean technologies to volcanic activity and the impact of war on climate change. We’ve compiled some of our favourite questions and answers so far below.  If you’re in the UK and want to sign up for the newsletter, you can do that here. If you're outside the UK, sign up here. First and foremost, the war in Ukraine has been a humanitarian disaster. But it has also had implications for the climate. There are extra greenhouse gas emissions associated with war itself, such as warfare materials, fires triggered by the conflict, and rebuilding of destroyed infrastructure. The damage also greatly hampers efforts for Ukraine to prepare itself for extreme weather events, potentially making the impacts of climate change on the country even worse. But there have been consequences for global energy trends too. After Russia invaded in February 2022, energy prices spiked and many Western countries pledged to wean themselves off Russian gas. In some countries this has led to a sharper focus on deploying renewables and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, in a bid to enhance long-term energy security. But to replace gas piped in from Russia in the shorter term, some countries have also begun expanding infrastructure to ship in liquified natural gas from other parts of the world. Liquified natural gas is often far more carbon-intensive than piped gas, because of the energy required to compress the gas into liquid form and transport it. Volcanic eruptions can have significant effects on the global climate. One of the most famous cases is Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which erupted in 1991. It released nearly 20 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, which formed sulphate aerosols. These tiny particles reflected some of the Sun’s energy back into space, cooling the planet by an estimated 0.5C over the following two years or so. When it comes to long-term warming, human activities are unquestionably to blame. Natural factors such as volcanic eruptions made effectively no difference to global temperatures averaged over the past decade. There has been much speculation about the massive eruption of the underwater Hunga Tonga volcano at the start of 2022. But it is thought that it had at most a minor effect on global temperatures, and certainly cannot explain the record temperatures of 2023. China is currently the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases per year, at nearly 14 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in 2022.  That is more than double the next highest, the US, at six billion. But when you consider emissions per head of the population, the picture is reversed.  The US emitted 17.7 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per head in 2022, comfortably ahead of China, at 9.8 tonnes. (Actually, countries such as Qatar, which produce large amounts of oil and gas relative to their population size, are at the top of that list.) It is also worth considering historical emissions, as greenhouse gases (especially CO2) stay in the atmosphere for a long time.  Since 1850, the US also comes out on top – responsible for about 17.3% of warming – with China next on 12.7%. The UK is in eighth place on 2.4%. UK emissions of tiny health-harming airborne particles have fallen considerably since the 1970s. But improvements have slowed over the last decade, despite reductions from cars and other sources. The recent increase in wood burning in homes and industry is a key factor in this, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Wood-burning stoves generate much higher levels of particle pollution than a gas boiler or electric heat pump. As wood burns, it releases tiny particles which can stay in the atmosphere for a few days and drift in the wind. This means that wood burning can affect outdoor air quality over large areas. Wood-burning stoves can also worsen air quality within the home, particularly when the stove door is opened. The particle pollution from any given stove can vary significantly though, depending on its design and how it is used. Wet wood is much more polluting than dry wood, for example. Aviation is responsible for roughly 4% of all human-caused warming. Perhaps the most obvious effect on the climate is that burning jet fuel releases planet-warming gases like CO2. Flying generally emits much more CO2 per passenger than train travel, for example. A large proportion of warming from aviation actually comes from the effects of contrails. These are the wispy white lines you might see left behind a plane in the sky, formed as water vapour from jet engines condenses and freezes. There is an aspirational global target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 2050.  But reducing the climate impact of flying is going to be very difficult. There are currently no widely available alternatives to traditional jet fuels. Aviation groups hope that new, cleaner technologies will come good. But many scientists warn that flying less is the only sure-fire way to get emissions down. Electric vehicle (EV) sales are currently far ahead of hydrogen-powered vehicles. In 2023, around 9.5 million battery electric cars were sold worldwide. The number of hydrogen-powered cars sold was around 1,000 times smaller, and actually fell compared with 2022. Not only are hydrogen cars very expensive, the infrastructure is also lacking. The hydrogen economy is in its very early stages – and most hydrogen production currently comes from fossil fuels, so is not “clean”. While there are clearly challenges of upgrading the electricity grid to cope with demand of EVs – and installing charging points – this is seen as much more realistic, at least in the short-term. Hydrogen might have a role to play in future, for example in heavy-duty vehicles. But the current evidence strongly suggests that EVs will play the main role in decarbonising transport. As for the question about fires, the UK government says there “is no evidence to suggest that fires in EVs are more likely to occur than in petrol or diesel vehicles”. It also says that while “EVs tend to be heavier than equivalent petrol or diesel vehicles, on average passenger cars have been increasing in weight for many years” and that many petrol and diesel cars “are as heavy as EVs”. World population is not as important for global warming as it might initially appear. The real key is the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per person, which varies hugely around the world. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is a region with one of the fastest growing populations - but makes a very small contribution to climate change compared with richer countries like the United States. The disparity in carbon emissions was highlighted by UN Secretary General António Guterres in a major speech earlier this year. “The richest 1% emit as much as [the poorest] two-thirds of humanity,” he said. So tackling high levels of carbon consumption would make a big difference - while still allowing poorer countries to develop and meet their needs. It could mean that global emissions start to fall, even with the world’s population still rising."

Kingsbridge Community College pupil Anna Petrenko came to the UK in spring 2022 after the war between Ukraine and Russia started when the latter's troops invaded their neighbouring nation. She was among the thousands of pupils across Devon and the UK who have discovered their A or T-level results in person or by email. Miss Petrenko achieved two A*s and an A in her A-levels and is heading to the University of Bristol to study physics. Miss Petrenko, who studied A-levels in physics, further maths and computer science, said moving to the town was ""definitely different"" to where she lived in Ukraine. However, she said the last two years have been an enjoyable experience for her. ""In Ukraine, I lived in a big city, so this rural town has definitely been a change, but I do love it,"" Miss Petrenko said. ""It was hard work to get the results I got, but I enjoyed it."" As results were opened, Miss Petrenko's head teacher urged people to have faith in the exam system as top A-level grades returned to pre-Covid levels. Figures from the Joint Council for Qualifications said the percentage of A* or A grades achieved across England, Wales and Northern Ireland rose to 27.8% - which is up from 27.2% last year and 25.4% in 2019. Tina Graham, principal at Kingsbridge Community College, said pupils had done themselves proud during some tough times. The Covid pandemic caused exams to be cancelled in 2020 and 2021, with results being based on teachers' assessments. This led to levels for the top two marks hitting 38.5% in 2020, 44.7% in 2021 and dropping to 36.4% in 2022. Ms Graham said she was delighted with how the pupils at Kingsbridge Community College had performed in this year's exams. She added the impact of Covid on the education system might still be being felt, but there are a lot of positive signs from the latest results. ""What's really important is for parents and students and teachers to have faith in that exam system,"" Ms Graham said. ""It is really important that we are making that move back to pre-Covid times."" Milo Clover, 18, who got an A* in biology and A grades in chemistry, computer science and physics, said: ""It is two years of hard work and stress that has finally paid off."" T-level results were also collected by pupils in Devon three years after the qualification, which is the equivalent of three A-levels, was introduced in England. T-levels were developed alongside employers to help people learn skills which meet the needs of their industry. City College Plymouth said it achieved an overall pass rate of 99% from its 900 students in subjects including engineering, sports and childcare. The college said it was investing £2.5m in T-level building developments during the summer and was proud of the marks its students had scored.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78l44xvy1mo,Malawi ex-president plots comeback in next election,Peter Mutharika is picked to run in next year's presidential election by the main opposition DPP.,19 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:48.532894,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Malawi's former president, Peter Mutharika, has been chosen to lead the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) into next year's presidential election. It marks a comeback for the 84-year-old, who governed Malawi for six years and later suggested he would not run for office again. He surprised many with a change of heart, saying recently that his supporters want him to save the country from being ruined by President Lazarus Chakwera. Mr Mutharika lost to Mr Chakwera in 2020, in a re-run that was ordered by the country's Constitutional Court after it annulled the previous year's election. Judges had ruled that there was widespread tampering in the 2019 vote, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on ballot papers, and that Mr Mutharika's declared victory in that poll was void. Malawi's judiciary were praised for their bravery in refusing to accept a second-rate election, and the political fallout in the former president's party has been ugly. Following a period of internal squabbling, the DPP has expelled several members including those who wanted to challenge Mr Mutharika for the party presidency, paving the way for him to be re-elected party leader unopposed. Monday's announcement that he had won the official endorsement of his party as its presidential candidate was largely a formality. This means Mr Mutharika and Mr Chakwera will square off against each other at the polls for the third time, each having won and lost once in the past. Mr Mutharika told party supporters he was ready to regain power ""to remove an incompetent government which sees nothing, hears nothing and does nothing"". He appears to enjoy the solid support of his party, but critics say it should have identified a younger, more energetic leader as its torchbearer in next year’s polls. His rival, the incumbent Mr Chakwera, is 15 years his junior. President Chakwera came into office promising ""to clear the rubble of corruption"", to create a million jobs for the unemployed youth and to ensure food security so that all Malawians have three meals a day. His government admits it has found it hard to deliver on those campaign promises, but blames that on Covid-19 at the start of its term of office, natural disasters such as cyclones and the economic downturn caused by the war in Ukraine. Government officials, including Information Minister Moses Kunkuyu, have repeatedly said, even with these difficulties, the present administration has outperformed its predecessors by creating systems that make it hard for corruption to flourish. Successes include the reintroduction of train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades, helping to reduce the cost of transporting goods. Major road construction is also under way, particularly in the capital, Lilongwe. The ruling Malawi Congress Party (MCP) will have to defend that record at the polls, and could yet make age a key campaign issue - questioning whether former President Mutharika has both the physical strength and mental capacity to govern once more.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9rygl5k4jo,US-Russian woman jailed for 12 years for $51 charity gift,Ksenia Karelina was found guilty of treason in Russia for donating to a charity supporting Ukraine.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:54.260257,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Russian court has sentenced amateur ballerina Ksenia Karelina to 12 years in jail for treason for donating $51 (£39) to a charity supporting Ukraine. Karelina, who has American and Russian citizenship, pleaded guilty last week after a trial held behind closed doors. She had been living in Los Angeles and became a US citizen in 2021. She was arrested during a family visit last January in Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year jail term. The court in Yekaterinburg found her guilty of high treason and sentenced her to imprisonment in a general regime penal colony. Karelina had been accused by Russia's FSB security service of raising money for a Ukrainian organisation providing arms to the Ukrainian military.  Russian human rights activists said while living in the US she had made a single transfer of $51.80 on the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 22 February 2022. The FSB is thought to have discovered the transaction on her phone. Her lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, said Karelina had only admitted transferring the money and believed the funds would help victims on both sides. He told Russian media she would appeal against the sentence. The charity, Razom for Ukraine, said earlier this year it was ""appalled"" to hear of the amateur ballerina's arrest and denied raising money for weapons or ammunition. It said it was a US-founded charity focused on humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Karelina went on trial in June in the same court as Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was jailed for espionage but freed earlier this month as part of a major prisoner swap with the US and other Western countries. The cases in Yekaterinburg were heard by the same judge, Andrei Mineev. Ksenia Karelina's boyfriend, boxer Chris van Heerden, said on Thursday that he was very angry with the US State Department. ""I woke up to the news this morning. I'm still sitting here processing what's happening,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's media partner.  ""There was a prisoner swap two weeks ago, and Ksenia was not on that list,"" he said, adding that he had been pushing for her to be sent home for the past eight months. ""Ksenia should be home, and I'm angry, and I'm trying to hold my composure."" Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Mr Van Heerden said he felt Karelina should never have gone back to Russia at the start of the year. ""Now my question is, can we get Ksenia declared 'wrongly detained' today, so that when the next swap happens, she is part of it?"" If the US declares a person to be ""wrongfully detained"", it means it views them as a political hostage and negotiations are vital to securing their freedom. He added ""To my surprise, there were two people [in the prisoner swap] who were not declared 'wrongly detained' and they got out - so why is Ksenia not home?"" Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia's authorities have clamped down on dissent and human rights groups say more than 1,000 criminal cases have been opened against anti-war dissidents. Last year President Vladimir Putin signed a decree formally increasing the maximum jail term for treason from 20 years to life. A record number of treason cases were opened last year, according to human rights activists. In July, dual German-Russian teenager Kevin Lik was given four years for treason. He was one of the 16 men and women freed by Russia as part of its prisoner exchange with the West. When Karelina was first detained, rights group Perviy Otdel said she had been accused of swearing in a public place. But her initial detention for ""petty hooliganism"" was then extended when the FSB accused her of treason. She had been working at a hotel spa in Beverly Hills before her arrest and had travelled to Yekaterinburg to see her parents and her elderly grandmother. Karelina is her maiden name, and she is also known as Ksenia Khavana because she took her ex-husband's surname.  ""I want to break down and cry and yell and lose my head, but I know I have to stay strong - and I need to keep fighting,"" Mr Van Heerden told the BBC. He said he worried about the effect of Karelina's imprisonment on her health. ""She is a very soft person with a very kind heart and I'm afraid for her. I'm afraid that her kind heart will be stepped on and I know that she is fearful.  I know she wants to break down and cry, but she is pretending to be strong."" ""The fight doesn't end here,"" he added, ""the fight is now to get her back on US soil. Our only hope is the US government."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj627x96gxxo,"Advance into Russia continues, says Ukraine",President Volodymyr Zelensky says his troops have captured 100 Russian soldiers since the morning.,15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:54.361895,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine says its forces are continuing their advance into Russian territory, moving forward in several directions. Russia's western border region of Kursk came under a surprise attack last week, leading Russian authorities to declare a state of emergency in the area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had advanced 1-2 km further into Kursk since Wednesday morning, and had also captured 100 Russian soldiers. But Russia claims it has stopped any further advances. Now in its second week, this is Ukraine's deepest incursion into Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. The amount of Russian territory seized is uncertain, with both countries making conflicting statements. A commander of the Chechen Akhmat special forces unit, Maj-Gen Apti Alaudinov told viewers on Russian state-controlled TV, Channel One, that Russian forces had almost “completely blocked” the Ukrainian military from advancing. But in a video link to President Zelensky,  army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi stated Ukrainian troops were now fully in control of the Kursk border town of Sudzha.  The BBC is unable to independently verify this claim, but a Ukrainian television report filmed from within the town showed Ukrainian soldiers removing a Russian flag from a school. Amid Kyiv's claims of territorial gains, Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy said they were not interested in ""taking over"" Russian territory. ""The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defence forces into Russia will stop,"" he told reporters. In an earlier meeting with government officials, Mr Zelensky said he would consider setting up “military commandants' offices” in the region. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk outlined plans for a “security zone” in Kursk, to protect Ukraine’s borders. Her Telegram post said Ukraine would organise humanitarian aid for Russian civilians within the security zone, and open evacuation corridors to both Russia and Ukraine. Yan Furtsev, a local official with Russia's liberal opposition party, Yabloko, said the situation in the Kursk region was ""tense"". ""Citizens that are leaving their homes are in a very difficult psychological situation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, adding they were experiencing a lot of ""stress and sadness"".  Mr Furtsev said about 180,000 civilians needed to be evacuated. So far 121,000 had left, he said, with everyone needing basic essentials such as food and clothing. Earlier Russia declared a second state of emergency, this time in the neighbouring Belgorod region, where homes have been damaged in drone attacks and shelling. Moscow says that overnight it shot down 117 drones overnight, which mainly targeted four regions - Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod and Nizhny Novgorod.  Long-range drones were also fired at Russian airfields in Voronezh and Kursk, as well as Savasleyka and Borisoglebsk, Ukraine's security services told AFP. The Ukrainian military quoted a secret service source as calling it a ""fun"" night at the airports overnight, in what was a specially planned operation. In his first comments on the operation since it began, US President Joe Biden said that the offensive was “creating a real dilemma for Putin"". Meanwhile, various European allies have voiced their support for Ukraine. The prime ministers of Finland and Estonia said they supported Ukraine's military operation in Kursk, while Latvia’s foreign minister went a step further by saying Kyiv “has the right” to use Nato weapons on Russian territory. Russia's President Vladimir Putin had previously described this as a ""red line"". Last week, the German foreign ministry said Ukraine was entitled to self-defence which was ""not limited to its own territory""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qgwvjj9d1o,Ukraine sets up military office inside Russia,"The office has been created ""on the territories controlled by Ukraine"", says its top military chief.",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:54.464714,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine has set up a military administrative office in Russia's western Kursk region, where its surprise incursion into Russian territory continues, according to its top military commander. Gen Oleksandr Syrsky said the office would ""maintain law and order"" and ""meet the immediate needs"" of the population in the area. In a video posted on social media, Gen Syrsky is seen telling a meeting chaired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the office has been created ""on the territories controlled by Ukraine"". Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov has said Moscow will send reinforcements to ""safeguard"" the population in the region. Ukraine also claimed to have made further gains in its incursion on Thursday. Ukrainian troops were 35km inside the Kursk region, where they control 1,150sq km of territory, including 82 settlements, Gen Syrsky said.  Now on its 10th day, this is Ukraine's deepest incursion into Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. But Kyiv has said it is not interested in ""taking over"" Russian territory.  Instead, the incursion is an attempt to pressure Moscow into agreeing to ""restore a just peace"", Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy told reporters on Wednesday. In light of the incursion, Russian officials have prepared plans for ""additional measures"" to safeguard the population and infrastructure in areas bordering Ukraine. The measures involve improving the ""management of troops"" in the Belgorod region, which neighbours Kursk, according to a video published on the Russian defence ministry's Telegram channel. Interfax news agency said the plan would also apply to Kursk and Bryansk regions. All three border Ukraine. Russia has also declared a federal level emergency in the Belgorod region. On Monday, 11,000 people were evacuated from the Krasnaya Yaruga district in Belgorod, according to Russian state news agency Tass. Despite this, Moscow also claims it has recaptured some lost territory. In a statement, the defence ministry said it had regained control of the Krupets settlement in the Kursk region. The developments came as a UK source confirmed to the BBC that tanks donated by the UK had been used during Ukraine's Russian incursion.  The UK Ministry of Defence did not officially comment on which specific UK weapons have been used by Ukraine, but the department reiterated that Ukraine had a ""clear right"" to use UK-supplied weapons for ""self-defence against Russia's illegal attacks"".  The UK was one of the first countries to provide modern Western battle tanks to Ukraine, donating 14 Challenger 2 tanks in the past year.  But that was for a Ukrainian offensive to recapture its own territory.  The Ministry of Defence has insisted that there has been no change in policy.  Military equipment supplied by the United States and Germany is also being used for Ukraine's incursion. None of those countries have raised objections about their equipment being used for the offensive. But given the secrecy surrounding the operation, few would have known Ukraine's intentions in advance. There may still be concerns in the West about what happens next. Not just over whether Ukraine could suffer significant losses and come back asking for more. But more importantly, there will be some who may worry about how Russia responds. The Kremlin has already accused the West of being behind the attack on its territory. The fact that Western weapons are involved could be seen as evidence for that charge.  Escalation is always a worry when it involves a nuclear armed state, and the Kremlin has not been afraid to occasionally rattle its nuclear sabre.  But it has also set down many red lines that have already been crossed.  It warned the West not to supply Ukraine with tanks in the first place. That warning was eventually ignored. There is, however, still one big restriction. No Western country has given Kyiv the green light to use their long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia.  Britain, France and the US have all provided some – but with the caveat they must be used inside Ukraine, which does include its southern Crimea peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. President Zelensky has repeatedly pleaded for those caveats to be lifted. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/credw5q0705o,Rosenberg: Ukraine's advance undermines Putin's image as 'Mr Security',Ukraine's incursion into Kursk raises questions about Mr Putin's ability to keep Russia safe.,14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:54.558627,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Kursk. It is one of the first words I wrote and spoke as a BBC correspondent. In 2000, I reported on the sinking of the Kursk submarine in the icy waters of the Barents Sea. One hundred and eighteen submariners were killed. Vladimir Putin had been president for less than half a year. I can still remember Russian TV channels slamming him over his handling of the disaster. This week marked 24 years since K-141 Kursk sank. And, once again, the word Kursk is filling my despatches from Russia. This time Kursk Region, where Ukrainian troops launched their surprise incursion and where they have been seizing territory for nine days now. Same word. But Russia 2024 is very different from Russia 2000. This time on Russian TV there is no hint of criticism of President Putin; no casting doubt on his decision-making; no suggestion that it is his invasion of Ukraine that has led to this dramatic moment. Then again, the Kremlin has had a quarter of a century to establish tight control over the Russian media and the messaging. Even so, will these events damage Vladimir Putin? It’s a question I’ve been asked many times over the last two-and-a-half years: President Putin got through all of that, apparently unscathed. He will be confident he can overcome this latest challenge. But here’s the thing. The Wagner mutiny was over in a day.  Ukraine’s offensive inside Russia has been going on for more than a week. The longer it continues, the greater the pressure will be on the Russian leadership and, potentially, the greater the damage to President Putin’s authority. Through his two and a half decades in power, Mr Putin has cultivated the image of ""Mr Security"", the only man in this vast country capable of keeping Russians safe and secure.  His so-called ""special military operation"" (the full-scale invasion of Ukraine) was presented to the Russian people as a way of boosting Russia’s national security. Two and a half years into this war there isn’t much sign here of ""safe and secure"".  There is more Nato on Russia’s borders, with Sweden and Finland having joined the Nato Alliance; Russian towns are coming under regular Ukrainian drone attack; now Ukrainian soldiers are seizing Russian territory. Through his choice of language, Vladimir Putin is trying to show the Russian public that there is no need to panic.  When referring to the Ukrainian incursion he has avoided using the word ""invasion"". Instead, he has spoken of “the situation in the border area” or “the events that are taking place”. The Kremlin leader has also called the Ukrainian offensive “a provocation”. What will the Russian president do next? Don’t expect him to pick up the phone and call Kyiv. Russian officials have made it clear that, following the Ukrainian attack, they’re putting the very idea of peace talks on hold.  Not that any large-scale negotiation had been scheduled to take place. In fact, this week Vladimir Putin announced exactly what his intention is: “…to force the enemy from Russian territory.” It’s one thing saying it. It’s another thing doing it. Despite deploying reinforcements to the Kursk region, the Russian military has yet to regain control in this part of Russia. As I was walking past the Kremlin on Thursday morning, I stopped in my tracks. As workers were setting up seating and screens for an event, Edith Piaf’s classic Non, je ne regrette rien (No, I regret nothing) was playing on a large video screen and echoing across Red Square. It was a very surreal moment. Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of regret for having launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. No regret for the decisions he has taken since. If his public statements reflect his current state of mind, he still believes there is only one possible outcome of this war: Russia’s victory."

Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the situation was ""extremely difficult"" due to daily shelling in the region. ""Houses are destroyed, civilians died and were injured,"" he said. It follows Ukraine's surprise cross-border attack in Russia's Kursk region last week, leading to mass evacuations and a state of emergency being declared there by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a video on Telegram, Governor Gladkov said he would be appealing to the government to declare an emergency ""at the federal level"" like in Kursk. He said the city of Shebekino and the village of Ustinka had been attacked by Ukrainian drones. No casualties have been reported as of yet. Russia says it shot down 117 drones overnight, which mainly targeted four regions -  Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod and Nizhny Novgorod. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Mr Gladkov said there had been 23 drone attacks over the past 24 hours in Belgorod. Shelling and shrapnel had damaged a church, 14 houses, an administrative building, several vehicles and a gas supply line, he said. He added that one civilian had been wounded as a direct result of a drone attack in the urban Shebekinsky district.  Belgorod lies just south of the Kursk region, the location of Ukraine's deepest incursion into Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.  In a video on Telegram on Wednesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed troops had advanced 1-2km further into Kursk since the start of the day. But Moscow claims it has stopped Ukrainian forces from advancing further into the region. Exactly how much Russian territory has been seized is uncertain, and there is scepticism over army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi's previous claim that a total of 1,000 sq km was under Ukrainian control. In a social media post, President Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had captured 100 Russian prisoners of war on Wednesday. Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy has said Kyiv is not interested in ""taking over"" Russian territory.  ""The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defence forces into Russia will stop,"" he told reporters. President Putin claimed on Monday that Ukraine had refused Russian proposals to return to a peaceful settlement plan.  ""It appears that the enemy, with the help of his Western masters, is fulfilling their will, and the West is fighting us with the hands of the Ukrainians,"" he said. Russian's foreign ministry special envoy Rodion Miroshnik has described Ukraine's incursion as a ""terrorist action"", accusing Ukraine of putting the prospect of peace talks ""on a long pause"" by attacking the Kursk region.  President Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea which was annexed in 2014. Russia has so far struggled to halt the Ukrainian advance, with almost 200,000 Russians having fled their homes in parts of the Kursk region. In his first comments since the operation, US President Biden said that the offensive was “creating a real dilemma for Putin"". The prime ministers of Finland and Estonia, meanwhile, said they supported Ukraine's military operation in Kursk at a joint press conference on Wednesday.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzdww1p28o,Freed prisoner details time in 'harshest' Russian jail,"Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian writer and activist, was one of 24 prisoners released on 1 August.",15 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:54.758200,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Political prisoner Vladimir Kara-Murza is now free after spending over two years - 11 months of them in solitary confinement - in one of Russia's ""harshest prison regimes"".  He described his life in prison as ""endless, meaningless and exactly the same"", akin to the movie Groundhog Day.  ""Just a few weeks ago, I was absolutely certain I would die in Putin's gulag,"" he told the Washington Post on Wednesday.  Mr Kara-Murza, a Russian writer and activist, was one of 24 prisoners released on 1 August in the largest Russia-west prisoner exchange since the Cold War.  Mr Kara-Murza, who is also a British citizen, was arrested in 2022 for his strong opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. He was held in a facility in Omsk, which he described as one of the harshest prisons in the country.  His day started at 05:00 local time in a small cell about 2 by 3 meters (7 by 10 feet). Everything was scheduled - from his meals to his walks to when the lights would be turned off. Most of his day was spent staring at a wall.  ""You're just sitting in your cell essentially doing nothing,"" he said.  He was given a pen and paper and allowed to write for 90 minutes each day. “To somebody whose profession is writing as it is in my case, I have to say that’s a particularly sadistic rule,"" he said.  Mr Kara-Murza was kept in solitary confinement for 11 months. United Nations rules consider confinement to be torture if a person is held without human contact for more than 22 hours per day on at least 15 consecutive days.  He wasn't allowed to contact his family by telephone and only spoke with his wife once in the two years he was jailed. “It’s really not easy when you’re just completely deprived of any human contact,"" he said.  To pass the time, Mr Kara-Murza said he read as much as he could and learned Spanish.   He recalled that prisoners would be regularly asked to state their tentative release date as well as their names and cell numbers. His - which he will never forget - was 21 April 2047.  ""Frankly, it really gets to you,"" he said of the repeated demand.  Mr Kara-Murza said three factors kept him from giving up while in prison: His Christian faith, his background as a historian and knowing ""that he was right"". ""This knowledge is really important because I knew that I was right. I knew that the real criminals are those who are waging this aggressive and criminal war against Ukraine, not those of us who have publicly spoken out against it,"" he said.   He described the two weeks since his release as ""surreal"".  “What happened with us gives a lot of hope to so many others who are still languishing in Putin's gulag,"" he said. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c785n2n9334o,Six Kamala Harris claims fact-checked,"BBC Verify examined claims made by Harris, about her record and Trump's on the economy, abortion and immigration.",20 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:54.859808,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Kamala Harris has been holding rallies across the US as she campaigns against Donald Trump, and will appear in Milwaukee on Tuesday ahead of her headline speech at the Democratic National Convention later in the week. She has made a series of claims contrasting their records on the economy, healthcare, abortion and immigration. BBC Verify has been examining them.  CLAIM: “Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.” VERDICT: This is misleading. In this campaign, Trump has said repeatedly he would not do this, although he has suggested he would in the past. Social Security provides a source of income when you retire or if you cannot work due to a disability. Medicare is a US government programme which provides healthcare coverage for millions of Americans who are retired or disabled. “I will not cut 1 cent from Social Security or Medicare,” Trump said at a rally on 5 August. And in his 20 point policy platform, one of the pledges is: “Fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts.” However, during his time as president Trump proposed several budgets which would have cut elements of Medicare, such as eliminating the programme advising recipients how to sign up for benefits. None of these budget proposals was enacted. He also has made comments about cutting Social Security in the past. In an interview in March this year, on entitlement programs such as Social Security Trump said: ""There’s a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting."" However, he later clarified the comments, saying: “I will never do anything that will hurt or jeopardise Social Security or Medicare.” CLAIM: “Inflation is down under 3%.” VERDICT: That figure is correct but some context is needed here.  Inflation, which is the increase in the price of something over time, is down from a peak of 9.1% under the Biden administration and it is higher than when Mr Trump left office.  When President Biden took office in January 2021, inflation was 1.4% but it rose significantly during the first two years of his administration. This trend is comparable with many Western countries which saw high inflation in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues as a consequence of Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. While the Biden administration had limited control over these external factors, some economists say that their 2021 American Rescue Plan, worth $1.9tn (£1.5tn), also contributed to rising prices.  CLAIM: “We have created 16 million new jobs.” VERDICT: That is roughly correct. 15.8 million jobs have been added under the Biden administration, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, when the Biden government entered the White House in January 2021, the US was recovering from the Covid pandemic, which crippled the economy and during which more than 20 million jobs were lost. “Many of the jobs would have come back if Trump had won in 2020 - but the American Rescue Plan played a major role in the speed and aggressiveness of the labour market recovery,” says Professor Mark Strain, an economist at Georgetown University. Since President Biden came into office, job growth has been strong, surpassing the pre-pandemic levels seen under Trump. However, weaker than expected job growth in July led to fears of a sudden downturn in the US economy and stock markets were hit as a result, but they have since stabilised. CLAIM: “He froze in the face of the COVID crisis. He drove our economy into the ground.” VERDICT: The US economy did take a big hit during the pandemic, like most countries, but it also bounced back under Trump. You can see from the graph above that there was a dramatic collapse in economic growth in the US during the Covid pandemic. However following the pandemic, the US economy bounced back under Trump. He implemented a series of measures to help it recover, including financial assistance for small businesses. During Trump’s four years in office (Jan 2017- Jan 2021), the average annual growth rate of the US economy was 2.3%. Under the Biden administration, this figure has been 2.2% - so almost the same.  CLAIM: ""We had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades but Donald Trump tanked the deal."" VERDICT: Trump was publicly against the Biden administration's immigration bill, but voting on it was up to Congress. The immigration bill aimed to tighten asylum standards, increase spending on Border Patrol, and allow for the automatic closure of the southern border to illegal crossings if a certain daily threshold was reached. It failed to pass a vote in February with the majority of lawmakers in the US Senate opposing it. Trump did not have a vote as he was not an elected official at the time, but he did call for his Republican allies to oppose it. Trump also took credit when the bill failed, saying it was “horrendous” as he thought it was not tough enough on immigration. At a Fox News event in February 2024, he said he was against the deal as passing it would have “made it much better for the opposing side”. The bill was blocked in the Senate for a second time in May. CLAIM: “In more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest... be sure if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban"" VERDICT: Bans were enacted by states after Trump left office but, as president, he appointed three justices to the Supreme Court who voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Trump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban.  Roe v. Wade protected the federal Constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years until it was overturned in June 2022. As a result, 22 states currently ban abortion or restrict the procedure to earlier in pregnancy than was set by Roe v. Wade. In 14 of those states, abortion is banned in almost all circumstances with 10 not even making an exception for rape or incest. During his campaign, he has declined to back a national abortion ban and said he believes the issue should be left to individual states. Additional reporting by Gerry Georgieva.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx924r4d5yno,"Where Kamala Harris stands on 10 key issues, from immigration to guns",Some of the vice-president's views have changed since she first entered politics.,11 Sep 2024,2024-10-14 18:29:55.058977,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Vice-President Kamala Harris has been riding high on a wave of favourable polls and energetic rallies since she became the Democratic Party's nominee for president, and selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  She released a detailed policy guide in early September offering voters a sense of what a Harris-Walz administration might look like.  This focuses on her economic and foreign policy agenda, and highlights her most urgent priority to tackle the cost of living.  Here are her key policy pledges. As vice-president, she has been Mr Biden's partner in passing major economic legislation - regularly labelled ""Bidenomics"" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy. Growth and jobs creation have been strong but inflation and high interest rates continue to hit American wallets. In a convention acceptance speech focused on the economy, Ms Harris promised mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation. She said in her speech that her plans would create ""an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed"". In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN, Ms Harris said that ""one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class"", a theme that she has repeated on the campaign trail. Ms Harris's position on the border has changed over time to a more moderate one in this campaign. On the campaign trail, the vice-president has reiterated her continued support for the hardline bipartisan border security deal that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction.  It was torpedoed by congressional Republicans earlier this year at Trump's urging. It would have fast-tracked decisions on asylum cases, limited humanitarian parole, and expanded the authority to deport migrants. Part of her policy proposal is to revive the border security bill and sign it into law.  She has also said there ""should be consequences"" for people who cross the US border unlawfully, though she once held a much more lenient position. As vice-president, she was tasked with tackling the root causes of the record numbers of Central American migrants crossing the southern border. Those numbers spiked during the Biden administration, but have declined in recent months. She helped raise $3bn - largely from private companies - for regional investments in hopes it would encourage residents to remain in their home countries. Ms Harris has long supported women's right to an abortion. She has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide. “When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,” she said at a rally for her 2024 campaign in Atlanta, Georgia. She has reiterated that commitment several times, including during the ABC News debate with Donald Trump. In her policy proposal, Ms Harris wrote she would ""never allow a national abortion ban to become law"".  Ms Harris was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and she toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to address state abortion bans - often framing the issue as one about personal freedom. Ms Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since she was elected to the US Senate. As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries. She attended the Munich Security Conference in the past year, and delivered remarks in support of western security alliance Nato that denounced isolationism and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ms Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”, and represented the US at Kyiv's “peace conference” in Switzerland. In her speech at the Democratic convention, she noted that she met President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""warn him about Russia's plan to invade"" five days before Russia invaded, and ""helped mobilise a global response"" after the war began.  The vice-president also pledged, if elected, to ensure that ""America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century"" and to shoulder the responsibility of US leadership. Ms Harris has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution, and she has called for an end to the war in Gaza. In her convention acceptance speech, she pledged as president to ensure ""that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination"". While serving as vice-president, she was one of the first members of the administration to call for an ""immediate cease-fire"", raise concerns over the ""humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians"" and charge Israel with ending the conflict.  She raised these issues in what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July. She has not supported an arms embargo on Israel, however, as some on the US left have called for.  And when she debated with Trump, she said: ""I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people."" At the party convention, she said she would ""always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself"". In her CNN interview, Ms Harris indicated that she would focus on securing a ceasefire deal, which was President Biden's approach. In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes, co-sponsoring a bill with Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments. As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%. This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also supported, of an increase to 28%. A campaign official told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal of not raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (£310,000).  During her acceptance speech after being confirmed as the Democratic candidate, she said she would ""pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans"". At the time of the speech, the details of the tax cut were unclear.  The Harris campaign later filled in the detail, saying that through the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit more Americans will be able to keep more of their income.  Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 tax cut.  Ms Harris held fairly progressive views about health care earlier in her career. She supported expanding publicly-funded health-care programmes in the US that cover the elderly, youth with disabilities and poor.  This included backing Medicare-for-All, a progressive priority that would make all health care publicly funded. She later walked that position back. Her campaign told the BBC that she would not push for a single-payer system if elected to the White House.  While vice-president, the White House has had health care successes. It reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage. On the campaign trail, she has said that she wants to erase billions of dollars in medical debt for Americans and would work with states on the issue. Details of the plan remain thin, but when she was California's attorney general, Ms Harris often used anti-trust laws to keep insurers, hospitals and drug companies to address costs. Ms Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, then California's attorney general.  Her offices increased conviction rates, particularly of violent criminals, though that history led to criticism from the progressive left, which at times labelled her ""a cop"" - though the right has accused her of being soft on crime. Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. She made mention of his conviction and him being found liable for committing sexual abuse in her Democratic party conference acceptance speech. As a prosecutor, Ms Harris defended California's climate laws and sued oil companies for environmental damage. She also called for climate change policies via a ""Green New Deal"" during her 2020 presidential campaign - some of which has come to fruition under the current administration.  During a CNN town hall in 2019, she said that ""there is no question I'm in favour of banning fracking"", which is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock that can be damaging to the environment. But she has gone back on that stance. During the presidential debate, she said she cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act - which opened up new leases for fracking companies - in addition to funnelling hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programs.  ""My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil,"" she said. Ms Harris said she will protect public lands and public health, lower household energy costs and hold polluters accountable to secure clear air and water if elected in November, according to her policy platform.  Ms Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career, and she successfully defended California's gun laws when they faced legal challenges as the state's attorney general.  As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and earlier this year announced resources to support the implementation of red-flag laws, which are aimed at keeping firearms from those who may harm themselves and others.  She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programs.  Her policy platform includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as a requirement for universal background checks.  During the debate she noted that both she and her vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz are gun owners."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze5pkg5jwlo,"We entered easily, say Ukrainian troops involved in Russia incursion",Ukrainian troops who entered Russia's Kursk this past week say they took the Russians by surprise.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.430898,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"While “Z” might be Russia’s symbol of its invasion, a triangle represents Ukraine’s most audacious attempt to repel it. They are taped or painted on the sides of every supply truck, tank, or personnel carrier that heads towards the Russian border in the Sumy region. It's an offensive that has seized hundreds of square kilometres of Russian territory and palpably restored momentum and morale to Ukraine’s war effort. The Russian official in charge of the border region of Kursk has spoken of 28 settlements under Ukrainian control and almost 200,000 Russians have fled their homes. Tomash has just returned from Ukraine’s cross-border mission along with his comrade “Accord”, who nonchalantly says it was “cool”. Their drone unit had spent two days paving the way for the cross border incursion. “We had orders to come here, but we didn’t know what that meant,” Tomash admits as he pauses for a coffee at a petrol station. “We suppressed the enemy’s means of communication and surveillance in advance to clear the way.”  Exactly how much Russian territory has been seized is uncertain, although there is scepticism over Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi’s claim that 1,000 sq km is under Ukrainian control. Russia’s defence ministry insisted on Tuesday that Ukrainian attempts to push deeper had been thwarted but they have been proved wrong before. Whatever the reality, it appears Kyiv is committed to this military gamble. The level of activity in the neighbouring Sumy region is something I haven’t seen since the liberations of 2022, when there was a feeling of wind in Ukrainian sails. It’s undoubtedly a welcome departure from the grinding war of attrition of the last 18 months, but to label it a success or failure would be premature. The goal of this offensive is unclear, although President Volodymyr Zelensky has spoken of targeting sites from which Russia can launch attacks on Ukraine and bringing “a just peace” closer. But it is evident Kyiv is deploying some of its best troops. Fit-looking soldiers gather around vehicles that match their muscularity. Most politely decline to talk. Some look exhausted. Over the Telegram messaging app, a soldier still in Russia tells us months of planning went into forcing Moscow to move troops from other parts of the front line in Ukraine. “The element of surprise worked,” he says. “We entered easily with little resistance. On 6 August, the first groups crossed at night in several directions.” “Almost immediately they reached the western outskirts of the city of Sudzha,” he adds. With operations like this, secrecy suits the soldiers carrying them out. The same cannot be said for civilians. On both sides of the border, tens of thousands are being evacuated after an increase in air strikes and fighting. “The Russian civilians we encounter don’t resist,” explains the soldier. “We don’t touch them, but they either treat us sharply, negatively, or not at all.” “They also deceive us about the positions of Russian troops,” he adds. The soldiers we speak to confirm that Russian forces have indeed been redeployed from the eastern front line, including the Kharkiv, Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions. But none of them are reporting a slowing of Russian advances, yet. Vladimir Putin has promised a “worthy response” to the first capture of Russian territory since World War Two. But any fear he intended to spread has not reached the dusty border settlements habitually bombed by his forces. Misha and his friend Valera pass us in their orange Lada in the village of Stetskivka. “I want them to take it [Kursk region] and do this!” says Misha, making a twisting gesture with his hands. “They should take everything, even Moscow!” It’s an anger anchored in being on the receiving end of Russia’s relentless full-scale invasion which began in February 2022. “Russia attacked first, not us,” chimes in Valera with his window down. “Now our guys have responded and shown what we’re capable of. We’d have captured it earlier if we’d had permission.” Ukraine, it seems, finally has the Western green light it had been yearning for to strike across the border. The stakes are still dauntingly high, as illustrated by new defences being built on the outskirts of Sumy city. Until last week, the area had been fearing a Russian offensive in Ukraine’s north. If Ukraine’s incursion fails, those worries could be realised quickly. Ukrainian forces were, and still are, outnumbered by the Russian aggressors. “For us to keep hold of this Russian territory we need two things,” writes our Ukrainian soldier on enemy soil. “More towns like Sudzha under our control, and reserves,” he says. “Our front line is already bursting at the seams, and it’s not clear where we will get them.” For Kyiv, the logic or hope is that Russia is forced to switch focus from fighting on Ukrainian soil to its own. Some in Ukraine believe this counter-offensive could even boost its position in any future peace negotiations. It could equally push talks even further away.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrjn828rq2o,"This is Ukraine's boldest and riskiest move this year, where does it go next?",Kyiv needs to decide whether to keep its forces in Russia to exert maximum pressure on Moscow or withdraw now.,13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.508990,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry has announced it has no intention of permanently holding on to the small pocket of Russian territory it has seized over the last week.  But it still faces a stark choice today - whether to keep its forces there to exert maximum pressure on Moscow or to withdraw now. Battered daily by Russia’s drones, missiles and glide bombs, its exhausted front-line forces falling slowly back in the Donbas, Ukraine was in dire need of some good news this summer.  With this extraordinarily bold and well-executed incursion into Russia’s Kursk oblast, it got it. ""The most striking thing about this incursion,"" said a senior British military source who asked not to be named, ""is how well the Ukrainians mastered combined arms warfare, deploying everything from air defence to electronic warfare as well as armour and infantry. It’s impressive."" The Ukrainians also appear to have used some of the modern Western-supplied weaponry - like the German Marder and other armoured vehicles - rather more effectively than they did in last year’s failed summer offensive to push the Russian army out of Ukraine’s south-eastern provinces. So where does Ukraine’s foray into Russia go from here? There will be those on the more cautious end of the spectrum who will argue that Ukraine has already made its point, that Putin’s war of choice must now bring some pain to Russians, that despite recent setbacks on the battlefield in the Donbas, Ukraine has shown itself capable of mounting a sophisticated, combined arms assault using all the elements of modern warfare. In other words, withdraw now with honour, having given the Kremlin a bloody nose, before Russia brings in enough forces to kill or capture the invading Ukrainians. But withdrawal would negate two of the apparent objectives of Ukraine’s incursion, namely to put enough pressure on Russia that it is forced to divert some of its own troops in the Donbas and secondly to hold enough Russian territory to use as a bargaining chip in any future peace negotiations. ""If Kyiv holds Russian territory,"" says Exeter University’s Dr David Blagden, ""it can bargain for the return of its own territory from a position of greater strength. Kyiv will have also sought to damage the impression of the all-powerful Putin regime among Russians and to encourage the Kremlin to seek a settlement lest they jeopardise their hold on power."" One thing is clear. The presence on Russian soil of foreign forces from Ukraine - a country that President Putin does not even think should exist as an independent nation - is intolerable.  He will throw everything he can at this problem while simultaneously keeping up the pressure on Ukraine in the Donbas and punishing its people with yet more drone and missile strikes.  His irritation was plain to see in Russian TV footage of him chairing an emergency meeting in Moscow yesterday. So has Ukraine’s gamble paid off? It is still too early to say. If its forces stay in place inside Russia’s borders they can expect to come under an ever-increasing ferocity of attacks as Moscow’s reaction creaks into gear.  Dr Blagden warns that ""the personnel, equipment and logistics demands of attempting to sustain the incursion then hold the taken territory will be significant, especially as supply lines lengthen."" This has undoubtedly been Ukraine’s boldest move this year. It has also been its riskiest."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lmr29ygjo,"Ukraine claims to control 1,000 sq km of Russian territory","Russian leader Vladimir Putin has described the cross-border offensive as a ""major provocation"".",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.587096,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine's top commander has said Kyiv's forces control 1,000 sq km of Russian territory as they press their biggest cross-border incursion in two-and-a-half years of full-scale war. Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukraine continued to ""conduct an offensive operation in the Kursk region"" seven days after it began. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had brought war to others and now it was coming back to Russia. But Russian leader Vladimir Putin described the offensive as a ""major provocation"" and ordered Russian forces to ""to kick the enemy out of our territory"". A growing number of people have been evacuated from the western Russian region for their safety, with a further 59,000 told to leave. The acting governor of Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said during a meeting with President Putin that 28 villages in the area had fallen to Ukrainian forces, that 12 civilians had been killed and that ""the situation remains difficult"". Ukrainian troops launched their surprise attack last Tuesday, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into Russia.  There was some scepticism at the Ukrainian commander-in-chief's assertion that his forces now controlled as much as 1,000 sq km of Russian territory. The US-based Institute for the Study of War think tank did not believe all the area was under Ukrainian control. Alexei Smirnov said the Ukrainians told the Russian leader that the Ukrainians had advanced 12km into Russian territory and that the width of the push was 40km. The offensive is said to have boosted morale on the Ukrainian side, but analysts say the strategy brings fresh dangers to Ukraine. A senior British military source, who asked not to be named, told the BBC there was the risk that Moscow will be so angered by this incursion that it could redouble its own attacks on Ukraine’s civilian population and infrastructure. In comments aired on state television, President Putin said on Monday: ""One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society. ""The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories,"" he told a meeting of officials. Mr Smirnov said 121,000 people had been evacuated from their homes. He told Mr Putin that about 2,000 Russian citizens remained in areas occupied by Ukrainian forces in the area. ""We don't know anything about their fate,"" he said. He warned people to take shelter from missiles in rooms without windows and with solid walls. In Belgorod, the region next to Kursk, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Tuesday that 11,000 people had left the Krasnoyarsk district closest to the border. He earlier warned that the entire region was on missile alert and told people to shelter in their basements. In his nightly address, Ukraine's president acknowledged the offensive, saying: ""Russia must be forced to make peace if Putin wants to fight so badly."" ""Russia brought war to others, now it's coming home. Ukraine has always wanted only peace, and we will certainly ensure peace,"" Mr Zelensky added. Ukrainian officials have said thousands of troops are engaged in the operation, far more than the small incursion initially reported by Russian border guards. An official told news agency AFP that their aim was ""to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia"". Speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme, Kurt Volker, a former US Ambassador to Nato, said Ukraine's incursion could cost President Putin politically at home. He said Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory had happened ""because of President Putin and the way he's conducted this war."" ""That is not going to be lost on the elites in Russia. It's not going to be lost on the public. Putin has provoked attacks on the Russian territory itself and people are having to be evacuated. That's quite something."" During a meeting with Mr Zelensky in Kyiv on Monday, US Senator Lindsey Graham called the cross-border operation ""brilliant"" and ""bold"", and urged the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs.  Some in Russia have questioned how Ukraine was able to enter the Kursk region - with one pro-Russian war blogger, Yuri Podolyaka calling the situation ""alarming"". Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a tough response from Russia's armed forces ""will not take long"". Russian ally Belarus said it was bolstering its own troop numbers at its border after claiming Ukraine had entered its airspace with drones. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency said late on Monday it had inspected a damaged cooling tower at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine following a fire on Sunday, but could not immediately find the cause.  Mr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately starting the fire in order to ""blackmail"" Ukraine, while Zaporizhzhia's Kremlin-installed regional governor has said it was caused by Ukrainian shelling.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4y3529v7vo,Steve Rosenberg: Ukraine's incursion shows Russia's war is not going to plan,The attack on Kursk has led some Russians to call for a deeper military push into Ukraine.,8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.680825,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was conceived in the Kremlin as a short, sharp military operation.  The expectation was that it would take a matter of days, a few weeks maximum, for Russia to establish control over its neighbour. That was nearly two-and-a-half years ago. The war in Ukraine rages on. It has not gone at all as Moscow had intended. But here’s the thing. Over the last 29 months, so often we’ve heard senior Russian officials claiming that the operation is going “according to plan.” President Vladimir Putin last said that in May, despite everything that had happened in the preceding two years: the heavy Russian casualties on the battlefield, the destruction of multiple Russian warships in the Black Sea, drone attacks deep inside Russia (even on the Kremlin itself), the shelling of Russian towns and villages near the Ukrainian border, the mutiny by Wagner mercenary fighters who had marched on Moscow. Now there is a new addition to the list: this week’s cross-border Ukrainian assault on Russia’s Kursk region. First, a disclaimer: it’s difficult to know exactly what is happening right now in the Sudzha district of Kursk region. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops are there, how much territory they have seized and what their final objective may be. Today’s edition of the Russian broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta declared: “Events on the Kursk front are shrouded in the notorious fog of war.” But even in fog, some things are clear. It’s evident that what is unfolding in Kursk region is further evidence that Russia’s war in Ukraine has not gone ""according to plan"". Events appear to have taken Russia’s political and military leadership completely by surprise. Don’t expect Moscow to admit that. More likely, Russian officials will use the Ukrainian assault to try to rally the Russian public around the government and bolster the official Kremlin narrative that (a) in this conflict Russia is not the aggressor, and (b) Russia is a besieged fortress surrounded by enemies who are plotting to invade and destroy it. In reality it was Russia that launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour. There’s clearly a big difference in language. When Russia poured its troops across the border into Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin called this a ""special military operation"" and claimed that Russia was “liberating” towns and villages. Moscow has described Ukrainian troops pushing into Russia as “a terrorist attack” and “a provocation.” The assault by Ukrainian forces on Kursk region and the fierce fighting there are a sign that hostilities are coming closer to home. But will that turn Russian public opinion against the war? Not necessarily. Last year I visited Belgorod, a Russian region which, like Kursk, borders Ukraine. It was being shelled from across the border. Everyone I met told me that nothing like this had happened before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine: before February 2022 it was all peace and quiet in Belgorod region.  But instead of concluding that the ""special military operation"" had been a mistake, most people I spoke to called for Russia to step up its military action and push deeper into Ukrainian territory. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is calling for exactly that. In a social media post today he wrote: “We can and we should take more land of the Ukraine that still exists. [We should go to] Odesa, to Kharkiv, to Dnipro, Mykolaiv. To Kyiv and onwards.” But Dmitry Medvedev doesn’t get to call the shots. Vladimir Putin does. We wait to see how he responds to what have been a dramatic few days in southern Russia."

Some 11,000 people in the Belgorod region have been moved, Russian state media reported, because of ""enemy action"" near the border. Belgorod lies next to Kursk - where Ukrainian troops launched their surprise attack into Russian territory last Tuesday.  Ukrainian forces have since advanced up to 18 miles (30km) inside Russia - the deepest incursion into the country since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv claims thousands of troops are involved. On Monday morning, residents in parts of Belgorod - which lies to the south of Kursk - were told not to panic but that they must evacuate. Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said people from Krasnaya Yaruga district were being moved due to ""enemy activity on the border"". He also said the whole region was under a missile alert, and told people to shelter in their basements. But he added he was ""sure that our servicemen will do everything to cope with the threat that has arisen"". People were also continuing to be evacuated from Kursk on Monday - with thousands of people told to leave their homes in the Belovsky district. Governor Alexei Smirnov also issued a missile warning - saying people needed to take shelter in rooms without windows and with solid walls. Temporary accommodation has been prepared, he said.  At the weekend, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine was taking the war into ""the aggressor's territory"". He acknowledged the attack for the first time on Saturday night - saying Russia had launched 2,000 attacks from Kursk this summer and it deserved a response. A senior Ukrainian official told the AFP news agency that thousands of troops were engaged in the operation, far more than the small incursion initially reported by Russian border guards. The official added that their aim was ""to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia"". Video from social media and verified by Reuters showed Ukrainian soldiers raising their flag in the Russian village of Guevo, in Kursk. It marks the biggest co-ordinated attack on Russian territory by Kyiv's conventional forces. Russia has so far struggled to halt the Ukrainian advance, with more than 76,000 people evacuated from the Kursk region, where a state of emergency has been declared by local authorities. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin described the offensive as a ""major provocation"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nel8eledo,"'I don't live, I just exist': Ukrainian families torn apart by visa changes",The government is facing calls to reverse changes making it harder for Ukrainians to bring family to the UK.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.836997,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The government is facing calls to reverse changes which make it harder for Ukrainians to bring family to the UK. One charity supporting migrants says the ""heartless"" policy has ""torn apart"" families and left people in danger. When Halyna Khovaiko first moved to the UK in December 2021 for work she had only been planning to stay for a few months.  After the factory she worked at in eastern Ukraine closed down she managed to get a seasonal job on a farm in the UK and left her son Ihnat, who was then 12 years old, with his grandparents in Vovchansk. But in February 2022 Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Vovchansk - which is just 5km from the Russian border - was occupied and Halyna was suddenly unable to return.  ""I have a very strong bond with my son,"" she says, speaking through a translator. ""Of course I miss him. It feels like you are more dead than alive. ""Just going to work and that's it. You exist but you don't live."" After the town was liberated by the Ukrainian army in the autumn of 2022 Halyna - a single mother - was able to see her son again. However, struggling to earn money to support her family she eventually decided to return to the UK for work.  Her plan was to rent a flat so she could move out of the farm caravan where she was staying and her son could join her. In January she finally managed to find somewhere to live in Weston-super-Mare and began the process of applying for a visa for her son under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  The scheme, launched in March 2022, allows people in the UK to host those fleeing the war in Ukraine.  However, in February - without notice - the government suddenly restricted eligibility so only British or Irish citizens or those with the right to live in the UK permanently could act as sponsors.  This meant Ukrainians living in the UK without permanent residence - including Halyna - could no longer sponsor family members to join them in the UK. At the same time the Ukraine Family Scheme, which allowed Ukrainians to join family members who already had permanent residence in the UK, was also closed.  Back in Vovchansk Russian attacks had intensified and the town was destroyed by shelling. Halyna's son, now 14, was forced to flee with his grandparents to the city of Kharkiv, 70km away. For Halyna, knowing her son is in danger is almost unbearable. ""There are explosions [where he is] every day,"" she says. ""You go to sleep and you don't know if you're going to wake up in the morning."" Work Rights Centre, a charity supporting migrants, says it has heard from nearly 200 Ukrainians who are separated from family members and trying to bring them to the UK.  Chief executive Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol says the current policy is ""heartless"" and has ""torn apart"" families.  ""We have seen parents spend months fighting for a way to bring their child to the UK,"" she says.  ""Others have tragically endured the death of a family member in Ukraine while they were searching for a sponsor to bring them to the UK."" The charity is calling on the new government to reverse the changes brought in by its predecessors so Ukrainians without the right to live in the UK permanently can still act as sponsors and reunite their families. When it was in opposition Labour said the changes sent ""the wrong message to the people of Ukraine about our willingness to stand with them"".  With the party now in government, the Home Office says the schemes are kept ""under continual review"".  Nadiia Yashan, an immigration advisor for Work Rights Centre who is from Ukraine herself, says the changes were a huge shock.  When they were announced, she says some of her clients were in the middle of applications or about to sign leases on a flat where they had hoped their family would be able to come and live.  Like the Ukrainians she works with, Nadiia says she was ""devastated"" by the news as she had hoped to bring her own mother to the UK if the situation in Ukraine worsened.  As she came to the UK on a student visa, with her right to stay extended because of the war, Nadiia does not have the right to live in the UK permanently so could no longer act as a sponsor for her mother.  ""I feel guilty, because maybe I should have [applied for her to come to the UK] sooner,"" she says.  ""I'm very, very concerned, and I'm thinking every day, what if it gets worse, and I need her to be here immediately and I can't do anything?"" Since the Russian invasion more than 180,000 people have come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  The number of applications has fallen since the outbreak of the war. But Work Rights Centre says there is still substantial demand as it is common for one parent to come to the UK first to find a job and house before bringing over the rest of their family. The charity says many Ukrainians in the UK are now struggling to find British sponsors for visa applications, with less people willing to host Ukrainians than when the war broke out.  When the changes to the scheme were announced, the previous government said they were to ensure people had appropriate accommodation and support in the UK, as the suitability of homes are checked under the scheme.  However, the charity says the current situation has the bizarre effect that a stranger could theoretically sponsor a Ukrainian child to come to the UK but their own parent could not.  Halyna, who speaks limited English, says it has been extremely difficult to find someone British to sponsor her child and people have struggled to understand why she needs a sponsor when she already has the right to live in the UK herself.  Despite settling into the UK with a job and home, she is now considering moving to a different country where it would be easier for her son to join her. ""This is not a life because my child is there, and I’m here,"" she says. ""I just want to be together with my child."""

""I felt Dynamo were a bit better than Rangers and they were devastated by the draw, but ultimately it doesnât make a great deal of difference to them,"" said Mikhailitchenko. ""Dynamo have an advantage coming to Scotland in that the atmosphere at Hampden is completely different to playing at Ibrox.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984l87l2w6o,Ukraine and Russia trade blame over fire at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant,Both sides say there has been no detected radiation spike at the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:07.993209,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other after a fire broke out at the giant Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Sunday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had started a fire at the plant, which has been occupied by Moscow's forces for more than two years. Zaporizhzhia's Kremlin-installed governor said Ukrainian shelling caused the blaze. The UN's nuclear watchdog said it saw ""strong dark smoke"" coming from the facility - but said there was ""no impact reported"" for nuclear safety. The development comes as Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 30km inside Russia, in the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022. On Sunday, Yevgeny Balitsky, the Kremlin-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia, said a fire had broken out at the cooling towers of the power plant. He blamed Ukrainian shelling, but asked for ""calm"", adding that there had been no radiation spike around the plant. Mr Zelensky also said there was no detected radiation spike or danger of a nuclear leak - but accused Russia of purposefully starting the fire in an attempt to ""blackmail"" Kyiv. In the early hours of Monday, Vladimir Rogov, another Kremlin-installed official, said the fire had been ""completely extinguished"" in a Telegram post. The nuclear power plant has been under the control of Russian troops and officials since 2022. It has not produced power in more than two years and all six reactors have been in cold shutdown since April.  In a statement posted on X, UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its experts had witnessed ""strong dark smoke"" coming from the plant following ""multiple explosions"". It said the plant had reported ""an alleged drone attack"" on one of the cooling towers at the site. ""No impact has been reported for nuclear safety,"" the IAEA added. In a later statement, the IAEA said it had requested ""immediate access to the cooling tower to assess the damage"". The fire comes just a day after President Zelensky acknowledged for the first time that his military is conducting a cross-border offensive inside Russia's western Kursk region. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine's military was pushing the war onto ""the aggressor's territory"". A senior Ukrainian official told the AFP news agency that thousands of troops were engaged in the operation, far more than initially reported by Russian border guards. Kyiv launched its surprise attack on Tuesday, rapidly advancing more than 30km (19 miles) inside Russia - the deepest raid since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has so far struggled to halt the Ukrainian advance, with more than 76,000 people evacuated from the Kursk region, where a state of emergency has been declared by local authorities. Emergency trains from Kursk to Moscow have also been set up by Russia's rail operator for those looking to flee. The fighting appeared to be ongoing over the weekend, with Kursk Governor Aleksei Smirnov saying early on Sunday that there were injured people in a ""treacherous"" Ukrainian attack. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the offensive was a ""major provocation"". "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79w810e38no,US soldier pleads guilty to selling secrets to China,"Sgt Korbein Schultz was allegedly paid $42,000 in exchange for dozens of sensitive security data.",14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:08.071331,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A US Army analyst has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to sell military secrets to China, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has said. Sgt Korbein Schultz was arrested in March after an investigation by the FBI and US Army counterintelligence alleged that he was paid $42,000 (£33,000) in exchange for dozens of sensitive security records. The criminal conspiracy began in June 2022 and continued up until his arrest, officials said. He is scheduled for sentencing in January. Sgt Schultz, who held a security clearance to access top secret information, conspired to collect data with someone whom he believed to be living in Hong Kong, according to court documents. The purported Hong Kong resident asked Sgt Schultz to collect sensitive data related to missile defence and mobile artillery systems, according to court records. Sgt Schultz also collected data on US fighter aircraft, military tactics, and the US military's defence strategy for Taiwan, based on what it learned from Russia's war in Ukraine. “By conspiring to transmit national defence information to a person living outside the United States, this defendant callously put our national security at risk to cash in on the trust our military placed in him,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the DOJ's National Security Division said. Sgt Schultz on Tuesday pleaded guilty to all charges against him, including conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information and bribery of a public official. The indictment against Sgt Schultz earlier detailed messages he sent to the supposed Hong Kong resident, who was referred to in court documents as Conspirator A. In one exchange, Sgt Schultz said he ""wished he could be Jason Bourne"" in reference to the fictional spy character. After being promised more money from his handler, he said in another message: ""I hope so! I need to get my other BMW back!"". The FBI and US Army Counterintelligence Command are continuing investigations into the case."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l1jxewwepo,US man held in Moscow for attacking police - local media,"A criminal case has been opened against the man, who could face up to five years in prison.",14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:15.678042,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A US citizen has been detained in Russia for alleged violence against a police officer, local media report. The man was arrested in a Moscow hotel on the night of 12 August after refusing to ""provide identification documents"", news agency Interfax said on Wednesday, citing Russia's Investigative Committee. A criminal case has been opened against him, and he could face up to five years in prison. The number of criminal cases launched against US citizens in Russia has increased significantly in recent years. Some of them, including US reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan, were freed in early August in the largest prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since the Cold War, when where 24 people jailed in seven different countries were exchanged. The latest US citizen to be arrested was ""behaving aggressively, using foul language” and was taken to a police station “because of his hooligan actions”, Moscow Region interior ministry spokesman Vladimir Vasenin said. According to local media, the incident took place at the Radisson hotel in Moscow. Officials said the man, who was not named in the report, would be charged and investigators would ask a court that he should be kept in custody. The US state department said on Wednesday it was aware of ""another American citizen being arrested in Russia, and we're working to get as much information as we can"". According to a spokesperson, the department has ""no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas"". Several US citizens and other Western nationals remain in Russian prisons on a variety of charges. Among them is Ksenia Karelina, a 32-year-old amateur ballerina and spa employee based in California. Ms Karelina - a dual citizen who was visiting family members in the country - was arrested on treason charges, to which she pleaded guilty. Security services accused Ms Karelina of collecting money that was used to purchase tactical supplies for the Ukrainian army. Another US citizen, Marc Fogel, is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence in Russia. Mr Fogel, a teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow, was arrested at an airport in August 2021 and charged with carrying a small amount of medical marijuana which had been prescribed in the US. Tensions between Moscow and the West have been high in recent years, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkm08rv5m0o,"Ukrainian troops now up to 30km inside Russia, Moscow says","Russia's defence ministry said it had engaged in fighting near two villages, some 25-30km inside Russia.",12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:15.775609,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 30km inside Russia, in what has become the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's defence ministry said its forces had engaged Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, as the offensive in the Kursk region entered a sixth day.  Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Kyiv of ""intimidating the peaceful population of Russia"". President Volodymyr Zelensky, who directly acknowledged the attack for the first time in an address last night, said 2,000 cross-border attacks had been launched by Russia from Kursk this summer.  ""Artillery, mortars, drones. We also record missile strikes, and each such strike deserves a fair response,"" Mr Zelensky told the country in his nightly address from Kyiv.  A senior Ukrainian official told the AFP news agency that thousands of troops were engaged in the operation, far more than the small incursion initially reported by Russian border guards.  While Ukrainian-backed sabotage groups have launched intermittent cross-border incursions, the Kursk offensive marks the biggest co-ordinated attack on Russian territory by Kyiv's conventional forces.   “We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border,” the official said.  Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had ""foiled attempts by enemy mobile groups with armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory"".  But in an apparent admission that Kyiv's forces have now advanced deep into the Kursk border region, the defence ministry reported engaging Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez - which are about 25km and 30km from the Russia-Ukraine border. Footage circulating online and verified by the BBC also appeared to show a Russian strike near the village of Levshinka, around 25km from the border. Ukrainian troops have claimed to have captured a number of settlements in the Kursk region. In Guevo, a village about 3km inside Russia, soldiers filmed themselves removing the Russian flag from an administrative building. Clips have also emerged of Ukrainian troops seizing administrative buildings in Sverdlikovo and Poroz, while intense fighting has been reported in Sudzha - a town of about 5,000 people.  Ukrainian troops have already filmed themselves outside Sudzha at a major gas facility involved in the transit of natural gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine, which has continued despite the war. In Sumy region, which borders the Kursk region, BBC reporters witnessed a steady stream of armoured personnel carriers and tanks moving towards Russia.  The armoured convoys are sporting white triangular insignias, seemingly to distinguish them from hardware used within Ukraine itself. Meanwhile, aerial photos have appeared to show Ukrainian tanks engaged in combat inside Russia.  Photos analysed by BBC Verify also appeared to show Russia constructing new defensive lines near the Kursk nuclear power plant. Ukrainian forces engaged at  Obshchy Kolodez were within 50km (31 miles) of the facility.  Contrasting satellite imagery of the same location captured yesterday with imagery from a few days earlier, images show several newly constructed trench lines in the vicinity, with the nearest roughly 8km (5 miles) from the plant. Russia says 76,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the Kursk region, where a state of emergency has been declared by local authorities.  Acting regional governor Aleksei Smirnov also said 15 people were injured late on Saturday when the wreckage of a downed Ukrainian missile fell on a multi-storey building in Kursk's regional capital, Kursk. Oleksiy Goncharenko - a Ukrainian MP - hailed the operation and said it was ""taking us much closer to peace than one hundred peace summits"".  ""When Russia needs to fight back on their own territory, when Russian people are running, when people care, that's the only way to show them stop this war,"" he told the BBC.  The Kursk offensive comes after weeks of Russian advances in the east, where a succession of villages have been captured by the Kremlin's forces. Some analysts have suggested that the Kursk attack is part of an effort to force Russia to redeploy forces away from eastern Ukraine and relieve pressure on the beleaguered Ukrainian defences.  But the Ukrainian official told AFP there had been little let-up to date in Russian operations in the east.  Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the offensive was a ""major provocation"".  Meanwhile, emergency services in the Kyiv region said a man and his four-year-old son were killed in a missile strike near the capital overnight.  Air defences also destroyed 53 out of 57 attack drones launched by Russia during its overnight airstrikes, air force officials said. Four North Korean-manufactured missiles were also fired as part of the barrage, they said.  Russia has been forced to turn to the isolated Asian state to re-stock its munitions, with the US alleging that vast amounts of military hardware have been shipped by Pyongyang.  Elsewhere, Russian officials in the occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast said a fire broke out at the region's nuclear power plant on Sunday.  Yevgeny Balitsky, the Kremlin-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia, claimed the fire erupted after shelling by Ukrainian forces. He said there had been no radiation spike around the plant. Russia's state Tass news agency reported that the main fire at the plant was extinguished in the early hours of Monday.  In a statement posted to X, the UN's nuclear watchdog - the International Atomic Energy Agency - said its on-site inspectors had witnessed ""strong dark smoke"" coming from the north of the facility, but emphasised that there was ""no impact reported"" for nuclear safety.  President Zelensky said in a post to social media that Russian forces had started a fire on the territory of the plant.  The site has been under the control of Russian troops and officials since 2022. It has not produced power in more than two years and all six reactors have been in cold shutdown since April.  With additional reporting by Benedict Garman. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y87gk729do,Zelensky confirms Ukrainian troops fighting inside Russia,"The Ukrainian president says his military is pushing the war onto ""the aggressor's territory"".",11 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:15.874123,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged for the first time that his military is conducting a cross-border offensive inside Russia's western Kursk region. In his video address late on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine's military was pushing the war onto ""the aggressor's territory"". Kyiv launched its surprise attack on Tuesday, rapidly advancing more than 10km (six miles) inside Russia -  the deepest raid since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In Ukraine, the capital Kyiv and several other regions came under a Russian drone and missile attack in the early hours of Sunday, local officials said. In his address, President Zelensky thanked Ukraine's ""warriors"", and said he had discussed the operation in Russia with the country's top military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi. ""Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor,"" he added. Russia has so far struggled to halt the Ukrainian advance, with more than 76,000 people evacuated from the Kursk region and a ""counter-terror"" regime imposed across three border areas.  This means authorities in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions can restrict the movement of people and vehicles and use phone tapping among other measures. The fighting appeared to be ongoing on Saturday night, with Kursk Governor Aleksei Smirnov saying early on Sunday that there were injured people in a ""treacherous"" Ukrainian attack.  He earlier reported that 13 people were injured late on Saturday when the wreckage of a downed Ukrainian missile fell on a multi-storey building in the regional capital Kursk. The governors of Russia's neighbouring Voronezh and Belgorod regions also reported a Ukrainian drone attack overnight. They did not mention any injuries.  In Ukraine, a 35-year-old man and his four-year-old son were killed in the Kyiv region when a rocket fragment fell on residential houses, emergency services said on Sunday. Three more were wounded, including a 13-year-old child. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko posted on Telegram early on Sunday morning that air defence units were ""operating"" and warned civilians to stay in shelters.    Ukraine's rare incursion into Russia began on Tuesday morning, when up to 1,000  troops, supported by tanks and armoured vehicles, entered the Kursk region, Russia said.  The Ukrainians have since reportedly seized a number of villages, and are also threatening the regional town of Sudzha. On Friday, a video emerged showing armed Ukrainian soldiers who claimed to have control over the town, as well as a key Russian gas facility there owned by the Gazprom company. BBC Verify has confirmed that the footage was indeed from the Gazprom facility on the north-western outskirts of Sudzha, about 7km from the border with Ukraine. The video alone does not verify the claim that Ukrainian troops have taken the whole town. Russian military bloggers earlier claimed that the town was still in Moscow's hands. BBC Verify confirmed the location of another video posted online on Friday morning. It shows a 15-vehicle Russian convoy damaged, burned and abandoned on a road through the town of Oktyabrskoe, roughly 38km from the border on the Russian side. The footage also shows Russian soldiers - some injured, some possibly dead - among the vehicles. Moscow has since sent reinforcements - including tanks and rocket-launcher systems - to the Kursk region, saying that Russian troops were ""continuing to repel the attempted invasion"" of Ukrainian forces. The Russian claim has not been independently verified. On Friday, the UN nuclear agency urged both Russia and Ukraine to ""exercise maximum restraint"" as the fighting was edging closer to the Kursk nuclear power plant - one of the biggest such facilities in Russia. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said measures must be taken “to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences”. The power plant is located about 60km north-east of Sudzha."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8xqy0jv24o,New homes and end to price-gouging: Harris sets economic goals,Vice-president Kamala Harris targets housing costs and price gouging in newly-released economic plans.,17 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:15.972673,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Kamala Harris has called for millions of new-build homes and first-time buyer help, tax breaks for families and a ban on grocery ""price-gouging"" in her first speech focused on economic policy. The Democratic presidential nominee's plans build on ideas from the Biden administration and aim at addressing voter concerns after a surge in prices since 2021.  Many of the proposals would require action from Congress, where similar ideas have stalled in the past.  Donald Trump said the vice-president had already had more than three years with the administration to deliver her promises, which his campaign called ""dangerously liberal"".  ""Where has she been and why hasn't she done it?"" he asked.  Ms Harris hit back in a speech on Friday in North Carolina, stating: ""I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look at who they fight for. ""Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations. I will fight to give money back to working and middle class Americans."" The campaign's proposals include a ""first-ever"" tax credit for builders of homes sold to first-time buyers, as well as up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance for ""eligible"" first time buyers, a move that her campaign estimated could reach four million households over four years.  She has also called for capping the monthly price of diabetes-drug insulin at $35 for everyone, finding ways to cancel medical debt, and giving families a $6,000 tax credit the year they have a new child.  She is supporting a federal law banning firms from charging excessive prices on groceries and urged action on a bill in Congress that would bar property owners from using services that ""coordinate"" rents. Democrats and their allies are hoping Ms Harris will prove a more forceful and trusted messenger than President Joe Biden on economic pain. Robert Weissman, the co-president of the consumer watchdog Public Citizen, characterised Ms Harris's plans as a ""pro-consumer, anti-corporate abuse agenda"". ""The [Biden] administration did talk about it but they did not promote proposed measures anywhere near as aggressive as Harris is doing,"" he said. But pollster Micah Roberts, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies, said inflation was likely to remain a challenge for Democrats, noting that voters have a long history of trusting Trump - and Republicans - more on economic issues. ""Trump's been holding the advantage on this stuff for like a year plus,"" said Mr Roberts, the Republican half of a bipartisan team that recently conducted a survey on economic issues for CNBC, which found that Trump still held a big lead over Ms Harris on the topic. Without a huge change, he said it would be ""hard for me to believe"" that the margin had suddenly closed. Though analysts say some of Harris's proposals, such as the ban on price-gouging, are likely to be popular, they have also sparked criticism from some economists. Bans on price-gouging already exist in many states, applied during emergencies such as hurricanes. But economists say the term is difficult to define and widening such rules could end up backfiring, by discouraging firms from making more at times of short supply.  Michael Salinger, a professor of markets, public policy and law at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, said a similar ban was discussed when he served as the lead economist at the Federal Trade Commission during the administration of George W Bush.  ""I thought then that it was a bad idea and I think now that it's a bad idea,"" he said. ""To impose controls on competitive markets will lead to shortages - that's always been our experience."" He said the Harris campaign's other plans would also face questions, given their cost.   For example, the proposal to increase the tax credit for children to as much as $3,600, which Congress did temporarily during the pandemic and opted against extending, would cost more than $1tn, according to some estimates.  With populism ascendant in both parties, that cost has not dissuaded Trump's choice for vice president, JD Vance, from backing an even bigger tax credit expansion.  Prof Salinger said Trump's other economic plans would be unlikely to tackle inflation concerns. Economists predict that increased drilling would have limited impact given the global nature of energy markets and have warned that Trump's pledge to impose a tax of 10% or more on imports would drive up prices.  As it stands, price increases have been subsiding, as the shocks from pandemic-era supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine fade. Inflation, which tracks the pace of price increases, was 2.9% in July, the smallest annual increase since March 2021, the Labor Department said this week.  That is getting closer to the 2% pace considered normal, though prices are up roughly 20% since January 2021. ""The problem that people object to is that even if inflation is down, the prices are still higher and that's true but they're higher because of the natural working of market forces,"" Prof Salinger said. ""Trying to stand in the way of the working of market forces is a lot like trying to stop the tides,"" he added. ""You just can't do it."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78ld18lgr9o,Was Ukraine’s role in big Wagner defeat an own goal in Africa?,Kyiv's hand in aiding rebels in Mali against Russian mercenaries may scupper its Africa diplomacy.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.069470,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"As Ukraine’s foreign minister completes his latest tour of Africa, his country risks paying a serious diplomatic price for helping separatist rebels in northern Mali inflict a severe defeat on the Russian military operator Wagner at the end of last month. The ambush at Tinzaouten on 27 July reportedly killed 84 Wagner fighters and 47 Malian soldiers. It was a painful military blow for the mercenary outfit once headed by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, but now controlled by Russia’s official defence command structure. Just two days later Andriy Yusov, spokesman for Kyiv’s military intelligence service (GUR), said that ethnic Tuareg rebels in Mali had “received necessary information, and not just information, which enabled a successful military operation against Russian war criminals”. Subsequent reports suggested that Ukrainian special forces had trained the separatists in the use of attack drones. Yet for many Africans, this was yet another case of outside powers exploiting the continent as a bloody playing field for their own rivalries. Predictably, Mali’s ruling military junta, and the allied regime in neighbouring Niger, protested by breaking off diplomatic relations with Kyiv. But much more significant was a statement from the regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Despite its own diplomatic issues with the military regimes in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, it was clear in its rebuke. It declared its “firm disapproval and firm condemnation of any outside interference in the region which could constitute a threat to peace and security in West Africa and any attempt aiming to draw the region into current geopolitical confrontations”. The anger will have been strengthened by suggestions that some jihadist militants joined the Tuareg separatists in mounting the Tinzaouaten attack. The Senegalese foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador in Dakar to protest after he posted a Facebook video about Mr Yusov’s gloating comments. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was touring Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius last week. But after the harsh words from Ecowas and Senegal he may now have to engage in some serious fence-mending in West Africa. What many sub-Saharan African governments - even those that privately mistrust Moscow - will probably view as Kyiv’s unhelpful outside military adventurism could dispel the goodwill so painstakingly cultivated over the past two years through peaceful Ukrainian diplomacy. Of course in narrow military terms, helping to inflict the heaviest-ever African defeat on Wagner was a success for the Ukrainians. The mercenary contractor - now officially renamed Corps Africa after being brought under Russian state control - had doubled its manpower to an estimated 2,000 in Mali over the past two years. So news of the heavy losses in Tinzaouaten came as a shock, particularly given that the Malian army and Wagner forces had seized Kidal, the Tuareg rebel “capital”,  last November. The Tinzaouaten incident has signalled the separatists’ return to the offensive –with, it soon became clear, the support of a new partner. Kyiv’s hints of direct involvement confirm how far it is prepared to reach in taking its fightback against Russia’s President Vladimir Putin well beyond the home battlefield. In fact this is not the first such direct intervention against Wagner military operations in Africa. There were strong indications that last August and September Ukrainian special forces carried out drone raids in Sudan in support of the military regime led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. For more than a year, it has been engaged in a brutal power struggle with its former allies the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as ""Hemedti"", who has been assisted by Wagner. Some Ukrainian military commentators, such as Evgeniy Dikiy, former commander of Ukraine’s Aidar battalion, depict their country’s reported African military interventions very much in terms of a battle for survival after Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Mr Dikiy has argued that Kyiv has no Africa policy but does have scores to settle with Russia and Wagner in particular. But the administration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may not see things in quite such simplistic terms. For it knows that the fightback against Moscow is not only conducted on the battlefield. Diplomacy and trade matter too. And in the immediate aftermath of the 2022 invasion, Kyiv was painfully reminded of this truth, particularly in regards to Africa. In the UN General Assembly on 2 March that year, only 28 of the 54 African member states voted to condemn the invasion. While only a few close allies of Moscow actually voted in support of Russia’s action, many other African governments, including some generally perceived as firmly pro-Western, actively abstained or absented themselves from the vote. And later, when President Putin pulled out of the deal allowing both Ukrainian and Russian grain exports - many destined for Africa - to safely transit through the Black Sea, many sub-Saharan governments chose to view this setback in neutral terms rather than blaming Moscow. While that particular issue has faded in significance, because Ukraine has largely recovered its freedom to ship grain after striking the Russian Black Sea fleet, the foreign ministry team in Kyiv has remained convinced of the need to rebuild their political and economic networks across Africa. Mr Kuleba has now made four African tours. And while his campaign to earn goodwill and build partnerships south of the Sahara has not always advanced without a hitch - hopes of being received by President Cyril Ramaphosa during a visit to South Africa late last year were disappointed - there have also been important successes. Zambia, for example, attended the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June and, unlike some other participants, did sign the final communiqué (whose terms satisfied Kyiv). And last week Mr Kuleba visited the Zambian capital, Lusaka, where he was received by President Hakainde Hichilema. In reaching out to African countries now, Ukraine is seeking to make up for the diplomatic ground lost during the first three decades after its independence when it was largely preoccupied with its internal affairs. While Russia inherited the worldwide diplomatic presence of the old Soviet Union, newly independent nations such as Ukraine had to build up their networks from scratch. With limited resources, over 30 years Kyiv managed to open only eight embassies across the entire African continent - in Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. But after being so uncomfortably reminded in 2022 of the need to win friends and influence people, Kyiv is pushing rapidly to expand its coverage, aiming to build a 20-embassy African network, with the first 10 extra missions already announced. April saw Kyiv’s special envoy for the Middle East and Africa, Maksym Soubkh, in Abidjan to open the embassy in Ivory Coast. And Kyiv is proposing more than diplomatic co-operation. Eight sub-Saharan countries have already benefitted from its “Grain from Ukraine” food aid initiative. It also plans to build up its development assistance, strengthen two-way trade and provide more university places for African students. Contentious military adventures targeting Russian mercenaries look an ill-judged risk that could jeopardise all the diplomatic goodwill and economic returns that Ukraine hopes to gain from its broad-based positive sub-Saharan strategy.

The authorities in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions on the border with Ukraine now can restrict the movement of people and vehicles and use phone tapping among other measures. This comes as the Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk region is now in its fifth day. Kyiv has not openly admitted the incursion. Reports say Ukrainian troops are threatening to seize one regional town as they fight more than 10km (six miles) inside Russia - the deepest advance since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The new security measures in the three Russian border regions were announced by the National Counter-Terrorism Committee (Nak) on Friday. It said this was done ""to ensure the safety of citizens and suppress the threat of terrorist acts by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance units"".  The authorities now have powers to enter private homes, restrict the movement of traffic and pedestrians, order the temporary relocation of people and monitor information sent electronically.  This comes as Moscow is struggling to contain the Ukrainian offensive. More than 76,000 people have already been evacuated from the Kursk region's border areas, according to Russia's state Tass news agency. Russia said that up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, supported by tanks and armoured vehicles, entered the Kursk region on Tuesday morning. The Ukrainians have since reportedly seized a number of villages, and are also threatening the regional town of Sudzha. On Friday, a video emerged purportedly showing armed Ukrainian soldiers who claimed to have control over the town, as well as a key Russian gas facility there owned by the Gazprom company.

It shows a 15-vehicle Russian convoy damaged, burned and abandoned on a road through the town of Oktyabrskoe, roughly 38km from the border on the Russian side. The footage also shows Russian soldiers, some injured, possibly dead among the vehicles. Moscow has since sent reinforcements - including tanks and rocket-launching systems - to the Kursk region. In its latest report on Saturday morning, the Russian defence ministry said its troops were ""continuing to repel the attempted invasion"" of Ukrainian forces. It claimed that Ukraine's attempts to ""break through deep into Russian territory"" had been foiled. The Russian claims have not been independently verified. On Friday, the UN nuclear agency urged both Russia and Ukraine to ""exercise maximum restraint"" as the fighting was edging closer to the Kursk nuclear power plant - one of the biggest such facilities in Russia. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said measures must be taken “to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences”. The power plant is located about 60km north-east of Sudzha."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7rn98l8kjo,Ukraine's cross-border attack into Russia enters fifth day,"Russia has declared a ""counter-terror"" operation in three regions, as it struggles to contain the incursion.",10 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:16.294166,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukrainian troops are continuing their offensive in Russia’s western Kursk region, as their surprise cross-border attack enters a fifth day. The Russian defence ministry said on Friday it was “continuing to repel” Ukraine’s military, which it claimed had lost more than 280 personnel in the past 24 hours - a figure that has not been independently verified. Reports suggest that Ukrainian troops are operating more than 10km (six miles) inside Russia - the deepest advance by Kyiv since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine has not openly admitted the incursion, but President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week that Moscow must ""feel"" the consequences for its invasion. Fighting in Kursk has edged gradually closer to a nuclear power plant, prompting the UN nuclear agency to release a statement urging the two sides to “exercise maximum restraint”. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi appealed to all sides to take measures “to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences”. Some residents of the Kursk region were evacuated by authorities, with a group pulling into Moscow’s central train station on Friday. One unnamed resident told AFP news agency: ""It's terrible. They are bombing.” Russia's defence ministry said more troops with heavy armoury were being deployed in the Kursk region. A counter-terrorist operation has been declared there, as well as in the neighbouring Belgorod and Bryansk regions - a move that underlines how grave the current situation is. The local authorities now have powers to restrict the movement of people and vehicles,  allow the use of phone taps and impose temporary evacuations. Separately, Ukraine's military said it had struck a military airfield deep inside Russia on Friday, destroying a warehouse containing hundreds of glide bombs. The targeting of the Lipetsk air base, more than 350km (217 miles) from Ukraine's border, is the kind of operation Kyiv has been wanting to do for some time. The weaponry it managed to destroy in the attack is the very kind Russia has used to terrorise Ukrainian towns, cities and military positions for most of its invasion. The military's statement also said the airfield was known for housing Russia's Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 war planes. Local Russian authorities said a state of emergency was in place in the area, confirming what they described as “detonations” at an ""energy infrastructure facility"". Residents of four nearby villages were evacuated. Hours after Ukraine’s strikes, Russia responded by striking a shopping centre in the Ukrainian town of Kostyantynivka, close to the frontline in the eastern Donetsk region, killing at least 14 people and injuring 43, Ukrainian officials said. Residential buildings, shops and more than a dozen cars were also damaged in the attack. Three days after Ukraine’s offensive was launched on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry said its forces were managing to suppress ""raid attempts by enemy units"". But a video checked by BBC Verify shows a different picture, with a 15-vehicle Russian convoy damaged, burned and abandoned on a road through the town of Oktyabrskoe, roughly 38km (24 miles) from the border on the Russian side. The early morning footage also shows Russian soldiers, some injured, possibly dead among the vehicles. Russia said that up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, supported by tanks and armoured vehicles, entered the Kursk region as the offensive began. Despite the deployment of reserve troops and orders to evacuate, Russia has been unable to slow the momentum of this Ukrainian advance. This is more than the probing attacks we have seen in the past. It is a committed assault which has shocked Russia’s military and the Kremlin. For the last 18 months, it has been Moscow dictating the dynamics of this war. Now it is having to contain this attack, as well as domestic criticism for not preventing it in the first place. Despite long-time Western worries of an escalation, the consensus among Ukraine’s allies is that this operation falls within its right to defend itself. While he is yet to directly reference the assault, President Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday: “Russia has brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.” But with his Ukrainian forces still outnumbered by the Russians on the battlefield, the line between masterstroke and miscalculation is a fine one. The Russian rouble was down 2.5% against the dollar on Friday, with traders telling AFP news agency that Ukraine’s Kursk offensive was one of the reasons behind the fall. "

""Blood on their hands"" is the headline in the Daily Mail, quoting the reaction of the families. The paper describes the findings as ""devastating"". The Daily Mirror's front page says, alongside Calocane's mugshot: ""They were told he could kill"".  Emma Webber, whose teenage son Barnaby was among the three people stabbed to death, tells the Sun that she felt ""visceral and genuine shock"" when reading the report.  Describing Calocane as ""evil, twisted, and vicious"", she accuses mental health services of ""washing their hands"" of him, leaving him free to carry out the attacks. The i reports that the government is drawing up plans to evacuate British nationals from across the Middle East in the event that an Iranian attack on Israel triggers a wider war in the region.  Whitehall sources tell the paper that officials are ""really, really concerned” about what they call an ""uncontrollable"" move towards escalation.  According to the Daily Telegraph, such a strike ""could come within days"", possibly before Gaza ceasefire talks resume on Thursday. The former home secretary, James Cleverly, tells the Daily Express that the government needs to ""get a grip, and fast"" on illegal migration, after more than 700 people crossed the Channel in a single day.  The Conservative leadership hopeful accuses Sir Keir Starmer of ""doing nothing"" to ""stop the boats"".  Downing Street insists it is working to ""smash the gangs responsible"". According to the Telegraph, one way Sir Keir is planning to do that is by working with his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni. The paper says he has expressed support for Ms Meloni's plans to overhaul the EU's police force, to make it focus on tackling people smuggling. Sir Keir is said to have floated the idea of officers from the UK conducting joint operations with Europol. Sources tell the Financial Times that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is considering turning to the private sector to pay for a £9bn highway and tunnel crossing the Thames.  The paper says that investors in the Lower Thames Crossing, which is due to link Kent and Essex, would receive returns from the toll road. The Guardian says that Labour MPs are closing their accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, because of what they call the spread of hate and disinformation on the platform.  One backbencher tells the paper that the website has become a ""megaphone for foreign adversaries and far-right fringe groups"" with an unnamed government minister saying they have cut down on posting on the site and are ""reluctant to return"". And the Times reports on the dying out of an age-old British tradition - a trip to the pub after work.  It highlights research by the think tank, the Work Foundation, which suggests that remote working, and a tendency among some younger employees to remain sober, mean that companies should instead host ""breakfast socials and away days"".  But, defending a post-work pint in its leader column, the paper says the pub "" remains the best place to let off steam, imbibe the wisdom of elders and turn workmates into lifelong friends"".

It was not clear what caused the fire or whether it was related to the fighting in Kursk.  A red threat level alert had been issued in Lipetsk, but was later lifted on Friday morning. The regional governor Igor Artamonov earlier said an energy infrastructure facility had been damaged and power supply disruptions reported.  Local leaders in regions adjacent to Kursk, in both Russia and Ukraine, also told residents to leave for their safety.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq59pqr9qxo,Inflation rate rises for first time this year to 2.2%,"The UK inflation rate has risen to 2.2%, but this was not as high as economists had forecast.",14 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:24.326498,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The UK's inflation rate has risen for the first time this year, official figures show.  Overall prices rose by 2.2% in the year to July, slightly above the Bank of England’s target of 2% where the rate had been since May. A rise was widely predicted and is due to prices of gas and electricity falling by less than they did a year before. The increase is also less than many economists had expected.  The latest figures mean that prices are now rising faster across the UK than in previous months, but still at a slower pace than in 2022 and 2023 when households were hit especially hard by higher energy and food bills. The Bank of England expects inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise - to go up to 2.75% in the coming months before falling below 2% next year. Another set of inflation figures, as well as employment and wages data, will be released before its next rate-setting meeting on 19 September. The Bank had put up interest rates to tackle soaring inflation but last month cut them to 5% from 5.25% - the first reduction since the start of the pandemic. Higher rates can be good for savers but may drive up the cost of mortgages and other loans for consumers. Experts have been predicting further cuts this year, with investors now raising their bets that the Bank will opt for a cut in September.  Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank Research, said: ""A September rate cut should no longer be off the table. And it’s entirely conceivable to think that we could get multiple more rate cuts this year."" But Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at research group Capital Economics, said Wednesday’s data “may not alleviate the Bank’s concerns about persistent price pressures entirely”.  The Bank also looks at inflation in the services sector, for example, when deciding on rates. While prices in this sector slowed to 5.2% in July, this was partly attributed to airfares and hotel stays which can be quite volatile. Gregory added, however, that she expects the Bank to cut again this year, bringing its main interest rate down to 4.5% from 5%. Interest rate cuts could be good news for businesses, which have been dealing with higher rates and surging inflation over the last few years. Livia Marrocco, owner of Marrocco’s restaurant and ice cream shop in Hove, told the BBC: “Products have gone up. Ingredients have gone up. We have put prices up slightly.” However, she said that things have been looking up recently as the good weather  and school holidays were bringing in more customers. Inflation surged to 11.1% in the wake of the Ukraine war and pandemic-related supply chain crunches, driving up the cost of living for millions.  But it had been steadily falling until June, as the Bank of England increased interest rates to dampen consumer demand. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: ""Inflation ticked up a little in July as although domestic energy costs fell, they fell by less than a year ago. ""This was partially offset by hotel costs, which fell in July after strong growth in June."" Mr Fitzner also told the BBC's Today programme on Wednesday that ""under the bonnet"" price rises remained under control, with services inflation down in July and food prices unchanged.  ""This still suggests that inflation pressures at least in the short run are fairly moderate,"" he said. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, food and drink prices surged by 28.4% between September 2021 and September 2023. Its latest analysis suggested that less well-off households saw their food bill rise by far more than those with higher incomes, as the sharpest price increases had been applied to cheaper brands. But in July, food price inflation had settled down to just 1.5%, according to the ONS. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the new Labour government is ""under no illusion"" about the challenges still facing households. But shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt said that the new figures show that there is ""more to be done to keep inflation down"".  The prospect that further falls in interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowing could create a pick-up in activity in the housing market. Separate figures published by the ONS on Wednesday show that house prices have been rising, although the data pre-dates August’s cut in interest rates. UK property prices rose by 2.7% in the year to the end of June, the ONS said. In England, an increase of 2.4% pushed the average house price above £300,000. The increase of £7,000 in the year meant the cost of an average home in England stood at £305,000, compared with £216,000 in Wales, £192,000 in Scotland, and £185,000 in Northern Ireland.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jpn2q76n1o,Trump's chat with Musk on X fact-checked,"In a two-hour discussion, Trump made a number of questionable and false claims which went largely unchallenged.",13 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:24.423519,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"In a two-hour discussion with Elon Musk, on the billionaire's platform X, Donald Trump made a number of questionable and false claims - which went largely unchallenged.  The Republican presidential candidate returned to some familiar campaign themes, such as illegal immigration and rising prices, but he also talked about climate change. BBC Verify has been checking some of his claims.  CLAIM: “The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years.” VERDICT: According to climate projections, Trump is vastly underestimating the rise in sea levels.  In the decade 2014-2023, global average sea levels rose by an average of nearly 4.8mm per year (0.19in), according to the World Meteorological Organization. That increase is already greater than the one eighth of an inch (0.13in) that Mr Trump predicts will happen over the next 400 years. The magnitude of future rises is difficult to predict, because it is uncertain how quickly ice-sheets will melt, and future warming will depend on greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated a likely range of 0.28 to 1.01m of global sea-level rise by 2100 - although higher rises can’t be ruled out.  A sea-level rise of one metre would put hundreds of millions of people at risk of more regular coastal flooding, as well as submerging parts of low-lying countries such as the Maldives. CLAIM: “I think 20 million people have come across the border... I think millions are coming every month.” VERDICT: It isn’t possible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have entered the US across its southern border during President Biden’s time in office. Official data suggests it did hit record levels but not the kinds of numbers Trump claims. Since January 2021, the US Customs and Border Protection agency says there have been 10.1m encounters of illegal migrants by enforcement officers in the US, with more than 8m of those coming over the southern border. These figures don’t necessarily mean all these people successfully entered the US - some may have been sent back and the same person could be “encountered” trying to cross the border multiple times. The official figures do represent a significant increase on the four years under Trump, and it is also the highest figure recorded under any US administration. The data doesn't show ""millions"" coming every month either. US Border Patrol agents apprehended around 57,000 migrants along the southern border in July - the lowest recorded since September 2020. The numbers are down significantly from the peak under Mr Biden in December 2023, when around 250,000 migrants were caught crossing the border. CLAIM: “I think we have the worst inflation we've had in 100 years... bacon costing four or five times more than it did a few years ago”. VERDICT: This is false. Inflation peaked at 9.1% under President Biden - the highest in 41 years, not 100. The price of bacon is up 17% since Trump left office, not four or five times. Inflation rose significantly during the first two years of the Biden administration, reaching the highest level since 1981. This was comparable with many other Western countries, which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues as a consequence of Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices. Some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) spending plan in 2021 was a factor as well. Since mid 2022, US inflation has fallen, with the latest monthly figure at 3% as of June. In terms of bacon - the average price for a pound of sliced bacon was $5.83 in January 2021 when Trump left office, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It now costs $6.83. CLAIM: ""I built hundreds of miles of wall"" to protect the southern border. VERDICT: The length of border wall built during Trump’s presidency depends on what you are measuring, but if you include new sections as well as parts that have been replaced or reinforced, he built more than 450 miles. A report by US Customs and Border Protection puts the total at 458 miles. However, only 85 miles of entirely new sections of wall were built under Trump. The rest has been either replacing or reinforcing existing barriers. President Biden suspended construction when he came into office, but last year his administration allowed the building of a section of wall in an effort to stop rising levels of immigration. The section approved by Mr Biden is for 20 miles of barriers along the border in southern Texas. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

Russian prosecutors are seeking a 15-year sentence after the security services accused Ms Karelina of collecting money that was used to purchase tactical supplies for the Ukrainian army. She was detained by authorities in Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow after a family visit in February. The sentence comes one week after Russia and the West carried out the largest prisoner exchange since the Cold War, where 24 people jailed in seven different countries were exchanged. Ms Karelina's lawyer said the prosecutors' request for a 15-year sentence in a penal colony was too severe as the defendant had cooperated with the investigation. Mikhail Mushailov also said it was ""impossible"" for Ms Karelina to have been included in the recent prisoner exchange, because an exchange can only happen once the court verdict comes into force.  ""After the verdict, of course, we will work in this direction,"" Mr Mushailov told reporters on Thursday. The Los Angeles resident had been living away from Russia for several years and gained American citizenship in 2021.  She travelled to Russia for a family visit back in January, and has since been prevented from returning to her home in Los Angeles.  It has been widely reported that investigators brought the treason charge against her after discovering she had donated around $50 (£39) to Razom, a charity that supports Ukraine. The charity said it was ""appalled"" to hear of the amateur ballerina's arrest. Ms Karelina's charges and trial come after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in April last year increasing the maximum sentence for treason to life in jail, up from 20 years, as part of a crackdown on dissent. Speaking with the BBC at the time of Ms Karelina's arrest, her partner said she was ""proud to be Russian"" - and had remained confident that she could travel in the country, he explained. Chris Van Heerden has been campaigning since news of the arrest for the US government to free his girlfriend from Russian detention.  The FSB said Ms Karelina had been detained in Yekaterinburg in February - the same city in which US journalist Evan Gershkovich was arrested on charges of espionage on 29 March last year. On 1 August Mr Gershkovich was one of 16 prisoners freed and returned to Europe and the US in return for eight Russian prisoners who were released from prisons in the US, Norway, Germany, Poland and Slovenia."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d1yx9nwjxo,Why has Ukraine launched a cross-border attack on Russia?,"Vladimir Putin called the attack a ""provocation"", but Kyiv's objectives are not immediately clear.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:24.619793,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When Kyiv launched a cross-border raid into Russia’s Kursk region bordering Ukraine, the question from some military experts was: “Why?” One of Ukraine’s biggest battlefield issues is manpower. Russia has more soldiers and is inching closer to the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk. So, sending hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers into Russia itself is, shall we say, counterintuitive in the eyes of some. But not all. “It wasn’t accidental,” said war expert Kostyantyn Mashovets in a Facebook post. “It’s clearly part of one clear plan."" Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov, a military analyst, agrees. He told the BBC that Russia had been forced to redeploy some troops there from the front line in eastern Ukraine. “If you look at official reports, there were significantly fewer Russian glide bombs dropped in the Donetsk area,” he said. “That means the aircraft which carry them are now elsewhere in Russia.” This incursion is extremely unlikely to be Ukraine looking to occupy Russian territory, but if pulling in Russian forces was a goal, it is quickly being realised. Recent history could be playing a role too. Russia launched a major cross-border offensive of its own into Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. The advance seems to have slowed after the US gave Ukraine permission to use its missiles on targets inside Russia. Ukrainian fears of a similar attack into the northern Sumy region have been mounting in the subsequent three months. Given constant Western worries of the war escalating, it’s likely some sort of permission was granted for an operation of this size on Russian soil. In general, very few senior Ukrainian figures are saying much about this attack. The president's office told us: “No comment, yet."" While similar incursions have happened before, it is the first time regular Ukrainian forces have been used in this way. Where there is much more chatter, is across the border. Russian military channels were quick to report the assault involving hundreds of troops and several rocket and drone attacks. Local officials were also swift in announcing casualties and evacuations. Neighbouring regions expressed a willingness to accept those forced from their homes. A state of emergency has been declared there as well. Russia’s Defence Ministry even admitted troops were being redeployed in the direction of Sudzha, a town in the Kursk region. At the top of the food chain there was Vladimir Putin being publicly briefed by his security chiefs. His Foreign Ministry spokesperson called the attack “barbaric” and “terrorist”. It was a Russian response which suggested it had been blindsided in a war of recent familiarity. Until yesterday Russia had steadily been capturing territory while outnumbering Ukrainian forces. Now it has something else to think about. The assault is already being presented by the Kremlin as evidence as to why it should continue to wage its war - an invasion it still frames as “defensive”. “There are more questions than answers from events in the Kursk region,” suggests Military analyst Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov. Clearly for Ukraine, if it stalls or even prevents Russia from mounting a major attack in its north, it will see this operation as worth it. “The more pressure is exerted on the aggressor that brought the war to Ukraine,” said President Zelensky in his evening address, “The closer peace will be.” “Just peace through just force.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n9y4nm3lo,State of emergency declared as Ukraine launches raid into Russia,"Fighting has been taking place since Tuesday, with footage showing smoke rising in some areas.",8 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:24.723561,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A state of emergency has been declared in the Kursk region of Russia, as a rare cross-border attack by Ukrainian troops continued on Wednesday. The acting regional governor, Alexei Smirnov, said the move was necessary ""to eliminate the consequences of enemy forces coming into the region"". Russian officials said at least five civilians had been killed and 31 wounded, six of them children, since the start of the incursion. Ukraine has not officially commented and the depth of the incursion remains unclear. On Tuesday morning, up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, as well as 11 tanks and more than 20 armoured combat vehicles, entered Russia near the town of Sudzha, Moscow said. Fighting reportedly took place in a number of villages throughout Tuesday, with local authorities urging residents to limit their movements and all public events cancelled. A number of air alerts were issued in Kursk and footage posted online – verified by the BBC - showed fighter jets flying low over the region, with smoke rising from areas on the ground. Thousands of people were evacuated from border areas and doctors were being drafted in from other cities, Mr Smirnov said. Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory have been extremely rare since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko said the Ukrainian army had established control over the Sudzha gas hub, a major gas facility involved in the transit of natural gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine, which has continued despite the war. It is the only point of entry for Russian gas into the EU. Although the claim has not been verified by the BBC, Mr Honcharenko's comment was the first confirmation of an incursion into Russian territory by a Ukrainian official. Mr Honcharenko said on Facebook that while he did not know what the ""plan"" behind the incursion was, it would show ""Europeans and Americans that... Russia can and needs to be attacked"". Russia's military response to the incursion will be one of Andrei Belousov's first big leadership tests as the country's new defence minister, after he replaced his long-serving predecessor Sergei Shoigu in May. Speaking to the BBC’s Newshour, Mr Honcharenko added that ""from a military point of view, we are trying to take back the initiative”. “We are showing the world that the world should not be scared of escalation or the reaction of Putin. There is no reaction,” he said. “For the first time since the Second World War, Russian territory that is internationally recognised is occupied and Putin did not [turn] to nukes and so on."" He said the incursion would also force Russia to move troops to the region and hopefully decrease the number of attacks it can carry out in eastern Ukraine. In a lukewarm reaction White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the US had no prior knowledge of the attack and that it planned to reach out to the Ukrainian military ""to learn more about their objectives"". Speaking on Wednesday, Ms Jean-Pierre said Washington will continue to ensure Kyiv has what it needs ""to defend themselves against Russia's aggression"". In a televised meeting with government officials on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of launching a ""major provocation"" and ""firing indiscriminately"" at civilian buildings and residences. Russia's Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the ""advance"" into the Kursk region had been stopped, with Russian forces ""continuing to destroy the adversary in areas directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border"". Mr Gerasimov said Ukrainian forces aimed to take over the area around the town of Sudzha, and that Russia had already killed 100 men and injured another 215. However, some popular and generally well-informed pro-war Telegram channels suggested the situation on the ground was not as stable as the Kremlin said. Blogger Yuri Kotenok described the battles taking place in Sudzha and nearby Korenevo as ""heavy"", while the channel Rybar said that the situation in the area around Sudzha was ""continuing to deteriorate"" and Ukrainian formations were advancing towards the town. The BBC is unable to verify these claims. The influential pro-war Rybar Telegram channel went on to strongly criticise the highest ranks of the Russian military on Wednesday, saying that ""for two months the full information was sent to the useless headquarters"", adding that there was enough time ""to make an appropriate decision"". Rybar's concerns were echoed by several other pro-war bloggers, who are very popular with Russian readers. They often offer a more critical perspective of military developments than the Kremlin, without questioning whether or not the war is necessary. The Russian National Guard said it had strengthened the security of the Kursk nuclear power plant, which lies some 70km (43 miles) north-east of Sudzha. In its latest report, the Institute for the Study of War said geolocated footage from the past two days show that Ukrainian armoured vehicles have advanced to positions 10km into the Kursk region. In the Belgorod region, which neighbours Kursk, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov also issued missile attack warnings throughout Tuesday and said several people had been injured in Ukrainian air attacks. On Wednesday, the head of the Ukrainian region of Sumy, Volodymyr Artyukh, ordered the evacuation of the areas that border Kursk. One colonel in Ukraine’s military, Vladislav Seleznyov, told the prominent Nexta channel the attack was “preventative”, with an estimated 75,000 Russian troops continuing to gather close to the border. After a major cross-border incursion by Russia into the north-eastern Kharkiv region in May, there had been fears Moscow would attempt the same into the Sumy region further north. With Ukraine now apparently capturing several settlements and highways the other way, those ambitions may well have been frustrated for now. But with Ukrainian forces already overstretched and outmanned, some military analysts are questioning the wisdom of such cross-border raids. This is not the first incursion into Russia by fighters based in Ukraine. Some groups of anti-Kremlin Russians launched raids last year, which were repelled. The forces crossed into the Belgorod and Kursk regions again in March, where they engaged in clashes with Russian security forces. For the past few months Russia has made incremental gains in eastern Ukraine, as many of Kyiv's ground forces have faced relentless attacks in the eastern Donbas region. In a recent interview Ukraine's head of defence intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said the main offensive by Russian forces ""is expected to be over in a month and a half to two months""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd7493309eo,Niger's junta cuts diplomatic ties with Ukraine,"Niger follows Mali's lead, signalling a burgeoning rift with Kyiv.",7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:24.822622,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Niger has cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine, a move which signals a burgeoning rift between some West African states and Kyiv. Niger's military government said it made the move in ""solidarity"" with neighbouring Mali, who severed their own relations with Ukraine two days ago. Both countries cited comments by a Ukrainian military official, who suggested Kyiv played a role in the killing of dozens of Malian soldiers last month. Ukraine has been trying to win allies in Africa throughout its war with Russia, likely in an attempt to counter Moscow's growing influence on the continent. At the end of July, scores of Malian soldiers, along with mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, were killed in clashes with separatist rebels and al-Qaeda-linked militants. Mali's military regime had turned to the notorious Wagner group in 2021, seeking support in tackling its crippling insecurity issues. After Wagner confirmed ""losses"" in July's attack, Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence, said the rebels received ""the necessary information they needed"" to conduct the attacks. He did not elaborate. In response to Mr Yusov's comment, Mali accused Ukraine of violating its sovereignty and announced it was breaking off relations with Ukraine ""with immediate effect"". Niger followed suit on Tuesday, with government spokesman Amadou Abdramane calling Mr Yusov's remarks ""unacceptable"". Mali's neighbour Senegal also rebuked Ukraine. Over the weekend, Senegal's foreign ministry summoned Ukraine’s ambassador, Yurii Pyvovarov, accusing him of supporting July's attack in Mali in a since-deleted video posted on the Ukrainian embassy’s Facebook account. Ukraine's foreign ministry has not yet commented on Niger's decision to sever diplomatic ties. However, it called Mali's decision ""short-sighted and hasty"", and said Ukraine ""unconditionally"" complies with international law and accused Russian-controlled outfits of ""numerous war crimes"" in African countries. Russia weighed in on the matter on Wednesday, accusing Ukraine of opening a ""second front"" in Africa. ""The regime of [Ukrainian President] Zelensky is pandering to terrorist groups in countries on the continent friendly to Moscow,"" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the RIA Novosti news agency. In recent years, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have undergone coups and their new military government's have ripped up defence agreements with France and the US, preferring military help from Russia. As Russia's popularity on the continent expands, Ukraine has attempted to strengthen its ties with African nations. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba is currently on his fourth visit to Africa in the last two years - this time he is visiting Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius. Presently, it is hard to tell whether other West African countries might follow Niger and Mali in cutting ties with Ukraine.  Many will be waiting to see the reaction of Burkina Faso, which formed a bloc with Niger and Mali earlier this year and is also ruled by the military. West Africa is not the only region to be impacted by the Ukraine-Russia war. In Sudan, Wagner is alleged to be backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been at war with the Sudanese army for more than a year now. Meanwhile, widely circulated videos show what is reported to be Ukrainian special forces carrying out drone strikes, and other armed attacks, against the RSF and Wagner fighters in Sudan. The BBC has not been able to verify these videos. As Russia and Ukraine's war continued to play out in Africa, more than 70 mourners gathered in Moscow to pay homage to the Wagner fighters killed in July's attack. Red carnations were laid below pictures of fallen fighters at a memorial on Sunday, press agency Reuters reported, while some attendees lit candles.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqr48zld2o,"Long-doubted by Democrats, Kamala Harris faces her biggest political moment",She has generated huge voter enthusiasm since becoming the party’s presidential candidate - and it reflects years of deliberate preparation for a role many thought she wasn’t cut out for.,18 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:24.902769,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When Kamala Harris steps onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week as the party’s presidential nominee, she’ll do so knowing that many in the audience cheering her on once counted her out. Ms Harris, 59, has faced years of doubt from some within her party about her ability to run for America’s highest political office - including from President Joe Biden, the man whom she continues to serve as vice-president. Since replacing Mr Biden as Democratic nominee in mid-July, Ms Harris has seen a tidal wave of enthusiasm for her candidacy - reflected in polling, fundraising and the enormous crowds that have come out to see her at rallies across the country. But the political momentum and energy she has generated in recent weeks among Democrats was never a given. After failing in a short-lived presidential bid in 2019, she began her vice-presidency on a shaky footing, beset by stumbles in high-profile interviews, staff turnover and low approval ratings. And for the last three-and-a-half years in the White House she has struggled to break through to American voters. Advisers and allies say that in the years since those early struggles she has sharpened her political skills, created loyal coalitions within her party and built credibility on issues like abortion rights that energise the Democratic base. She has, in other words, been preparing for a moment exactly like this one. On Thursday, as she formally accepts the Democratic nomination, Ms Harris has an opportunity to reintroduce herself on the national stage with fewer than 80 days until an election that could see her become the nation’s first female president. At the same time, she’ll have to prove that she is capable of leading a party that never saw her as its natural leader and remains divided over the war in Israel and Gaza. But above all, she’ll need put to rest any lingering doubt among the Democratic faithful that she can meet the challenge of defeating former president Donald Trump in what remains a tight and unpredictable contest. Before Kamala Harris became a national figure, the former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general had forged a reputation as a rising star in the party, landing the endorsement of President Barack Obama in her 2010 race to become the state’s top lawyer. But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state’s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. “Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden’s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling. She attacked Mr Biden for an earlier campaign moment in which he fondly recalled working with two segregationist senators, before accusing him of opposing the bussing of students between schools to help integrate them. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Ms Harris said. “And that little girl was me.” But campaign infighting and indecision on which issues to emphasise ultimately sank her presidential bid. The campaign was marked by “a lot of rookie mistakes”, said Kevin Madden, an adviser on Republican Mitt Romney’s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. “The substance that needed to be there to pass the commander-in-chief test and to really fill in some of the blanks for voters, it just wasn’t there and as a result her opponents filled it in for her.” Eight months later, Mr Biden put aside their primary rivalry and announced Ms Harris as his running mate. She became the first woman of colour to ever be nominated in that position - and in January 2021, the first female vice-president in US history. It was five months into her job as Mr Biden’s vice-president that Ms Harris endured her first public stumble during a foreign trip to Guatemala and Mexico. The trip was meant to showcase her role in pursuing economic initiatives to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the US southern border, a foreign policy assignment given to her by Mr Biden. But it was quickly overshadowed by an awkward exchange in an interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt, in which she dismissed repeated questions about why she had not yet visited the US-Mexico border. Later that day, during a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Ms Harris tried to recapture the narrative, delivering a stark message to migrants thinking of making their way to the US. “Do not come,” she told them. “Do not come.” While the NBC News interview fuelled Republican attacks that continue to this day, the latter comments drew the ire of progressives and were quickly panned on social media, even though other administration officials had echoed the same rhetoric. The vice-president’s allies blamed the White House for failing to adequately prepare her and assigning an unwinnable issue. They complained that as the first woman, African-American and Asian-American to serve as vice-president, outsized expectations had been imposed on her from the very start of her term, giving her little time to settle. “There was immense pressure in the beginning to own things,” said one former aide who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their time in the White House. In the months that followed, Ms Harris endured more scrutiny as she faced high staff turnover, a slew of negative headlines about her performance and underwhelming media appearances. Hemmed in by Covid restrictions, she was limited in her public engagements, fuelling the perception that she was invisible. When critics labelled her a prop for standing behind Mr Biden at bill-signing ceremonies – as her white male predecessors in the role regularly did – a decision was made to remove her from those events altogether, according to aides, triggering more criticism that she was absent. “People had an expectation to experience her as vice-president as if she was Michelle Obama, but she was in a job… built for Al Gore or Mike Pence,” said Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist who was brought in as her communications director during the second year. As her team sought to improve her poor public image, Ms Harris stepped into a bigger foreign policy role. She travelled to Poland in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, held bilateral meetings in Asia amid heightened tensions with China and stood in for Mr Biden at the Munich Security Conference that same year. But in May 2022, a political earthquake would reshape the trajectory of her vice-presidency. In a rare breach of the Supreme Court, a leaked draft opinion revealed plans to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade abortion ruling - which had protected American women’s federal right to abortion for nearly half a century. She seized on the opportunity to be the lead messenger on an issue that Mr Biden – a devout Irish Catholic who avoided even saying the term “abortion” – was reluctant to own. “How dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body?” she told the crowd at an event for a pro-choice group on the same day the bombshell leak was published, deciding to attack the nation’s top judges before their decision was officially released. The issue proved to be a driving force for voters in the midterm elections a few months later, helping Democrats to perform better than expected in congressional races and to hold the Senate. In seeking to become the administration’s leading voice on abortion, Ms Harris tackled the issue with “clarity of purpose”, said former longtime adviser Rachel Palermo. She convened state legislators, faith leaders, constitutional law experts, healthcare providers and advocates for roundtable discussions. It was a move panned by some activists as not meeting the seriousness of the moment but it was part of a strategy of coalition-building across local and state politics that also helped lay the groundwork for any future presidential run. Ms Harris, who spent most of her career navigating California’s tricky mix of liberal and traditional Democratic politics, knew every event mattered. Every meeting, photo opportunity or dinner - whether it was with black business leaders or Hispanic female CEOs – was tracked by her team in detailed spreadsheets that she could utilise when the time came to call on a deep political network for support. “She forced the operation to mobilise around how she views politics, which is coalitions,” a senior official said. Ms Harris always had her eye on a 2028 bid for the White House, as Joe Biden’s natural successor, assuming he won a second term in the 2024 contest. Yet as rumblings mounted about replacing Mr Biden on the ticket after his stumbling debate performance in late June against Donald Trump, some Democrats openly overlooked her. They, and many pundits, suggested popular governors like California’s Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro or Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer as better replacements who could motivate voters and take the fight to Trump. On 21 July, Mr Biden phoned Ms Harris to tell her of his plans to drop out of the race and endorse her as his successor. It was a decision that took many of his closest allies by surprise, but she sprang into action. Over the course of 10 hours that Sunday, she called more than 100 party officials, members of Congress, labour leaders and activists. Within days, any potential rivals, including the powerful governors, had fallen into line and it was clear that she would take the Democratic mantle with no serious challenge. As a candidate, the vice-president has yet to lay out a detailed policy agenda or sit down for a tough media interview. She released an economic blueprint on Friday, calling for tax cuts for families and a wider push on capping drug pricing, her most detailed vision for the country so far. Even as Republicans  accuse her of avoiding scrutiny, the team around her see no rush in cutting off the momentum she’s built over the last month. Political strategists say the campaign is right to capitalise on the “sugar high”. “What Kamala Harris is experiencing is a massive, pent-up demand for people to vote for anybody not named Biden or Trump,” said Mr Madden, the former Romney aide and Republican communications strategist. “But the test always comes with being exposed to interviews, the press, debates and the harsh glare of a campaign.” Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who helped organise a meeting of historians at Ms Harris’s official residence last year, said the fact that she has been a blank slate for voters is more of a benefit than a burden. “She may not have been able to be in full bloom under Biden but she never crossed wires with him,” he said. “So she was able to be positioned for this moment and she can take what’s good about the Biden years and shed the baggage of what she wants to, or slightly disagrees with.” Though her entrance has jolted an outpouring of support among Democrats, it’s unclear whether she can translate that into broad appeal. While Ms Harris has made some inroads with key demographic groups that had drifted from Mr Biden – black, Latino and young voters in particular – she lags in other constituencies that made up his winning 2020 coalition. Recent polling puts her ahead or tied with Trump in six of the seven battleground states, according to a Cook Political Report survey released on Wednesday. In May, when Mr Biden was still the Democratic candidate, Trump was ahead or tied in all seven states. Thursday night’s speech at the Democratic convention is the most consequential moment in Kamala Harris’s political career. While the Republican convention served as a coronation for Trump, who was nominated as his party’s candidate for the third consecutive time, Ms Harris’s sudden rise means her speech will be seen as a pivotal moment to define who she really is. While she’s stood on the stage before, a senior aide said the speech will have a heavier focus on her personal story than previous nominees. “This is the why part of the conversation. Why is she running for president? What is her vision for the country?” said Mr Simmons, her former communications director. “That will help tie together all of the strands of her policy and political life that will make sense for people.” But over the course of four days, Ms Harris will need to sharpen her messaging around crime, inflation, the economy and immigration – issues the Trump campaign will relentlessly target between now and election day. Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican strategist, said Ms Harris will also at some point have to clarify the left-leaning positions she took in 2019 during her failed presidential bid. ""Her greatest vulnerability is that there is plenty of evidence that she's a San Francisco liberal with a whole set of far left wing policy positions that are outside the mainstream of American thinking, and she hasn't had to answer for those yet,"" he said.  She will also be confronted with protests over Israel’s actions in Gaza, a polarising issue that has politically cleaved the party. Ms Harris has been more forceful in her calls for a ceasefire and condemnation of civilian deaths than President Biden, but she has not wavered from the administration’s steadfast support for Israel - a stance that risks alienating the party’s progressive wing. “How she positions [herself on Gaza] is going to be her hardest trick,” said Mr Brinkley, the presidential historian. Still, allies and advisers who have been preparing her over the last week contend she’s built the foundations for a presidential run over the last four – sometimes bumpy – years, even if few expected she would actually find herself in this position at this moment. “Opportunity is preparation meeting a little bit of luck and I wouldn’t characterise this as luck, because nobody wanted it to be this way, but certainly she was prepared to meet the moment of opportunity,” a senior political adviser said. Susie Tompkins Buell, a Democratic donor and co-founder of Esprit and The North Face who has known Ms Harris since the 1990s, said she wasn’t surprised by how Ms Harris had performed in the last few weeks. In the days after Mr Biden’s halting debate performance, she attended an event with the vice-president and said she could tell change was afoot. After telling Ms Harris to fasten her seatbelt, Ms Buell said the soon-to-be Democratic nominee quipped, “I was born with a seatbelt.” “I liked her response,” said Ms Tompkins Buell, who helped Ms Harris raise $12m at a San Francisco fundraiser earlier this month. “It was sudden and it was right on. She’s ready.”"

Newcastle's Ukrainian community has been weaving the nets, which have all been sent to the front line,  since war with Russia broke out in 2022. Meeting to weave is a chance for the women, many of whom are beyond retirement age, to socialise and combat loneliness.  Nataliya Sloutenko, who arrived from Kyiv last year, said she was ""grateful"" she could help the soldiers back home. Weaving gives the women a chance to speak in their own language, sing traditional songs and share Ukrainian food with each other.  ""It unites us as we speak our language here,"" continued Ms Sloutenko. ""We communicate and being part of this community helps me, as I know we're going our bit to help soldiers in Ukraine.""  Made from gardening net and strips of fabric from charity shops, the nets have been sent as part of care packages, which also contain medical essentials, small gifts for children and knitted socks for amputees. Lesya Bourn, who helps organise the meetings at Newcastle's Polish Centre, spoke about the importance of the project, both for the women and Ukraine. ""Everyone is on their own front line and our front line is here,"" said Ms Bourn.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cy0rnpp14dvo,Paris Olympics: The best stats from the 2024 Games,BBC Sport looks at the best stats from the 2024 Paris Games.,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:36.866586,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"This video can not be played Olympics 2024: Every Team GB Olympic medal in Paris After 16 action-packed days, Paris 2024 has reached its conclusion. It has delivered sporting drama by the bucketload, the emergence of new heroes, world records have been broken and plenty of history written. So what are the stats to savour from this Olympic Games? BBC Sport takes a look... *The Netherlands were sixth with a total of 34 medals - 15 golds, seven silvers and 12 bronze The United States top the medal table for the seventh time in eight Olympic Games. At all eight, they have won the most overall medals. Great Britain matched their total number of medals from London 2012 as they passed the 60-medal mark for a fourth successive Olympics. Their tally of 65 was one better than Tokyo three years ago but it proved a Games of silver linings with just 14 golds collected, their lowest since Athens in 2004. Meanwhile, Japan followed on from their record-breaking success at their home Tokyo Games in which they won 27 golds, and excelled with another 20 golds, which is their second highest tally of all time. Their total was buoyed by their status as powerhouses in the wrestling, where they won eight golds at the Champ de Mars Arena. Australia's 18 golds also helped them to a fourth-placed finish as they beat their previous best total of 17 in Athens and Tokyo. This video can not be played McLaughlin-Levrone wins gold with new world record Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone smashed her own world record as she stormed to a sensational Olympic 400m hurdles gold in a time of 50.37 seconds, while her fellow Americans Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Kaylyn Brown and Bryce Deadmon set a new mark in the 4x400m mixed relay. Sweden's Armand Duplantis had already wrapped up the men's pole vault gold medal when he improved his world best of 6.24m, that he set in April, by one centimetre.  There were 31 world records broken overall, with the highest percentage (39%) arriving in the velodrome. Great Britain's Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane were responsible for three of those on the way to gold in the women's team sprint. That compares favourably to Tokyo where 22 world records went and is also slightly above the 27 that were eclipsed in Rio eight years ago. Reports have suggested the Olympic pool's relatively shallow depth of seven feet may have slowed down swimmers due to increased turbulence. Paris 2024 saw the emergence of a new swimming superstar as Leon Marchand became the first French athlete to take four individual golds at a single summer Olympics.   The 22-year-old hogged the headlines on home soil as he became only the third male swimmer ever to achieve the feat, after American greats Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz, and he added to his medal collection in the 4x100m medley relay with a bronze.  His five medals make him the joint most decorated athlete at the Games, along with fellow swimmers Mollie O'Callaghan from Australia and Torri Huske from the US. Away from the pool, Simone Biles was back to her brilliant best with A-listers Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman, Natalie Portman, Spike Lee, Tom Brady and Tom Cruise's presence underlining her status as the hottest ticket in town. Three triumphs - the all-around and vault titles, plus the team competition - took her career Olympic gold medal total to seven. The USA finished 47th when measuring medals by a size of population measure While the USA topped the official medals table, with population of just over 112,000, Grenada were actually the most successful nation when it comes to winning Olympics medals based on the size of their nation.  Anderson Peters and Lindon Victor's bronze medals in both the men's javelin and decathlon meant they averaged one medal per 56,289 inhabitants. Dominica, Saint Lucia and New Zealand, who averaged one medal per 266,945 of their population, make up the top four. Meanwhile Ireland were 18th, with Great Britain in 24th, the USA in 47th and China in 74th, while medal-starved India were bottom of the table averaging one medal per 234,151,666. India sent a contingent of 117 athletes to Paris, yet had a meagre haul of five bronze medals and a solitary silver to show for their efforts. They were also one of 28 teams that failed to win a gold in any sport. One of the big changes in the medal table was the absence of Russia, who have historically always been among the top four medal-winning countries and among the largest contingents. But the country was banned from these Games following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with its ally Belarus also barred. Instead, a handful of athletes from the countries (15 from Russia, 17 from Belarus) were invited to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) without national flags or anthems. They had to meet strict criteria over their eligibility - they had to pass background checks to make sure they did not actively support the war and were not contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies. Medals were won in five events by AINs but these are not being counted in the official medal table. Just one medal ceremony featured the specially composed anthem for AIN gold-medal winners. Belarusians won medals in two trampoline events (Ivan Litvinovich - men's gold, Viyaleta Bardzilouskaya - women's silver), one in rowing (Yauheni Zalaty - silver) and one in weightlifting (Yauheni Tsikhantsou - bronze). The only medal won by Russians was a silver for tennis players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the women's doubles. At all Olympic Games, medals are decided by the finest of margins. That has been particularly true in Paris with Noah Lyles claiming a stunning 100m gold by virtue of thrusting his torso out over the line first. However, in terms of winning margin (either in terms of times/points) that was not the smallest when worked out as a percentage of the winning time or points total. It wasnât even the closest on the track, with the womenâs 10,000m, won by Kenyaâs Beatrice Chebet, closer at just 0.005% of the overall time. Great Britainâs photo-finish win over the Netherlands in the womenâs quadruple sculls rowing was by a finer margin too, as were Adam Peaty and Matt Richardsâ silvers in the pool. However, the closest of them all was the menâs horizontal bar gymnastics final, where Japanâs Shinnosuke Oka and Colombiaâs Angel Barajas were barely inseparable. They both scored exactly 14.533 but the former won because of a higher execution score. This video can not be played Hodgkinson wins gold in women's 800m Keely Hodgkinson's superb 800m gold was one of the moments of the Games for Team GB, whose 10 medals on the track was their best tally at an Olympics since 1984 when they won 16 including golds for Sebastian Coe, Daley Thompson and Tessa Sanderson. Alex Yee produced a sensational sprint finish to top the podium in the men's triathlon and trampoline gold for Bryony Page crowned two decades of commitment to her craft, while Ellie Aldridge delivered an exhilarating kitesurfing success.  Lewis Richardson ensured the British boxing team did not walk away empty handed by earning a bronze after all five of his teammates were beaten in their first bouts. Tom Pidcock also defied a puncture to retain his Olympic mountain bike title as GB claimed medals in 19 different sports. Of Team GB's 14 gold medals, six each came in men's and women's events and two in mixed equestrian events, where male and female riders compete together - although the team jumping was won by an all-male trio of Scott Brash, Harry Charles and Ben Maher."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwyy9j8wxdo,"Angered by Paris ban, Russia's media scorns 'the Olympics of Hell'",Most Russian athletes are not allowed to compete in Paris due to their country's war in Ukraine.,5 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:36.966385,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"I’m sailing down the river with an Olympic champion. No, it’s not the Seine. And this isn’t Paris. That’s clear when we cruise past the Kremlin. Below deck, Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Mariya Lasitskene is taking part in the launch of an unusual project: a fusion athletics-fashion show-music event. Mariya is not in Paris defending her Olympic high jump title. Team Russia is barred from these Games because of the war in Ukraine. A World Athletics ruling means that track and field stars from Russia aren’t even allowed to compete as neutral athletes. And, for Mariya, that hurts. “I can’t even bring myself to follow the athletics at these Olympic Games,” she tells me. “It’s too painful. We should be there. The Olympics are a festival, the greatest event in the world.” The Russian press doesn’t seem to think so. From the get-go, newspapers here have been pouring cold water on Paris 2024.  After an opening ceremony featuring drag artists and what some saw as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets dubbed the Paris Olympics ""The Games of Satan"". Another outlet, Argumenty i Fakty, has called them ""The Olympics of hell"". It’s starting to feel like Russia could win the gold... for sour grapes. “I thought the Olympic Games were about sport. No longer,” Russian MP Mariya Butina tells me.  “It’s about politics, religion, everything. It’s very sad because the original idea of the Olympics was to create peace.” “But Russia has invaded Ukraine,” I point out. “That’s not ‘peace’, is it?” “Russia has been protecting its people,” Ms Butina responds, echoing the official line here that Russia’s war in Ukraine is all about self-defence.  In reality, the Kremlin’s ""special military operation"" amounts to the invasion of a sovereign independent nation. In Russia, there was always huge interest in the Olympic Games. But these Olympics are not even being shown on TV here. That hasn’t happened since the Soviet Union boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics 40 years ago. Russia used to send hundreds of athletes to the Summer Games. This time round only 15 Russians have been competing in Paris as ""neutral athletes"" in sports like canoeing and tennis.  They’re not allowed to present themselves a national team, so no Russian flags, no national anthem. And the individual athletes have had to undergo a vetting procedure to establish they have no links to the Russian military or security agencies and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. Bans in sport are nothing new for Russia.  In 2019, the country was barred from major international sporting events for state-sponsored doping offences. That suspension was later reduced to two years. At the Tokyo Games, Russian athletes competed under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. There’s no vetting process at the sports festival I’m witnessing in a Moscow park. A Russian nationalist group has organised an afternoon of what it’s presenting as traditional Russian recreations. It is a world away from Paris 2024. I can see two men lying on the ground engaged in ""stick wrestling"", straining to pull their opponent over. What looks more like a gang fight is raging over on the football pitch, with teams in red and blue bibs engaged in ""wall-to-wall fighting"". Some things here have nothing in common with sport at all. Over in one corner, Russians, young and old, are being invited to don army fatigues and military gear. Posing with guns, they’re having their photographs taken. I detect little interest here in what is going on in Paris. “I haven’t followed the Olympics for ages,” wall-to-wall fighter Vadim tells me. “Not since Russia was excluded from it. Russia’s being cancelled everywhere.” For now, high jumper Mariya Lasitskene has her athletics-fashion show-music event to keep her busy. But Mariya concedes the Olympics are “every professional athlete’s dream"". “Every athlete wants to compete with the best. You can only do that at international competitions,” Mariya tells me.  “Sport is the battle of the strongest. I do miss it.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxllqlz9ezo,'What we saw happen in our city is appalling',Participants from different communities in Belfast come together to play traditional Irish music.,7 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:37.058517,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“What we saw happen in our city is appalling, and it does not represent the best of Belfast.” Susan Curran joined about 30 people from 14 different nationalities to play Irish traditional music in Belfast on Tuesday. One of the musicians was Sam Ali, a refugee from Sudan.  He plays the bodhrán in the group, but his drum was destroyed during the violence over the weekend. “I think it’s wrong what happened and I don’t know who did that, but there is still a lot of good people,"" he said. “My country was not safe, a lot of war, Northern Ireland is better, its safe here."" Sam had left it in a café owned by a friend which was set alight on Saturday night during violent protests. Rioting broke out after an anti-immigration protest in the city. To make sure he was still able to play at the event, Sam was bought a new bodhrán by it's organiser Catherine Crean. “I lost family, country and everything, and I feel now Northern Ireland is my country and I don’t know where I would go,"" added Sam. ""I think I will stay here."" The Tunes Translated Project helps people get to know each other through music. The idea was sparked by Catherine Crean whose university research looked at how traditional Irish music can help with integration. They play music from Ireland, Sudan, Somalia, Ukraine and Iran.  Catherine said some musicians in the group were too frightened to attend the performance on Tuesday. “One participant had to leave Belfast all together because they were threatened,” she added. She also said only half of the audience turned up because some participants' family members were too worried about coming together in large groups. “A lot of them are afraid and are thinking if they need to move house or change their job,"" said Susan Curran. “I thought this was important because it was inclusive, safe and positive. ""We were learning together and then I saw what happened over the weekend and I think it's even more important now."" The group was also due to attend another event on Tuesday night, but Catherine said many participants pulled out. “I did say we are going together. We are with you. You are safe, but at the same time, I can’t guarantee that,” Catherine said. But despite the disorder over the last few days, Catherine believes events like this can show communities that everyone is welcome. “I would like to think that this event is the antithesis of the horrible scenes we saw. They are real people just like us.” she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg55g4z526o,Russian dissident tells BBC he thought he would die in 'Putin's prison',His joy at his release in the prisoner swap is marred by thoughts of Russian detainees still in jail.,5 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:37.138264,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“I was absolutely certain I would die in Putin’s prison.” It’s almost the first thing Vladimir Kara-Murza tells me after his surprise release in the biggest prisoner exchange since the Cold War. The Russian opposition politician is painfully thin – from stress, he says. He’s also still reeling from his abrupt transfer from a high security jail in Siberia into forced exile, after more than two years behind bars. “It’s surreal, like I’m watching a film,” he describes the feeling. “But it’s a good film,” in which he’s finally been reunited with the family he hasn’t seen since his arrest in Moscow in April 2022. His youngest son has been following him everywhere, anxious not to let him out of his sight. Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is also a British citizen, was convicted of treason and sentenced to 25 years for his fierce and persistent condemnation of Vladimir Putin and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He has spent the past 11 months straight in solitary confinement, made to fold away his bed each morning at 05:00 and only given paper and pen for an hour or so each day. “It’s so easy to lose your mind. You lose sense of time, space. Everything really,” he reveals, in one of his first long interviews since release. “You do nothing, speak to no one, go nowhere. Day after day after day.” He was denied phone calls home, only allowed to speak to his children twice in over two years. The added punishment was even tougher, physically. Almost a decade ago, Vladimir Kara-Murza nearly died from an unknown toxin and still suffers from after-effects, including nerve damage. In September, he now reveals, a prison doctor gave him ""a year, 18 months at best"" to live, if he stayed behind bars. “After two FSB poisonings, I don’t exactly have the right state of health for a strict regime prison,” he explains, with a wry smile.  Last week, Kara-Murza was one of eight Russian dissidents who went missing from their prisons. As lawyers and relatives sounded the alarm, rumours of a looming swap began to swirl. The prisoners themselves had no idea. Instead, when guards burst into Kara-Murza’s cell in Omsk he thought he would be “led out to be shot”, he recalls. “I actually thought they were going to execute me.” He’d recently been instructed to sign a request for a presidential pardon but refused to beg for mercy from Vladimir Putin, who he denounces as “a dictator, usurper and a murderer”. Kara-Murza was transferred to Moscow and the notorious Lefortovo FSB jail. Five days later he was led out to board a bus and saw the other dissidents inside, each one with an FSB guard in a balaclava. Another guard then took the bus microphone and announced they were being taken for a prisoner swap, no details. “No-one asked our consent,” Kara-Murza says. “We were loaded onto a plane like cattle and flown out.” The activist landed in Germany in the only civilian clothes he owned: black long-johns and T-shirt, and the flip flops he used for the prison shower. The Russian dissidents were part of a ""bundle"" of political prisoners released, along with high-profile US nationals like the journalist Evan Gershkovich. Three were former activists from the team of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who died suddenly in prison earlier this year. Originally, Navalny was to be part of the complex swap. In return for the dissidents, Russia got a handful of spies and criminals including the key prize sought by Vladimir Putin: an FSB hitman known as Vadim Krasikov who’d murdered in broad daylight in a Berlin park. The judge sentencing him to life in prison had called the killing an act of ""state terrorism"". “To everyone who criticises this [swap], I would respectfully urge them not to think of prisoner exchanges but of saving lives,” Kara-Murza argues, in response to the controversy over freeing Krasikov. The killer was welcomed home to a red carpet and a hug from Putin himself. “Aren’t 16 lives worth releasing one murderer?” For a long time, Germany wasn’t sure. The delay, Kara-Murza argues, may be what cost Alexei Navalny his life. The joy of the Kara-Murzas’ reunion is marred by thoughts of the Russian detainees who were not released. “I’m so happy and overwhelmed to see these people free, but also very sad so many people were left behind,” his wife Evgenia tells me. “I feel guilty.” Memorial human rights organisation lists hundreds of political prisoners and she had been campaigning hard for a priority group. “There are people with serious medical conditions, like Alexei Gorinov who’s missing part of his lung, who don’t have a lot of time.” Her husband talks of those ""still languishing in Putin’s Gulag"" and the hope of further exchanges. He had only been free himself for five minutes, when he strayed into controversy. In statements made soon after landing in Germany, Vladimir Kara-Murza argued that sanctions in relation to the Ukraine war should be better targeted.  There was immediate uproar from Ukrainians who claimed his priority on walking free was to soften Russia’s punishment for waging war. Kara-Murza calls it calibration. “I need more information,” he admits. “I realise that February 2022 changed a lot.” But he wants to know why a Russian human rights lawyer can’t travel to the Baltic states for a conference, when a Russian missile containing a Western-made chip can slam into a residential building in Ukraine. “The responsibility for what the Putin regime is doing there is shared by Russian society, a large part of which chose to close their eyes to the abuses and repression,” he argues. “But let’s not forget the responsibility of those Western countries who for years preferred to deal with Vladimir Putin and do business, knowing full well who he was and what he represented.” In 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was arrested because he insisted on being inside Russia and speaking out. Now he’s barred from travelling, he worries about his right to call others there to action. He thinks he’ll feel ""more constrained"". But he will continue condemning the war on Ukraine. “Putin can’t be allowed to win this war. Ukraine must win, and there should be more support from Western countries so that happens,” he argues. Historically, he says, ""windows of opportunity"" for democratic change open after ""disastrous military defeat"". When his plane out of Russia was taking off, the FSB guard next to Kara-Murza told him to look out of the window. “He said it was the last time I was seeing my motherland.” The activist laughed. “I said, I’m a historian, so I am sure I will be back in my country.” “And it will be much quicker than you think.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/clygvj8gj1yo,How did Team GB win their Olympic medals?,Team GB beat their Tokyo medal tally but only finished seventh in the medal table. Success or backwards step - what do the stats say?,12 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:37.219722,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"This video can not be played Olympics 2024: Every Team GB Olympic medal in Paris Let the celebrations begin - Team Great Britain have finished Paris 2024 with 65 medals, beating their total from Tokyo by one. The total matches the team's medal haul from London 2012 and is the joint-third-highest for Team GB at a single Games behind Rio 2016 (67 medals) and London 1908 (146). But GB did get eight fewer golds than they did three years ago in Tokyo. In fact 14 golds was only good enough for seventh in the medal table, GB's lowest placing since Athens 2004. This is because the official medal table is ordered by golds won. So, was Paris 2024 a record-breaking Games or a backwards step? Let's go through the stats.   British fans have been spoiled at recent Games. Third in London, second in Rio and fourth in Tokyo. Seventh almost feels like a disappointment. But if we change the table from most golds to total medals won, things suddenly look much better. And there is a precedent. The US media have been presenting Olympic medal tables this way for years.  Below is BBC Sport's official medal table from the Paris 2024 ordered by golds. Then take a look at what it looks like in the US media...   Team GB move up to third on the total medals table of broadcaster NBC Plus, GB coming home with 14 golds would have been unthinkable 28 years ago. Sir Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent won the rowing men's coxless pair at Atlanta 1996 for GB's only gold, in case you were wondering. On medals won it was cycling, but on golds alone rowing was Team GB's best sport at Paris 2024. Rowing last topped GB's medal table at Atlanta, but has joined cycling in number one. With equestrian being GB's third-best sport based on golds, Paris was the Olympics for sports which required British athletes to be sitting down. Money talks. UK Sport awarded Â£245,837,685 of funding for the Paris Olympic cycle. It means each GB medal cost, on average, Â£3,782,118. Cycling received Â£29,314,683, the most funding for any sport, followed by rowing (Â£23,794,482) and sailing (Â£22,800,520). Hockey (Â£13,689,907) had the most funding of any sport in which GB did not win a medal in Paris. UK Sport - funded by the government and National Lottery income - does not give Olympic funding to golf, making Tommy Fleetwood's silver GB's cheapest medal. The next cheapest medal was Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe's silver in the artistic swimming women's duet. Artistic swimming received just Â£467,250 from UK Sport. If we go by place of birth London was Britain's best source of medals with 32, just short of Germany's total of 33. The South East of England contributed 21, the West Midlands 14 and the North West of England and Yorkshire were locked together on 12. Yorkshire was briefly and famously above Australia in the London 2012 medal table. No such luck this time but a dozen medals was still the equal of Ukraine and one more than Sweden. Scotland took home 10, the same as Belgium, Wales seven like Croatia and Northern Ireland four, joining Portugal on that haul. Of course! In the battle of the sexes British male athletes won 31 medals, with female athletes winning 30. Four of GB's medals were in mixed events. The average age of British medallists was 27 years and three months. The youngest winner was 16-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown. The oldest was 57-year-old dressage rider Carl Hester. Thanks to McEwan, Pidcock, Dean, Digby, Ford, Daley, George and Fleetwood the most common first name for a GB medallist was Thomas. So, if you are a 23-year-old male rower living in London called Tom - get training now. You are our best hope for Los Angeles 2028!

Charlotte Gerada, leader of the Labour group on Portsmouth City Council, suggested the official link with Valletta to the authority's twinning advisory group. She said there were already ""strong links"" between the two maritime cities. Portsmouth also has an active Maltese community which organises local cultural events. The practice of twinning, or sister cities, was introduced after World War Two to promote diplomacy along with cultural and commercial ties. Ms Gerada, who is of Maltese descent, mentioned that hundreds of Maltese people moved to Portsmouth in the late 1970s for work in the dockyard, including her grandfather. With many Royal Navy personnel either having been posted to Malta or having trained there, Ms Gerada said: “If you have anything to do with the navy or the maritime industry, then Malta is renowned.” She also highlighted further similarities, noting that both cities feature historical fortifications, boast island locations, and have populations that share “enterprising” and “outward-looking” attitudes toward life. The lord mayor, Jason Fazackarley, has agreed to host a flag-raising ceremony on 21 September to celebrate Malta’s Independence Day. Councillors recently met to discuss other twinning proposals, including with Berehomet in Ukraine, two port cities in Turkey, and Jericho in Palestine. Portsmouth is already twinned with Caen in France, Duisburg in Germany, Haifa in Israel, and Sydney in Australia, along with other cities in China, Japan, Bangladesh, and Canada.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm23m3zx111o,New Turkish-built CalMac ferry delayed by two months,The Turkish built MV Isle of Islay has been delayed from an October completion until the end of 2024.,9 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:37.392045,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The first of four new CalMac ferries being built by a shipyard in Turkey will be delivered late. MV Isle of Islay had been expected to be handed over in mid October – but this has been put back to near the end of the year. The Cemre shipyard blamed delays in delivery of equipment and materials, due to global supply chain difficulties. The announcement comes at a difficult time for CalMac with two of its 10 major vessels currently out of action and a third due to be retired in November. Another ferry, the much-delayed Glen Sannox, being built by the Ferguson shipyard, will not be handed over until late September and will require several weeks of crew familiarisation before it comes into service. News of the problems with delivery of the Turkish ferry came in a letter to MSPs from Kevin Hobbs, chief executive of the government-owned ferries procurement company CMAL. In the letter, Mr Hobbs said: ""There have been major challenges the yard has had to overcome in the programme; the war in Ukraine affecting the supply of steel, the devastating earthquakes in south-eastern Turkey, which led to a serious loss of manpower in the shipyard, with many of the workers in the yard and subcontractors travelling to the region to assist in the rescue operations. ""I can report the quality of the workmanship and construction of the vessel is fully meeting requirements, with high levels of activity, supervision, engineering and co-ordination. ""The relationship between CMAL, CalMac and Cemre is strong and we are working together every day to achieve the ships that will serve Island communities for many years to come."" MV Isle of Islay - destined for the Islay route - is the first of the new Islay class vessels, with MV Loch Indaal due to follow next year and two other ships also on order. They are slightly smaller than the two ships being built at Ferguson’s, with conventional engines and some battery power. CalMac chief executive Duncan Mackison said: “Unfortunately, global supply chain issues are outwith every agency’s control and have caused a slight delay to what has otherwise been a faultless process.  ""CalMac crew for the new vessel are on-site at the shipyard to support the final stages of the build, and we stand ready to take delivery of MV Isle of Islay as soon as she is ready.” CalMac is continuing to face pressure maintaining its fleet, with many ships now beyond their expected service life.  The main Arran ferry Caledonian Isles has not been in service since February, and has been undergoing major steelwork repairs in Merseyside. That work has now been completed, but new repairs are being done to a bulkhead that was damaged when a ballast tank was over pressurised.   The ship could be back in service by the end of August but this could now slip to September.  Another major vessel, Lord of the Isles, which serves South Uist, is out of action after an engine fire on Tuesday.  The ship is due to arrive in Greenock on Friday afternoon where an assessment of the damage will be carried out.  A third major vessel, the 38-year-old Hebridean Isles, is due to be scrapped in November because it would require expensive and lengthy work to keep it in service.  The delivery date for Glen Sannox, being built at Ferguson’s and due to serve the Arran route,  has also been put back recently because of problems completing its LNG propulsion system, and will not be handed over until the end of September."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd074r6gxpo,Council pulls funds from firms linked to arms trade,"Waltham Forest Council says the decision to divest its pension funds is in line with its ""beliefs"".",9 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:37.474910,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A London council has said it will withdraw its pension investments in firms linked to arms producers. Labour-run Waltham Forest Council says £773,000 of its £1.1bn pension fund ""appears to be invested in companies that may derive some element of income from arms"". It says the decision is in line with its ""beliefs"" and it has updated its ""ethical investment policy"". Local campaign group Waltham Forest for a Free Palestine (WF4FP) has been calling for the council to take the action, known as ""divesting"", because of of Israel’s ongoing offensive in Gaza. Israel says it is defending itself, following the deadly attacks last October by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is proscribed by the UK government and others as a terrorist organisation. The decision was taken by the council's pensions committee, whose members act as trustees and have the job of deciding how the fund should be invested in the best interests of the scheme's members. The BBC understands the move is to include cutting financial ties with firms involved in supplying arms not only to Israel, but to any country. Its chair, councillor Johar Khan, said the north-east London authority had taken a responsibility to invest the fund ethically, which it took ""extremely seriously"". ""We work hard to balance this responsibility with the important task of ensuring the fund performs well and continues to support the people who rely on it,"" Mr Khan said.  The local authority told the BBC the decision to divest was subject to a ""robust definition"" of the term ""arms trade"", but this definition may become ""better refined as the sources of information become more comprehensive"". It said while a small portion of its pension fund was held in firms involved with producing arms in some way, the fund had ""zero investment"" in companies that had arms identified as their main source of income.  Mr Khan said: ""This is a complex task that will take some time, and we will keep the community and the pension fund recipients informed as we progress."" Waltham Forest said it would also encourage other councils in the capital to divest in this way, which would be done through the London Collective Investment Vehicle (LCIV), which manages pooled pension funds on councils' behalf. The decision was announced at a special meeting of the council's pensions committee, attended by members of WF4FP. They were invited to present a petition calling for the council to divest from firms the group believed were ""complicit"" in arms dealing. A spokesperson for WF4FP said the group was ""extremely pleased"" with the decision and hoped it would set a precedent with other London boroughs. Although Israel is a major weapons exporter, its military has been heavily reliant on imported aircraft, guided bombs and missiles for its campaign in Gaza.  Waltham Forest's decision follows calls on the UK government to halt weapons exports to Israel. The government says it is ""reviewing the advice"" on exports to Israel and ""no decision has been made"". The campaign group We Believe in Israel is calling for any such plans to be scrapped. Its executive director Catherine Perez-Shakdam said: ""Israel has an unequivocal right to self-defence, particularly in the face of threats from terror groups that the UK itself has proscribed. ""We fully acknowledge the concerns about civilian safety (in Gaza); however, the responsibility lies with Hamas, which continues to incite violence and endanger innocent lives.""  Many public bodies and private companies hold pension funds in firms that some consider to be unethical in some way. These include tobacco, gambling and alcohol firms, as well as arms.  Justin Wray, of the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, said: “Pension schemes have a significant interest in ensuring that the companies they invest in operate to high standards. Funds of all types will typically apply screening along environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles relevant to the types of investment strategy they offer."" “Where they are not happy with the actions of the company they may take the decision to divest,” he explained. However, he added that, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there had been ""renewed debate about the ethics of investing in arms manufacturers"". In April, the former Conservative government issued a joint statement with the Investment Authority, which said: ""Investing in defence companies contributes to our national security, defends the civil liberties we all enjoy, while delivering long-term returns for pensions funds and retail investors. ""Investing in good, high-quality, well-run defence companies is compatible with ESG considerations as long-term sustainable investment is about helping all sectors and all companies in the economy succeed."" Waltham Forest's decision has also been welcomed by national campaign group the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which believes many other local authorities have pension investments in firms linked to the arms trade. Its director Ben Jamal said the decision was a ""huge breakthrough"" in its campaign. ""We thank the councillors of Waltham Forest for standing on the right side of history,"" he said. ""We look forward to them putting this policy into action as soon as possible, and hope other councils around the country will quickly follow suit.” The PSC has previously reported 52 of the 86 Local Government Pension Scheme funds across England and Wales had investments totalling £1.1bn in firms supplying weapons or systems to Israel. This was based on data supplied under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, in 2021.  Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

""F-16s in Ukraine. We did it,"" President Zelensky said at a ceremony at an unnamed airbase, flanked by two of the planes. Ukraine’s leader thanked allies for what they were once very hesitant to provide - though he added that many more were needed. The arrival of the jets marks a crucial milestone in boosting the capabilities of Ukraine's air force, which largely relies on old Soviet-era jets. More F-16s are expected and hoped in the months ahead, though Mr Zelensky admitted that Ukraine does not yet have enough trained pilots to fly them all. He did not specify how many aircraft had arrived in Ukraine - or whether they had all been sent by Denmark, the Netherlands and the US, which he specifically thanked. Around 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023. The F-16 was introduced in 1978. Many Western militaries are in the process of retiring the ageing fighters, replacing them with the US-made F-35, introduced in 2015. The UK does not have any F-16s in its air force, though it is supplying long-range Storm Shadow missiles which can be fitted to the jets.  Ukraine's F-16s will work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and Nasams which are already on the ground. With their capacity to carry rockets, bombs and missiles, F-16s should in theory allow the air force to carry out more strikes deep inside occupied territory, and possibly on targets close to the border inside Russia. They may also help defend against Russian glide bombs - dumb munitions fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States. Around 3,000 were dropped in March alone, mostly from Su-34 fighter-bombers. If Ukraine can protect its F-16s on the ground, the hope is that they could play an important part in pushing back Russian aircraft to a point where they can no longer target Ukrainian ground forces with glide bombs. Kyiv had suggested that it could keep some F-16s at foreign military bases, but that suggestion prompted President Vladimir Putin to warn that any Western bases storing Ukrainian jets flying sorties against Russia would be legitimate military targets.  Experts also say the fighters could provide much needed air support to Ukrainian ground forces, who have faced relentless attacks in recent months, especially in the eastern Donbas region.  Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov previously vowed that Western-made F-16s flying for Ukraine would be ""shot down"".  ""But of course, these deliveries will not have any significant impact on the development of events on the front,"" he added. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y0j47xe4o,'They're tightening the screws': Kremlin ups attacks on critics abroad,"With dissent snuffed out at home, Russia intensifies attacks on opponents seeking refuge in the West.",4 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:43.748576,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Two plain-clothed UK police officers were waiting for Dmitry Gudkov as he arrived at London’s Luton Airport last summer. The Russian opposition politician, who lives in exile in an EU country, was flying to the UK to attend a friend’s birthday. “They were there to intercept me immediately after I exited the plane,” Dmitry says. “That had never happened to me before."" But the police weren’t arresting him – instead, they wanted to warn him. “They told me I’m on a list of people who are in danger. They asked where I’ll be staying and what phone I’ll be using.” Dmitry Gudkov is the co-founder of the Anti-War Committee, an organisation that co-ordinates efforts to oppose the war in Ukraine. He is wanted in Russia for ""spreading fakes"" about the Russian army. The start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to a wide-ranging crackdown against opponents inside Russia. Almost all activists and independent journalists fled the country. Now, a number of Kremlin critics living in Europe have told the BBC that Russia is stepping up its efforts to silence, threaten and persecute opponents abroad. Some were unwilling to share their stories publicly. The Russian embassy in London didn’t respond to a request for comment. Analyst Mark Galeotti, who studies the Russian security services, agrees that the campaign against Russia’s ""enemies"" abroad is intensifying. “I think it reflects the growing paranoia of the Kremlin,” he says, “that it is involved in an existential political struggle."" With all dissent snuffed out at home, Russia is turning its attention to opponents who have sought refuge in the West. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, described them as “traitors who have gone over to the enemy and want their Fatherland to perish”. Another anti-Kremlin activist was also contacted by British police. “They said they needed to discuss the safety of me and my family,” Ksenia Maximova tells me.  The founder of the Russian Democratic Society in London says the police advised her not to travel to certain countries where Russian agents operate more freely.  “[The Kremlin is] stepping up the campaign against ‘enemies’, that’s absolutely true,” she says, “They’re tightening the screws.”  She and her fellow campaigners have noticed an uptick in cyber attacks and attempts to infiltrate the group online. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for UK Counter Terrorism Policing said, “We have been open for some time now about the growing demand within our casework relating to countering state threats… We have been actively increasing resources dedicated to countering the activity of hostile states.”  In December, new UK legislation came into effect, giving police more powers to tackle threats from hostile states such as Russia. ""Parasites can’t sleep in peace..."" was one of the messages that investigative journalist Alesya Marokhovskaya received last year.  The threats were accompanied by the name of the street in Prague where she lived. “I moved house to make it harder for them,” says Alesya.  “We thought it may just be some crazy Czech guy who was pro-Putin and had recognised me on the street.” But then the messages became more sinister - calling her a ""scumbag"" and promising to find her ""wherever she walks her wheezing dog"".  Alesya’s dog really does wheeze when it walks. She informed the Czech police. Later, Alesya was due to fly to Sweden to attend a conference. The sender then sent even more specific threats: details of her flight, seat number and the hotel she had booked. “It was clear they had high-level access to documents,” Alesya says. “It looks like the behaviour of the Russian state.” Alesya had been branded a 'foreign agent’ years before by the Russian government, due to her work at independent Russian news website iStories. “When I left Russia and came to Prague, I had this illusion of security,” says Alesya. “Now I realise that [Russian intelligence services] can get their hands on people almost anywhere in Europe. I can’t say I’m not afraid, because I am."" But why is this happening now? Experts suggest the Russian security services are beginning to activate operations abroad after a period of turmoil. Hundreds of Russian diplomats believed to be intelligence agents operating under diplomatic cover were expelled from Western countries following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “There was a period of confusion after 2022,” says Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist who writes about the intelligence services. “In 2023, the agencies regrouped and found a new sense of purpose. They got resources and began increasing pressure.” Mark Galeotti says the authorities are increasingly turning to proxies to do their dirty work - criminal gangs: “If you want someone beaten up or even killed, they’re a lot easier to engage,” says Mr Galeotti, who has been writing about the links between the Russian state and organised crime for years.  “They’re going to be some thug – maybe someone whom the Russian-based organised crime groups have at some point dealt with.” The Polish government believes that’s what happened in the case of Leonid Volkov, a prominent activist and associate of the late Alexei Navalny. He was brutally attacked with a hammer in Lithuania four months ago, but survived.  The Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said a Belarusian man working for Russian intelligence had paid two Polish football hooligans to carry out the assault. All three have been arrested. “Intimidation is the intent,” suggests Mark Galeotti. “The idea that you'd better keep your head down. It’s a way of deterring the emergence of some kind of coherent political opposition [to the Kremlin].” The Russian authorities also try to make day-to-day life as difficult as possible for opponents abroad.  Activist Olesya Krivtsova, 21, escaped from Russia after being arrested and threatened with jail for anti-war posts on social media. She now lives in Norway, but recently discovered her Russian passport had been cancelled, meaning she can’t apply for travel documents.  “I think this is a new [method] of repression,” Olesya says. “They’re always thinking, how can we do more, how can we pressure them?” Several other activists living abroad have also had their passports cancelled without warning. Many have criminal cases open against them in Russia - without a valid passport, they cannot hire lawyers or make payments back home. The only way to resolve the issue is to return to Russia. For Olesya, returning would mean arrest and prison. She has now applied for a temporary Norwegian ID for refugees. “In Russia, now I only have one right – the right to go to prison. My passport is cancelled. This shows the essence of their cruelty,” says the young activist.  “They’ve already completely destroyed my life and the life of my family…They’re never going to stop.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nggvg1yggo,Ukraine says it sank Russian submarine in Crimea,Ukraine's military said it destroyed the Rostov-on-Don attack submarine in a missiles attack on Friday.,3 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:43.843587,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine's military says it attacked and destroyed a Russian submarine while it was anchored at a port in the occupied Crimean peninsula.  The Rostov-on-Don, a Kilo-class attack submarine launched in 2014, sank after it was struck in a missile attack on the port city of Sevastopol on Friday, Ukraine's general staff said in a statement.  It was reportedly one of four submarines operated by Russia's Black Sea fleet capable of launching Kalibr cruise missiles. The Russian defence ministry has not commented.  Officials in Kyiv said the attack also destroyed four S-400 air defence systems protecting the peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.  Intelligence officials in the UK noted last September that the Rostov-on-Don ""likely suffered catastrophic damage"" in a missile strike while undergoing maintenance at a Sevastopol shipyard.  Ukraine's military said Russia subsequently repaired the vessel and it was recently testing its capabilities near Sevastopol. The vessel was worth $300m (£233m), they added.  ""The destruction of Rostov-on-Don once again proves that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,"" the general staff in Kyiv said in a statement on Saturday.  It marks the latest attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol in recent months. In March alone, Ukraine said it hit two landing ships and a patrol vessel in the port city.  Since Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it has suffered several major naval setbacks. Ukraine says it has seriously damaged or sunk at least 15 warships, including the Black Sea fleet's flagship, the Moskva.  Last week Ukraine's military said Moscow had been forced to withdraw all of its naval assets from the Sea of Azov - a body of water connected to the Black Sea - due to repeated strikes on its vessels.  And Russia's internal security service, the FSB, recently said it foiled a Ukrainian plot to destroy its last remaining aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, launched in 1985, has been undergoing repairs since 2018.  Meanwhile, officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian drones targeted a major airfield and oil depots in Russia.  The attack targeted the Morozovsk airfield, where guided bombs which have recently wreaked havoc on Ukrainian cities, are stored.  Online footage said to be from the base showed powerful explosions and huge fires, after what appears to be several hits on fuel or ammunition depots. Russia said many of the drones used were shot down, but local authorities have declared a state of emergency around the air base. Oil storage facilities were also targeted in the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions.  The attacks come after Russia launched more than 600 guided air bombs towards Ukraine in a week, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.  He said that it was crucial that Ukraine stopped Russian aircraft from launching the munitions and said that attacking airfields in Russia to do so was ""quite fair"".  Ukraine's allies have previously been reluctant to allow it to strike within Russia using Western weapons, though the US has recently granted Kyiv permission to attack some targets along the border.  Earlier this week Lithuania's foreign minister said the first deliveries of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine. Long promised by Kyiv's Nato allies, President Zelenky views the planes as central to his country's air defence plans.  The Times newspaper reported that six jets donated by the Netherlands had arrived in the country, but Dutch defence officials declined to comment when approached by the BBC earlier this week.  Officials in Kyiv will also hope that the jets can help arrest Russian momentum on the frontlines. Moscow's forces have been making incremental gains in the east of the country for several weeks.  "

Valerii Kaluiev is responsible for helping create some of the most iconic monuments in his homeland, including the 100m (328ft) tall Mother Ukraine statue. Mr Kaluiev, 80, found refuge with his wife at his son Tamik’s home in Bury St Edmunds after fleeing Kyiv in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. He has now unveiled an exhibition at the town's Apex art gallery as a thank you to his new home. The artworks on display include a large series of sketches and paintings inspired by Ukraine’s plight, Great Britain, and Bury St Edmunds and its community. Mr Kaluiev is said to have been inspired by St Edmund and has even created a model for a proposed statue of the patron saint which is on display at Moyse’s Hall Museum. Tamik, 40, said his retired dad was inspired to pick up the paintbrush after realising his works could be decimated and erased from the landscapes of his homeland. “While travelling on the train from Kyiv, my father realised, as a result [of the war], there would be no creativity legacy left,” he said. “All he created through his life for people to enjoy could be destroyed but he refused to accept there will be nothing left and nobody will know his art anymore. “And then he started to paint and I could start to see there were quite a few paintings so I asked him what he wanted to do with them. “He said he’d love to share them with the people of Bury St Edmunds because everyone had been so welcoming and supportive of them.” The exhibition, entitled 'My World – Uncompromised: From Ukraine to UK, Through The Eyes Of An Artist', has been brought to life with the help of Bury St Edmunds Town Council, West Suffolk Council’s Heritage Service and The Apex. The Friends of Moyse’s Hall Museum group has also played its part, as well as Mayor Diane Hind and Ian Shipp, West Suffolk Council’s cabinet member for leisure. Mr Shipp said: “The war in Ukraine and the circumstances that have led to people having to flee their homes and their country is tragic. “Valerii and his family have been so welcomed with kindness and support here in west Suffolk that he wanted to give something back to the community. “I’m delighted that through this partnership we have been able to support him in putting on this free exhibition. I’d urge everyone to come along and experience it.” The free display will be available to view at The Apex, in Charter Square, Bury St Edmunds, until 18 August.

The trampoline gymnasts are two of the 17 Belarusians competing in Paris as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) because their country is banned owing to its support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has invited eligible athletes from the two countries to compete as AINs if they meet strict criteria, but they have no national flag, colours or anthem - and their medals will not be displayed in the table of nations. Among the conditions are that the athletes must not actively support the war and must not be contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies. Litvinovich, 23, successfully defended his title on Friday but - rather than hearing the Belarusian anthem that accompanied his flag on the podium in Tokyo - he listened to a song commissioned by the IOC with no lyrics, while the teal AIN flag was raised. He did, however, get a message of congratulations from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who wrote on his official website: ""Dear Ivan, you are our pride! Thank you for the Olympic gold."" Litvinovich was quick to shut down a question from a reporter asking him about his past support for Lukashenko, saying: ""Next question. I don't want to answer this. It's a provocation. Please, questions on sport."" He did, however, say the Belarusian anthem was ""much better"" than the AIN one, adding: ""Of course at the next Olympics I would like to compete under my own flag and anthem."" Litvinovich said everyone knows which country he is from and that ""nothing had changed"".   Bardzilouskaya, 19, had earlier taken silver behind Great Britain's Bryony Page in the women's trampoline. She received congratulations from the Belarusian Olympic Committee (BOC), which is not recognised by the IOC.  ""This is your first Olympic medal and the first medal for Belarus in Paris, so it is twice as valuable and special,"" its president Viktor Lukashenko - son of Alexander - said in comments carried on the BOC's website.  ""Your beautiful debut at the Games is impressive and admirable. You have given unforgettable emotions and joy to millions of Belarusian fans and our athletes."" Eligible Russian athletes are also competing as AINs and there is another AIN medal guaranteed at these Games after Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider reached the women's doubles tennis final. They are two of the 15 Russians competing in Paris. The IOC initially banned Russian and Belarusian athletes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But it later decided athletes from the two countries would be able to participate as neutrals if they met strict eligibility conditions, saying that letting individuals take part was about ""respecting human rights"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last year that allowing Russia to compete at the Olympics would amount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable"", adding there was no neutrality in sport while his country's athletes were dying on the battlefield. It is the fourth successive Olympics where Russians are competing under an acronym. Before its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was already being sanctioned on the international sporting stage for a state-sponsored doping scandal.

William Lewis, from Coldharbour, says all the 30-50 cars on his property at any one time will have a purpose, whether taking soldiers to the front line, bringing injured soldiers back, or transporting medical professionals between hospitals. But because his land is designated for agricultural use, he is accused of breaking planning permission guidelines and faced a £1,000 fine, if he did not provide information to the council. Mole Valley District Council (MVDC) said there had been ""several complaints from local residents"" about cars being stored in the field near Dorking. Mr Lewis told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""Every vehicle that goes is going to be saving a life in war."" He has taken seven trips into Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022, taking humanitarian aid and delivering several ambulances, as well as raising funds to buy 180 generators for the country. Describing the council's behaviour as “outrageous and unsympathetic”, he says: ""Nobody is inconvenienced, they’re not an eyesore."" In February 2024, the Mayor of London and the charity British Ukrainian Aid (BUA) signed an agreement allowing owners of non-ULEZ compliant vehicles to donate their cars to humanitarian efforts.  Margaret Cooksey, cabinet member for planning at the council, said there had been complaints about ""an excessive number of cars being stored in a field"". She added: “If a valid planning application is not submitted, and vehicles remain on the land after 31 August, 2024, MVDC would have to consider whether to take formal planning enforcement action.” Follow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

Air defence systems shot down 89 Iranian-designed explosive drones and another missile overnight, the Ukrainian air force said on Wednesday. The capital Kyiv was the main target of the attack. Buildings in the region were damaged by falling debris but there were no reports of casualties. The attack comes more than 29 months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Almost daily bombardments have put the country's air defences under considerable strain. Russia insists it is targeting military and energy sites, but strikes on residential areas are frequent. Early on Wednesday the air force said it had ""withstood and repelled a massive attack"" by Iranian-designed Shahed drones. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later said on Telegram: ""Ukrainians can fully protect their skies from Russian strikes when they have sufficient supplies."" He added: ""The same level of defence is needed against Russian missiles and the occupier's combat aircraft."" Mr Zelensky repeated calls for allies to speed up deliveries of the air defence systems Ukraine relies on, particularly US-made Patriots. ""We need sufficiently courageous decisions from our partners - enough air defence systems, enough range,"" he said. Ukraine continues to strike back. Its military said on Wednesday that it had hit a weapons depot in the Russian region of Kursk. The local governor said a ""facility"" had been hit overnight, causing a fire, but did not provide further detail. Meanwhile, Moscow's slow-moving advance into Ukrainian territory is grinding on.  Russian forces made small but incremental gains in July, reportedly capturing eight villages in north-east, eastern and southern Ukraine in July. These were said to include Pishchane Nizhne in the Karkhiv region,  Vovche, Ivano-Daryivka and Pivdenne in Donetsk, as well as Rozivka near Zaporizhzhia. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjwexqj11xo,Who are the prisoners in the Russia-West swap?,The prisoner exchange between Russia and Western countries is the biggest since the Cold War.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:50.933881,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The US has confirmed 24 people were involved in a prisoner exchange between Russia and some Western countries including the US and Germany. Among the prisoners released are the US citizens Evan Gershkovich - a Wall Street Journal reporter - and former US Marine Paul Whelan. As part of the deal, Russian security service hitman Vadim Krasikov has been freed by Germany. There had been speculation for days about a major swap between Russia and Western countries, which was heightened after several prisoners were moved from their prison cells in Russian jails to unknown locations. US journalist Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a high-security penal colony earlier this month after being convicted on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter was first arrested by security services last March while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), accusations that Mr Gershkovich, the WSJ and the US government vociferously deny. It marked the first conviction of a US journalist for espionage in Russia since the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago. After his initial arrest, he was held in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison. Paul Whelan, 54, was given a 16-year jail sentence in 2020 after being arrested in Moscow on suspicion of spying in 2018. The ex-US Marine is a citizen of four countries - the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland. His lawyer said he was being held in a prison in the Mordovia region. After being discharged from the military in 2008 for bad conduct, he became a security consultant and started to travel back and forth to Russia for work. In December 2018, he was arrested by Russia's FSB state security agency, which claimed he had been ""caught spying"" in Moscow. His family has always denied the charges. On the same day Mr Gershkovich was convicted, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in a medium-security prison after a secret trial.  She was an editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,  which is funded by the US government, and was convicted of spreading false information about the Russian military. Her husband, Pavel Butorin, previously said she was arrested over a book published last year, which was a collection of stories about Russians opposed to the war in Ukraine. Ms Kurmasheva holds US and Russian citizenship and lived in Prague with her husband and two daughters. She was detained in June 2023 while visiting her mother in Russia. Vladimir Kara-Murza is a prominent Russian dissident, one of the most vocal opponents of the Putin regime, and an outspoken critic of the war in Ukraine and the internal crackdown on dissent in Russia. In 2023, the 42-year-old was sentenced to 25 years in prison for spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". Mr Kara-Murza - a former journalist and politician - denied all the charges. The dual British-Russian citizen had spent his term in a prison colony in Siberia, where his wife said he developed a neurological condition as a result of being poisoned.  One of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, Ilya Yashin was jailed in 2022 for ""spreading fake news"" about the country's military. He was arrested after he condemned suspected Russian war crimes in Bucha. Following the death of former opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison, Mr Yashin said he feared for his life. He previously accused President Vladimir Putin of going “mad with power” in a series of letters from the prison in the western Smolensk region where he was being held. Oleg Orlov is a Russian human rights activist who was jailed in February for calling Russia a fascist state and criticising the war in Ukraine. He was previously the chair of the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Memorial. The 71-year-old was handed a two-and-a-half-year term for ""repeatedly discrediting"" the Russian armed forces.  In an appeal aginst his sentence in July, he compared the Russian justice system to that of Nazi Germany. His sentencing followed a retrial. In the original trial in October last year, he received a 150,000-rouble fine (£1,290; $1,630) and walked free from the court. His later conviction marked a hardening of repressions against opponents of the war. Lilia Chanysheva was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison earlier this year after being accused of extremism by authorities. She had served as a local co-ordinator with the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption network. She was initially sentenced to seven years in 2023, but prosecutors appealed against the sentence and told officials it was too lenient. She was most recently held at a centre in the Perm region. Ms Chanysheva was the first of Mr Navalny’s allies sentenced on the charge. Most of his other activists have fled Russia into exile. Ksenia Fadeyeva was sentenced to nine years in prison by authorities after she was accused of organising an extremist group. She had been a local organiser with Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation in the Siberian city of Tomsk, where she was subsequently detained. Her lawyers argued that she had ended her association with the organisation before it was designated an extremist group in 2021. Most of Mr Navalny’s former staff and allies have been forced to flee Russia into exile in recent years, as the Kremlin has ramped up repression of opposition groups. Sasha Skochilenko was sentenced to seven years in a penal colony for replacing supermarket pricing labels with anti-war messages in November as a form of protest. The replacement labels drew attention to civilian deaths in Mariupol and said Russia had become a ""fascist state"". The artist from St Petersburg had been held in a detention centre in the city since April 2023. German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik was convicted of treason as a teenager, becoming the youngest person ever to be found guilty of the crime. He grew up in Germany and moved to Russia when he was 12. Authorities sentenced him to four years in prison last December for supposedly emailing pictures to “representatives of a foreign state” before and during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The court claimed he had visited and photographed “deployment sites” of Russian troops. German national Rico Krieger was accused of planting explosives in Belarus and sentenced to death, before being pardoned by the country’s leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week. In a heavily choreographed interview on state-controlled media, he said he was acting on instruction from Ukraine, but no evidence was given. He is believed to have been the first Western citizen ever to be given the death penalty in Belarus. Russian opposition activist Andrei Pivovarov headed the Open Russia foundation, which was established by former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison for campaigning against Mr Putin. He was arrested in 2021 after trying to leave the country from St Petersburg, accused of directing an “undesirable organisation”. In an interview for the Meduza website, his mother, who lives in the city, said she had been expecting him home in September when his sentence was due to end. She said he had called her from Germany and told her not to worry, adding: ""I don't know what happens next, but for now this is the best option."" Russian-German citizen Dieter Voronin was sentenced to 13 years in prison on ""treason"" charges after Moscow alleged he received classified military information from another journalist, Ivan Safronov, who remains behind bars, AFP reported. The 38-year-old German was detained in St Petersburg earlier this year after reportedly being found with a packet of cannabis gummy bears. He was accused of drug trafficking. Schoebel explained in court that he bought the bears in Germany last year and took them before long-haul flights to help him sleep. He said he didn't know they were banned in Russia. Russian-German immigration lawyer and cycling campaigner Mozhyes is facing treason charges after being arrested in May.  Little is known about his case, but human rights activists suggest the charges may be connected to his work in helping Russian citizens with European documents, or simply to his nationality. The Insider website describes a dramatic first attempt to arrest him as he was cycling in St Petersburg. Apparently he confused the manoeuvres made by the security forces' car to stop him with a case of bad driving and simply evaded capture. He was later detained outside his home and has spent the last few months in custody in Moscow's Lefortovo prison. Ostanin was the head of Alexei Navalny's regional branch in Barnaul, sentenced to nine years in jail in 2023. Like the other Navalny representatives in the swap, he was charged with belonging to an extremist organisation. In May of that year, while in custody awaiting trial, he said that his health was deteriorating because of his confinement. One of the most high-profile prisoners to be released back to Russia is Federal Security Service (FSB) agent Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 murder of an exiled Chechen commander in a Berlin park. During his trial, prosecutors said he was acting on orders from Russia, and that he belonged to a highly secretive Vympel unit of the FSB. Lawyers defending him insisted he was a construction worker, not a hitman. He denied being known as Krasikov, and identified himself as Vadim Sokolov, the name on the passport he was travelling with. In a recent interview with US talk show host Tucker Carlson, Mr Putin hinted his country was seeking “patriot” Krasikov’s release in exchange for US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Roman Seleznev was found guilty of running a hacking scheme in 2017 that caused $169m (£131m) in damages.  US officials said he stole credit card data from restaurants and sold it on the black market. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison for the scheme, which prosecutors say he ran between 2009 and 2013. According to the Justice Department, Mr Seleznev used software which enabled him to steal millions of credit card numbers from thousands of businesses. His father is Valery Seleznev, an MP and ally of Mr Putin. The US charged Vadim Konoshchenok with conspiracy related to procurement and money-laundering on behalf of the Russian government in 2022. He was also thought to have been an FSB agent. At the time, a statement from the US Department of Justice said he and others unlawfully purchased and exported highly sensitive electronic components, some of which can be used for military purposes. Husband and wife Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva were arrested and convicted on espionage charges in Slovenia.  They were each sentenced to 19 months in prison. Their two children also returned to Russia with them. University lecturer Mikhail Valeryevich Mikushin was charged with gathering intelligence in Norway on behalf of Russia in 2022 while posing as a Brazilian academic. Norwegian officials said he had a Brazilian passport and had worked as a researcher at the University of Tromso since 2021. He had reportedly been going by the name José Assis Giammaria. Mr Mikushin was also believed to have lied about his age, being in fact 44 rather than 37 when charged. Arrested in Switzerland at the request of the US authorities in 2021, Klyushin was jailed for nine years in 2023 for insider trading after refusing a plea deal. During the investigation, he was linked to former military intelligence officer Ivan Yermakov, who was allegedly involved in efforts to influence the 2016 US election in Donald Trump's favour. In Russia, the cybersecurity company he headed, M-13, was also responsible for the Katyusha programme, employed by the authorities to monitor media outlets and blogging sites. The Spanish-Russian journalist was arrested in Poland in February 2022, shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, accused of espionage and links to Russian military intelligence. Born Pavel Rubtsov in Moscow to descendants of Basque emigrees, he moved to Spain as a child and changed his name to Pablo González.  After his arrest, a campaign to free him was launched involving Amnesty International and Reporters without Borders (RSF). In a statement in February this year, RSF urged his release, noting that he still had not been charged by the Polish authorities.

Twenty-one youngsters from the war-torn country are among more than 4,500 children and teenagers at the event in Roxwell, near Chelmsford, until Saturday. Antonina Prudko said they had to collect their visas in Warsaw, Poland, before travelling by bus, train and plane to Essex. ""We are here and really happy to be here,"" she told the BBC. ""We managed to collect children from different Ukrainian cities and get here, far from danger. ""They are feeling more secure here and they have a very pleasant time meeting new friends and doing activities."" The first Essex county jamboree was held in Priory Park, Southend-on-Sea, in 1927 and was visited by the founder of the scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell. It has been a four-yearly event since then and in 1949 it was opened to international scouts for the first time. Eva, nine, was among the group who travelled from Ukraine to this year's jamboree. ""We can talk to people from other countries and we can make new friends,"" she said. ""I think this is really cool, it's the best idea."" During its time in Essex, the event has also been held at the county showground at Great Leighs and at Kirby-le-Soken, near Frinton-on-Sea. More than 40 countries have been represented at this year's event, which was pulled together by 1,500 adult volunteers. Joint-jamboree chief Paul Walker said it had a ""fantastically magical atmosphere"". ""They’re getting stuck in to being themselves for a week in a field and away from mums and dads - and having a great time,"" he added. ""They’re going to have memories for life here.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g2dx7d9wo,Americans freed in Russia prisoner swap reunite with families,US President Joe Biden welcomed them off the plane at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:51.123733,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Three Americans who were freed in a prisoner swap deal with Russia, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, have arrived back on US soil. Mr Gershkovich, 32, was one of 16 people swapped for eight Russian prisoners in what has been described as the biggest exchange since the end of the Cold War between Russia and the West. The exchange at an airfield in Turkey also included the release of former US marine Paul Whelan and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva. After touching down at Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, Mr Gershkovich, Ms Kurmasheva and Mr Whelan emerged from the jet to cheers from those on the tarmac. All three were greeted by US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris before they embraced their families. They lingered on the tarmac for photographs and conversations before leaving the air base within an hour, as did Mr Biden and Ms Harris's motorcades. Speaking ahead of their return, Mr Biden welcomed their release and declared: ""Their brutal ordeal is over."" He praised the role played by America's allies, particularly Germany and Slovenia, and hailed the release of Mr Whelan, Mr Gershkovich and Ms Kurmasheva, as well as leading Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, as a ""feat of diplomacy"". The three released Americans were then sent to the Brooke Army Medical Centre in Texas for a medical check-up.  The deal had been more than 18 months in the making and appears to have hinged on Moscow's demand for the return of Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for carrying out an assassination in a Berlin park. He is now back in Russia. Krasikov always maintained in captivity that the false identity he went under was real, but the Kremlin has admitted since his release that he was an agent with the FSB security service. In total, 24 people jailed in seven different countries were exchanged in Ankara, Turkey's presidency said. The prisoners were held in the US, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Russia and Belarus, it said in a statement. Ten people, including two minors, were relocated to Russia, 13 prisoners to Germany, and three to the US, the statement added. The eight prisoners who returned to Russia were serving sentences on a variety of criminal charges in the West. Charges against the 16 held in Russia and Belarus included espionage and treason, but were generally considered by Western governments and rights organisations to be politically motivated. Of the 13 staying in Germany, most either have German citizenship or are former Russian political prisoners.  The fate of the latter group seems unclear, as they have in effect been expelled from Russia. At least one of them, Ilya Yashin, has said in the past he did not want to be involved in a swap. Another, Andrei Pivovarov, was due to be released within Russia in September after completing his sentence, his mother told the Insider website in an interview. Oleg Orlov, 71, is a veteran Russian human rights campaigner and a founder of the long-standing and recently banned Memorial organisation. The 13 also seem to include Mr Kara-Murza, who has dual UK-Russian citizenship and is resident in the US. It is thought he may return to the US separately. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin personally greeted the Russians released from Western jails with bouquets of flowers at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport. He embraced them warmly on a red carpet and said they would be given state awards. Among those returned to Moscow in addition to Krasikov was a Russian couple, convicted of spying in Slovenia, who returned to Russia with their two children. German citizen Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus before being  pardoned by the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week, has also been released. Earlier prisoner swap discussions had included jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but the offer collapsed when he died in unclear circumstances in an Arctic penal colony in February. His widow Yulia Navalnaya welcomed the swap, describing it as a ""joy"". Three of the released dissidents were former regional leaders of Navalny's anti-corruption network, now branded extremist in Russia. Mr Yashin was also a close associate. The exchange comes after days of speculation about a major swap between various countries, which increased after several dissidents and journalists jailed in Russia were moved from their prison cells to unknown locations. Although secret prison transfers are common in Russia, the multiple disappearances of well-known prisoners was unusual. The last high-profile prisoner swap took place in December 2022, when US  basketball star Brittney Griner was exchanged on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi airport  for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in an American prison for 12 years. The last comparable one occurred in Vienna in 2010, when 10 Russian spies held in the US were swapped for four alleged double agents held in Russia. One of them was Sergei Skripal, a former military intelligence officer, later poisoned by nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018. Tensions between Moscow and the West have been high in recent years, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. And Chatham House expert James Nixey told the BBC that while this was a rare good day in relations and a victory for diplomacy, it should not be seen as Russia showing its ""softer side"". It merely showed that Russia was determined to get its own people back, whatever crimes they had committed, he said. ""From the Kremlin point of view, it merely confirms that hostage-taking and extortion is a successful tool in its wider geopolitical struggle,"" he added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880znzd4mmo,"Evan Gershkovich: Reporter, football fan, family man",The Wall Street Journal reporter will be freed in the largest prisoner swap between Russia and the West since the Cold War.,1 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:51.234026,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist jailed in Russia since the Cold War, has been released after more than 16 months in custody. The Wall Street Journal reporter was detained by Russia’s Federal Security Service in March 2023 while on a reporting assignment in Yekaterinburg, a city about 1,000 miles east of Moscow. Sentenced last month to 16 years in prison after being found guilty of espionage by a Russian court, he is now a part of the largest prisoner swap between Russia and the West since the Cold War.  Mr Gershkovich, his family, his employer and the US government have always maintained his innocence. Now 32 years old, the US citizen was born in Princeton, New Jersey, on 26 October 1991. He is the second child of Ella and Mikhail Gershkovich, Jewish immigrants who fled the Soviet Union in the late 1970s. Mr Gershkovich and his older sister, Danielle, grew up speaking Russian at home. A long-time football fan, he captained the team at his local high school and was known to be a dedicated fan of Arsenal. His flatmates from when he lived in Brooklyn, New York, have recalled since his incarceration that he would wake them up early in the morning on weekends to watch televised Arsenal matches - even if they had been out late the night before.  One friend, Jeremy Berke, recently described him to BBC Radio 4 as ""the most extroverted person that I've ever met in my whole life"".  In 2014, Mr Gershkovich graduated with degrees in English and philosophy from Bowdoin College, a prominent liberal arts college in Maine - a state in America's north-east. The budding young journalist first honed his reporting skills in college, writing for The Bowdoin Orient student newspaper as well as a separate student-run publication, The Bowdoin Review. He also disc-jockeyed at WBOR, the campus radio station. His first professional foray into journalism came in 2016, when he moved to New York and worked as a news assistant for The New York Times. He began to show his reporting chops and practise his Russian when he moved to Moscow and took a reporting job at The Moscow Times in 2017. The independent outlet - now blocked in Russia and designated a ""foreign agent"" by its government - is known for its hardnosed reporting, which often led to scoops that the rest of the Western press corps scrambled to match. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Gershkovich interviewed medical students forced to treat infected patients and statisticians who were concerned the state was fudging Russia's case numbers. Many of his fellow reporters in Russia quickly became his friends, including the BBC's Will Vernon and James Beardsworth. Everyone was ""impressed by his drive, his knowledge of Russia's language and culture, his ease at making contacts, and his willingness to go the extra mile"", the New Yorker's Joshua Yaffa writes. After a brief stint at the Agence France-Presse (AFP) wire service, he joined the Wall Street Journal in January 2022. A month later, Russia invaded Ukraine and a package of war-time censorship laws forced Mr Gershkovich and other reporters to flee the country, unsure of how to continue their work. The US citizen would arrange with the Journal to be based in London but go into Russia on assignment for two or three weeks at a time before returning to the UK. He travelled around the massive country with a valid Russian visa and proper journalistic accreditation, but was reportedly often followed during his visits.  His last Journal article, in March 2023, covered how the strain of a war entering its second year and the bite of Western sanctions had harmed the Russian economy. His ordeal began roughly two months later during his reporting trip to Yekaterinburg, a major Russian industrial hub. Russian authorities say the American was ""caught red-handed"" with ""classified information"" while reporting in the city. The Journal's editor-in-chief told the BBC earlier this year that is ""complete, total and utter nonsense"". Western politicians roundly condemned Russia when it found the journalist guilty of espionage last month and sentenced him to 16 years in prison.  US President Joe Biden said Mr Gershkovich had ""committed no crime"" and was ""targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American"". ""Evan has endured his ordeal with remarkable strength,"" Mr Biden added. Mr Gershkovich has sent and received letters from friends, family and supporters throughout his detention in Moscow's Lefortovo prison, where Russia has held high-profile political prisoners and dissidents since Tsarist times. Danielle Gershkovich has spoken of their correspondence as light and reassuring.  ""We have a lot of sibling banter back and forth, a lot of teasing with love,"" she told the BBC earlier this year. Her brother has even managed to surprise the family while locked away. ""On International Women's Day, he arranged for the women in his life to receive bouquets,"" she said. ""We want him to focus on himself and there he was taking care of us."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e1ygx7r1o,Biden burnishes his legacy with historic prisoner swap,The president is using his final months in office to take a victory lap after weeks of personal and political turmoil.,2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:51.338834,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Last month, President Joe Biden said that he had “no higher priority” than gaining the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. On Thursday night, after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, arm-twisting and manoeuvring, Mr Biden and his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, exchanged hugs with the two men as they set foot at last on American soil. For Mr Biden, it was a valedictory turn in the final months of his presidency. For Ms Harris - the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee - it was a chance to share the limelight of a foreign policy success. In one particularly powerful moment, Mr Biden removed the American flag pin he always wears on his suit jacket lapel and put it on Mr Whelan. It was a tangible sign of the task accomplished and a promise fulfilled. The multilateral exchange of 24 prisoners with Russia – the largest such swap since the Cold War – represents a significant feather in the cap of a man who abandoned his re-election bid less than two weeks ago. Like many in the waning days of their White House tenures, Mr Biden has found that foreign policy is one area where a president, even when sidelined from electoral politics, can make a splash. Typically, this focus abroad occurs at the end of a second term, when the incumbent is unburdened by a re-election campaign and domestic attention is on the party's new nominee. Mr Biden's circumstances are unusual. The nearest historical parallel in the modern era is when President Lyndon Baines Johnson stood down his re-election bid because of growing discontent with his handling of the Vietnam War. That war dominated Mr Johnson's final months in office – and represented his political undoing.  Mr Biden, on the other hand, has been able to take a victory lap with this prisoner swap, basking in the joy of families of the released Americans at the White House on Thursday, after more than a month of personal and political turmoil. Mr Biden's month of turmoil, which began with a catastrophic debate performance in late June, culminated in last week's Oval Office address to the nation, where he discussed his decision to drop his re-election campaign. While he conceded that it was time to ""pass the torch"", his speech included a reminder that his presidential term wasn’t over and that his work wasn't done. It came with a heavy serving of foreign policy promises. He said he would bring home detained Americans - which Thursday’s news significantly advanced. He also pledged to continue to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders - which recent congressional funding has guaranteed well into next year. And he said he would work to end the war in Gaza ""and bring peace and security to the Middle East"". On that last item, the news has been trending from bad to worse in recent days. Tensions in the Middle East have been escalating dramatically. Israel was allegedly behind the assassination of a prominent Hamas political leader in Iran on Wednesday.  The chances of a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have grown, as the two sides exchanged attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border. An Israeli strike on Tuesday killed a senior Hezbollah leader, as well as an Iranian military advisor. The US State Department has warned American citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon – reflecting the growing concern of a widening regional conflict. Mr Biden, who once chaired the Senate Foreign Relations committee and oversaw an international portfolio as Barack Obama's vice-president, touted his foreign policy chops as he campaigned for president in 2020. But the Middle East has proven to be a diplomatic graveyard for even the most capable US foreign policy hands. While achieving the kind of lasting ""peace and security"" Mr Biden envisions would become a remarkable accomplishment, it seems as far off now as any point since the war began nearly 10 months ago. While foreign policy successes could bolster Mr Biden's legacy, the president's place in the history books – and, in particular, how he is viewed by his members of his own party – hinges most directly on the fate of his chosen successor. Although Ms Harris was not with the president at the White House on Thursday afternoon, she joined the president in greeting the newly released prisoners as they returned to US soil. The White House also has been quick to credit the vice-president for playing a key role in negotiating details of the complex multilateral prisoner exchange with US allies. A senior Biden administration official told the BBC that Ms Harris' February meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia at the Munich Security Conference were particularly crucial. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential ticket has quickly attempted to minimise any political benefits from the prisoner swap – both by taking credit for it and by questioning its wisdom. During a rally in Arizona, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance said that the exchange was really a reflection of what he said was the increasing likelihood that Donald Trump would win in November. ""There's a real sense that the world leaders are afraid that if Donald Trump comes in, they’re going to have to start behaving again,"" he said. ""The bad guys worry that Donald Trump will be back and the free ride is over.” The former president himself posted a lengthy response on his social media website, questioning Mr Biden’s negotiating strategy and speculating about the details of the exchange. ""We never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps,"" he wrote. ""Our 'negotiators' are always an embarrassment to us!"" The Russian asking price for the release of Mr Gershkovich and Mr Whelan - along with Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and a group of Russian dissidents - was unquestionably high. It included Russian intelligence agents convicted of an assassination and espionage. But the president and his senior staff, in their remarks on Thursday, said the deal was worth it. Mr Biden also took a moment  to tout his foreign policy vision in what could be an implied contrast with the former president's ""America first"", go-it-alone international outlook. ""Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world and friends you can trust, work with and depend upon, especially on matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this,"" he said. ""Our alliances make our people safer."" It was a pointed message from a president whose opportunities to pull the national spotlight his way – and to burnish his legacy – are diminishing as the final days of his presidency tick away."

The White House said 16 prisoners had been freed and were on their way back to Europe and the US. Among them is Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.  In return, eight Russian prisoners have been released from prisons in the US, Norway, Germany, Poland and Slovenia, including individuals accused of intelligence activities. The children of two of the prisoners also returned to Russia. The swap took place on the runway at Ankara airport earlier on Thursday. President Joe Biden has confirmed US Marine veteran Paul Whelan, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and Russian-British activist Vladimir Kara-Murza - who has a US green card - are also on their way back to the US. The deal had been more than 18 months in the making and appears to have hinged on Moscow's demand for the return of Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence in Germany for carrying out an assassination in a Berlin park, and is now back in Russia. Senior US administration officials described him as a ""bad dude"" and said he was ""certainly the biggest fish the Russians wanted back"". Russian President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials, along with a guard of honour, met the returning Russians at Moscow's Vnukovo airport. Earlier prisoner swap discussions had included jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but the offer collapsed when he died in February. His widow Yulia welcomed the swap, describing it as a ""joy"".  ""Every released political prisoner is a huge victory and a reason to celebrate,"" she said in a post on X.  ""No one should be held hostage by Putin, subjected to torture, or left to die in his prisons."" The view in the White House is that this deal is the most complex exchange in US and Russian history. Mr Biden called it a ""feat of diplomacy"", adding that many countries had ""joined difficult, complex negotiations at my request and I personally thank them"". He added that those released had been convicted in ""show trials"" and sentenced to ""long prison terms with absolutely no legitimate reason whatsoever"". Mr Biden joined relatives of the three Americans and Kara-Murza on a call from the Oval Office after the exchange was completed. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he welcomed the releases, particularly of Kara-Murza and Whelan, who hold British citizenship. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said in a statement that 13 prisoners had been pardoned in order to secure the return of Russians held in prisons abroad. There was no explanation as to why the names of two of the released Germans, Patrick Schobel and Herman Moyzhes, were not included in the list of pardons.  German citizen Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus before being pardoned by the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko earlier this week, has also been released. Others included in the deal are Russian political prisoners Ilya Yashin and Oleg Orlov. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz insisted the swap was ""the right decision, and if you had any doubts, you will lose them after talking to those who are now free"". ""Many of the prisoners feared for their health and even their lives,"" he added after meeting with some prisoners on their arrival at Cologne Bonn Airport. Earlier, the Turkish presidency said prisoners from both sides of the deal were taken off aircraft at Ankara airport, moved to secure locations under the supervision of Turkish security officials and put on planes for their respective destination countries. It said 26 individuals were involved in the exchange. That figure included two children, who a US official confirmed returned to Russia with their parents Artyom Dultsev and Anna Dultseva - a Russian couple convicted of spying in Slovenia who are part of the exchange.

Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting will fight for gold on Friday and Saturday respectively. But last year they were disqualified from the World Championships. The body that oversaw that 2023 event is the International Boxing Association (IBA), and it says both fighters failed gender eligibility tests. On Monday the IBA held a news conference which it had said would provide a ""detailed explanation of the reasons for the disqualification"". However the chaotic media event left more questions than answers. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has cast doubt on the reliability of the tests and suggested what is happening is a ""sometimes politically motivated cultural war"". In June 2023, the IOC stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's amateur world governing body over concerns over how it was run. So, what is going on? IBA holds chaotic news conference on Olympic boxing row The IBA, formerly known as AIBA, was formed in 1946 as a worldwide governing body for amateur boxing. The IOC recognised the IBA as the sport's governing body until 2019. The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019. This was because of governance issues and alleged corruption. It led to the threat that boxing would be removed from the Olympics altogether from 2028. In 2018, the IBA issued life bans to ex-president CK Wu and former executive director Ho Kim after a report documented ""gross negligence and financial mismanagement of affairs and finances"".  Wu had been in charge for 11 years before being provisionally suspended in October 2017. Wu was replaced as AIBA president by Gafur Rakhimov, who was described by the US Treasury Department as ""one of Uzbekistan's leading criminals"". In 2020, Russian Umar Kremlev was elected president. In 2022, an independent investigation said boxing needed to take action on ethical issues to secure its Olympic future, having found a ""historical culture of bout manipulation"" - including at the 2016 Rio Games. In his final report, Professor Richard McLaren detailed decades of financial mismanagement and deception, rule-breaking in the ring, and inadequate training and education programmes for referees, judges and officials.  Kremlev pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the country's newly opened international boxing centre in September 2022 Kremlev is seen as having close ties to the Kremlin. Under his leadership, the IBA has had Russian state-backed energy giant Gazprom among its chief sponsors. In May 2022, Kremlev was re-elected unopposed after Dutch boxing federation president Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) later said Van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing, but a proposal to stage a new election was rejected by IBA delegates. The IOC said it was ""extremely concerned"" by the result, and Van der Vorst said he feared for the sport's Olympic future. The 2023 World Championships were held in two countries. The women's event was in India in March, and the men's in Uzbekistan in April and May. A total of 19 countries, including Great Britain and the USA, boycotted the events after the IBA allowed Russian and Belarusian boxers to compete under their countries' flags, contravening IOC guidance following the invasion of Ukraine. Kremlev said those boycotting the championships were ""worse than hyenas and jackals"" because of their violation of the ""integrity of sport and culture"". At the time, GB Boxing said of its decision to boycott the championships that the flag issues had ""put further distance between IBA and the Olympic movement in addition to the significant, longstanding issues over sporting integrity, governance, transparency and financial management which the IOC has asked IBA to address to protect boxing's place on the Olympic programme"". Russian athletes such as boxer Azalia Amineva are prevented from competing at Paris 2024 for their country. No Russian boxers are at the Games as neutral athletes. At the 2023 World Championships, Khelif was competing in the welterweight category and Lin at featherweight. Hours before Khelif's gold-medal match against Chinaâs Yang Liu, the IBA said the Algerian had failed a gender eligibility test. Khelif had beaten Janjaem Suwannapheng from Thailand in the semi-final, Uzbekistan's Navbakhor Khamidova in the quarter-final and Russia's Azalia Amineva in the round prior to that. As a result of Khelif's disqualification, 21-year-old Amineva had the only loss in her now 22-fight career removed from the record. At the same 2023 World Championships, Lin was stripped of a bronze medal by the IBA. The IBA said the fighters had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". The BBC has, as yet, been unable to determine what the eligibility tests consisted of. It is not known how tests were overseen. In an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan last Thursday, IBA chief executive Chris Roberts said male XY chromosomes were found in ""both cases"". Roberts said there were ""different strands involved in that"" and therefore the body could not commit to referring to the fighters as ""biologically male"". He said the unspecified eligibility tests had been conducted as a result of âongoing concernsâ raised by other fighters, coaches and the IBAâs medical committee. At Monday's media event Roberts said Khelif and Lin were first tested at the 2022 World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey but no action was taken as the results were ""inconclusive"". Of the fighters' 2023 disqualifications, he said: ""The results of the chromosome tests demonstrated both boxers were ineligible."" But while Roberts said the pair had ""chromosome tests"", Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests were to determine the fighters' testosterone levels. Testosterone is a hormone that can increase muscle mass and strength. Chromosomes carry genetic information including a personâs sex. ""We got the test results that they allowed us to make and these test results show they have high levels of testosterone, like men, said Kremlev. He added that if boxers ""want to prove they were born women, they have to do it by themselves"". The IBA said the tests were sent to two different laboratories that are accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). However, Wada has told BBC Sport it does not oversee gender tests and its work only relates to anti-doping matters. The IOC has previously raised doubts over the accuracy of the tests. ""We don't know what the protocol was, we don't know whether the test was accurate, we don't know whether we should believe the test,"" said IOC spokesperson Mark Adams. ""There's a difference between a test taking place and whether we accept the accuracy or even the protocol of the test."" This video can not be played Imane Khelif: IOC responds to boxing gender controversy In a statement lastThursday, the IOC said Khelif and Lin had been ""victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA"". ""Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,"" the IOC said. ""According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA secretary general and CEO. The IBA board only ratified it afterwards and only subsequently requested that a procedure to follow in similar cases in the future be established and reflected in the IBA regulations. The minutes also say that the IBA should 'establish a clear procedure on gender testing'. ""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure - especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years. ""Such an approach is contrary to good governance."" The IBA insisted its decision was ""necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition"". It said in a statement last week: ""The athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential. This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors."" The IBA said Lin did not ultimately appeal against the IBA's decision to Cas, while Khelif withdrew an appeal, ""thus rendering the decisions legally binding"". In June 2023, 69 of 70 Olympic federations voted to strip the IBA of its status. Before the vote, IOC president Thomas Bach said: ""We do not have a problem with boxing. We do not have a problem with boxers. ""The boxers fully deserve to be governed by an international federation with integrity and transparency."" In response, the IBA accused the IOC of making a ""tremendous error"" and compared the move to Germany's actions in World War Two. An IBA statement read: ""We have successfully implemented all recommendations outlined by the IOC in its roadmap. ""Despite the challenges, the IBA remains committed to the development of boxing and the organisation of official tournaments and world boxing championships at the highest level. ""We cannot conceal the fact that today's decision is catastrophic for global boxing and blatantly contradicts the IOC's claims of acting in the best interests of boxing and athletes."" Cas rejected an appeal by the IBA against the decision. A new body, World Boxing, was set up in April 2023.  Among five pledges, the new organisation says it will ""keep boxing at the heart of the Olympic movement"" and ""ensure the interests of boxers are put first"". One of its key goals is maintaining boxing as an Olympic sport after it was provisionally dropped from the 2028 Games over the IBA issues. However, it remains in discussions with the IOC to get recognition as the worldwide governing body for the sport. It is backed by representatives from Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Sweden and the United States. The IBA has previously said it ""strongly condemns"" the establishment of a ""rogue"" organisation, adding it has ""initiated a series of actions to protect its autonomy as the official worldwide governing body"". Unlike previous Games, boxing at the Tokyo Olympics was organised by the IOC rather than the IBA. In 2019, the IOC delegated responsibility for the organisation and management of doping control at the Olympics to the International Testing Agency (ITA). The IOC said it took a ""zero-tolerance policy"" to anyone found using or providing doping products. Tests include, but are not excluded to, determining an athlete's levels of testosterone. In late 2021 the IOC issued new guidance on transgender athletes in womenâs sport. This placed the responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport. The framework came in the aftermath of Tokyo 2020 when weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympics in a different gender category to that in which they were born. While the IOC said there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female events, it issued a 10-point document that it expected every sport to apply before Paris 2024. Since then many sports have banned transgender women from taking part in women's sport, such as athletics, aquatics and both rugby codes. However, the rules have been applied differently so there are sports in which transgender women or athletes with differences of sex development (DSD) can compete. Boxing is one of those as the IOC, which has been overseeing Olympic boxing, has not updated the eligibility criteria rules since Tokyo 2020. In boxing the IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female. The IOC said it ""supports the participation of any athlete who has qualified and met the eligibility criteria to compete in the Olympic Games as established by their IF (international federation). The IOC will not discriminate against an athlete who has qualified through their IF, on the basis of their gender identity and/or sex characteristics"".  Both cases had been reported on last year around the World Championships, although not widely in Europe or the US given the boycotts of the event. The IOC included the details on the media information portal before Paris 2024, although that was later removed. Given heightened scrutiny around women's sport and transgender athletes or people with DSD, media picked up on the IOC saying athletes who had failed the tests were due to compete in the womenâs division. Since then the IOC has insisted the fighters were ""born women and raised women"", but the IBA has continued to insist its tests suggest their eligibility for womenâs boxing is in question. Khelif will fight for gold on Friday after victory in her semi-final on Tuesday, with Lin's final the following evening.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jqjwdyl1ko,"Kim Jong Un wants Trump back, elite defector tells BBC","The highest-ranking defector to escape North Korea in years, Ri Il Kyu has met Kim Jong Un seven times.",2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:51.761065,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump returning to the White House would be “a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity” for North Korea, according to a man in a unique position to know. Ri Il Kyu is the highest-ranking official known to have defected from North Korea since 2016 and has been face to face with Kim Jong Un on seven separate occasions. The former diplomat, who was working in Cuba when he fled with his family to South Korea last November, admits to ""shivering with nerves"" the first time he met Kim Jong Un. But during each meeting, he found the leader to be “smiling and in a good mood”. “He praised people often and laughed. He seems like an ordinary person,” Mr Ri tells the BBC. But he is in no doubt Mr Kim would do anything to guarantee his survival, even  if it meant killing all 25 million of his people: “He could have been a wonderful person and father, but turning him into a god has made him a monstrous being.” In his first interview with an international broadcaster, Mr Ri provides a rare understanding of what one of the world’s most secretive and repressive states is hoping to achieve. He says that North Korea still views Mr Trump as someone it can negotiate with over its nuclear weapons programme, despite talks between him and Kim Jong Un breaking down in 2019. Mr Trump has previously hailed the relationship with Kim as a key achievement of his presidency. He famously said the two “fell in love” exchanging letters. Just last month, he told a rally Mr Kim would like to see him back in office: “I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth.” North Korea is hoping it can use this close personal relationship to its advantage, says Mr Ri, contradicting an official statement from Pyongyang last month that it “did not care” who became president. The nuclear state will never get rid of its weapons, Mr Ri says, and would probably seek a deal to freeze its nuclear programme in return for the US lifting sanctions. But he says Pyongyang would not negotiate in good faith. Agreeing to freeze its nuclear programme “would be a ploy, 100% deception”, he says, adding that this was therefore a “dangerous approach” which would “only lead to the strengthening of North Korea”. Eight months after his defection, Ri Il Kyu is living with his family in South Korea. Accompanied by a police bodyguard and two intelligence agents, he explains his decision to abandon his government. After years of being ground down by the corruption, bribery and lack of freedom he faced, Mr Ri says he was finally tipped over the edge when his request to travel to Mexico to get an operation on a slipped disc in his neck was denied. “I lived the life of the top 1% in North Korea, but that is still worse than a middle-class family in the South."" As a diplomat in Cuba, Mr Ri made just $500 (£294) a month and so would sell Cuban cigars illegally in China to make enough to support his family. When he first told his wife about his desire to defect, she was so disturbed she ended up in hospital with heart problems. After that, he kept his plans secret, only sharing them with her and his child six hours before their plane was due to depart. He describes it as a “life-or-death gamble”. Regular North Koreans who are caught defecting would typically be tortured for a few months, then released, he says. “But for elites like us, there are only two outcomes - life in a political prison camp or being executed by a firing squad."" “The fear and terror were overwhelming. I could accept my own death, but I could not bear the thought of my family being dragged to a gulag,” he says. Although Mr Ri had never believed in God, as he waited nervously at the airport gate in the middle of the night, he began to pray. Turning to North Korea’s recent closer ties with Russia, Mr Ri says the Ukraine war had been a stroke of luck for Pyongyang. The US and South Korea estimate the North has sold Moscow millions of rounds of ammunition to support its invasion, in return for food, fuel and possibly even military technology. Mr Ri says the main benefit of this deal for Pyongyang was the ability to continue developing its nuclear weapons.  With the deal, Russia created a ""loophole"" in the stringent international sanctions on North Korea, he says, which has allowed it “to freely develop its nuclear weapons and missiles and strengthen its defence, while bypassing the need to appeal to the US for sanctions relief”. But Mr Ri says Kim Jong Un understands this relationship is temporary and that after the war, Russia is likely to sever relations. For this reason, Mr Kim has not given up on the US, Mr Ri says.  “North Korea understands that the only path to its survival, the only way to eliminate the threat of invasion and develop its economy, is to normalise relations with the United States."" While Russia might have given North Korea a temporary respite from its economic pain, Mr Ri says the complete closure of North Korea’s borders during the pandemic “severely devastated the country’s economy and people’s lives”. When the borders reopened in 2023 and diplomats were preparing to return, Mr Ri says families back home had asked them to “bring anything and everything you have, even your used toothbrushes, because there is nothing left in North Korea”. The North Korean leader demands total loyalty from his citizens and the mere whiff of dissent can result in imprisonment. But Mr Ri says years of hardship had eroded people’s loyalty, as no-one now expected to receive anything from their “Supreme Leader” Kim Jong Un.  “There is no genuine loyalty to the regime or to Kim Jong Un anymore, it is a forced loyalty, where one must be loyal or face death,” he says. Recent change has largely been driven by an influx of South Korean films, dramas and music, which have been smuggled into the North and are illegal to watch and listen to.  “People don’t watch South Korean content because they have capitalist beliefs, they are simply trying to pass the time in their monotonous and bleak lives,” Mr Ri says, but then they begin to ask, “Why do those in the South live the life of a first-world country while we are impoverished?"" But Mr Ri says that although South Korean content was changing North Korea, it would not bring about its collapse, because of the systems of control in place. “Kim Jong Un is very aware that loyalty is waning, that people are evolving, and that’s why he is intensifying his reign of terror,” he says. The government has introduced laws to harshly punish those who consume and distribute South Korean content. The BBC spoke to one defector last year who said he had witnessed someone be executed after sharing South Korean music and TV shows. North Korea’s decision, at the end of last year, to abandon a decades-old policy of eventually reunifying with the South, was a further attempt to isolate people from the South, Mr Ri says. He describes this as Kim Jong Un’s “most evil act”, because all North Koreans dream of reunification. He says that while North Korea’s past leaders had “stolen people’s freedom, money and human rights, Kim Jong Un has robbed what was left of them: hope”. Outside North Korea, much attention is paid to Kim Jong Un’s health, with some believing that his premature death could trigger the collapse of the regime. Earlier this week, South Korea’s intelligence agency estimated that Mr Kim weighed 140kg, putting him at risk of cardiovascular disease. But Mr Ri believes the system of surveillance and control is now too well established for Kim’s death to threaten the dictatorship. “Another evil leader will merely take his place,” he says. It has been widely speculated that Mr Kim is grooming his young daughter, thought to be called Ju Ae, to be his successor, but Mr Ri dismisses the notion.  Ju Ae, he says, lacks the legitimacy and popularity to become the leader of North Korea, especially as the sacred Paektu bloodline, which the Kims use to justify their rule, is believed to run only through the men of the family. At first, people were fascinated by Ju Ae, Mr Ri says, but not any more. They question why she was attending missile tests rather than going to school, and wearing luxury, designer clothes instead of her school uniform, like other children. Rather than waiting for Mr Kim to become ill or die, Mr Ri says the international community has to come together, including North Korea’s allies China and Russia, to “persistently persuade it to change”.  “This is the only thing that will bring about the end of the North Korean dictatorship,"" he adds.  Mr Ri is hoping that his defection inspires his peers, not to defect themselves, but to push for small changes from the inside. He does not have lofty ambitions, that North Koreans will be able to vote or travel, merely that they can choose what jobs to work, have enough food to eat and be able to share their opinions freely among friends. For now, though, his priority is helping his family settle into their new life in South Korea and for his child to assimilate into society. At the end of our interview, he poses a scenario. “Imagine I offer you a venture and tell you, if we succeed we win big, but if we fail it means death.  “You wouldn’t agree, would you? Well that is the choice I forced upon my family, and they silently agreed and followed me,” he says. “This is now a debt I must repay for the rest of my life.” Additional reporting by Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2p4e43lro,"Two years, secret talks, high stakes: How prisoner swap deal was struck","The deal between Russia and the West followed a tumultuous, dramatic path until its completion on Thursday.",2 Aug 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:58.511144,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When a notorious Russian assassin and an American newspaper correspondent boarded separate planes in Turkey on Thursday, it marked the culmination of a secretive, dramatic prisoner swap deal between Russia and the West that was years in the making. The origins of this deal, which involved two dozen prisoners, can be traced back to 2022. But behind-the-scenes negotiations between Russia, the US and four European countries ramped up earlier this year before intensifying in recent weeks as a final agreement came into view for all sides. Those negotiations were at times feverish and testing. They also came as US-Russia tensions soared over the Ukraine war. ""It was the culmination of many rounds of complex, painstaking negotiations over many, many months,"" Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser who played a critical role in the deal, said shortly after the exchange. Senior White House officials provided a detailed timeline of events in a call with reporters, including from the BBC's US partner CBS, on Thursday. They said the first hint that Moscow may have been open to a deal came in the autumn of 2022. The US and Russia had been negotiating the release of Brittney Griner, the American basketball star who was arrested for possessing cannabis oil and sent to a Russian penal colony. Griner was eventually released later that year in a high-profile swap for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. But during those conversations, the White House officials said, Russia made clear it also wanted to secure the release of the hitman Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for shooting dead a man in a busy Berlin park on the direct orders of the Kremlin. Mr Sullivan told his German counterpart that Russia was angling for Krasikov's release, and asked whether Berlin would consider freeing him in exchange for Alexei Navalny, the vocal anti-Putin campaigner and opposition leader who was being held in Russia. Germany, however, was reluctant to release a hitman who had committed such a brazen murder on its own soil. While Mr Sullivan did not get a definitive answer from Berlin, the initial conversations in 2022, both between the US and Russia and the US and Germany, helped pave the way for the larger, more complex agreement struck in recent weeks that was completed on the sweltering runway of a Turkish airport. That's because both sides signalled, at least to some extent, what they wanted.  Russia made clear it wanted Krasikov. And Washington did not just want Navalny, it also wanted Paul Whelan, an ex-Marine who was jailed on espionage charges in Russia in 2018. The early elements of a potential swap deal then began to take shape - but there was still a long, long way to go. In late March 2023, a 31-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter from New Jersey was arrested by Russian intelligence agents while on a reporting trip. His detention raised a chorus of condemnation from the US and its allies. A day later, President Biden instructed Mr Sullivan to pull together a deal that would bring him, and Mr Whelan, home. The US directly contacted Russia. Communication then began in earnest, White House officials said, and their respective foreign ministers spoke on the phone. But the conversations soon moved from these top diplomats to the secretive intelligence services, which the US was hesitant to do as Mr Gershkovich was accused of spying and Washington feared involving the CIA would only fuel those claims. As the wheels of these tense negotiations were turning in late 2023, the US came to understand that the release of the hitman Krasikov was key to any successful deal, according to senior White House officials. Offers were made to Russia that did not include the 58-year-old assassin. They were always rebuffed. Given Krasikov was in jail in Germany and not the US, Washington did not have the power to free him unilaterally. Mr Sullivan spoke to his German counterpart almost weekly in late 2023 and early January 2024 in an effort to convince him to exchange Krasikov and meet Russia’s key demand for this deal. Any potential agreement, according to the White House officials, absolutely hinged on Germany releasing Krasikov. Moscow’s position, they said, was ultimately that its jailed spies should be returned in exchange for the Americans it accused of spying. With this in mind, the US worked to find more Russian spies held by its allies who could form part of a major deal. US officials, diplomats and CIA staff travelled the world looking for friendly governments willing to release prisoners fitting that description, according to the Wall Street Journal. A sign of their success came on Thursday, when Russians were released from prisons in Poland, Slovenia and Norway. In February of this year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met President Biden at the White House. And according to the account provided by the White House officials on Thursday, they discussed options for a swap that included all the key people - Krasikov, Navalny, Whelan, Gershkovich. There were positive signals from Russia, too. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in early February, Vladimir Putin spoke about Mr Gershkovich. ""I do not rule out that Mr Gershkovich may return to his homeland,"" he said. As the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg writes, it was a very public and unsubtle hint: Moscow was open to doing a deal. But on 16 February 2024, just days after that interview and the White House meeting between Chancellor Scholz and President Biden, and before any offer could put to the Russians, the potential deal collapsed in tragic circumstances. Arguably the most high-profile prisoner who could have been included in the exchange, Alexei Navalny, died in his Siberian prison cell aged 47. Supporters and relatives, as well as many foreign leaders, blamed Mr Putin for his death. Russian authorities said he died of natural causes. While almost nothing was known about the negotiations at the time of his death, Mr Navalny's colleague Maria Pevchikh said publicly that he had been close to being freed in exchange for Krasikov. BBC News was unable to independently verify her claims at the time. The Kremlin, meanwhile, publicly denied that a potential agreement had been close. But on Thursday, the White House confirmed it had been working to include Mr Navalny in the deal, which ultimately saw three people who had worked with the opposition figure freed from Russian custody.  ""The team felt like the wind had been taken out of our sails,” a visibly emotional Mr Sullivan said as he described the impact of Mr Navalny’s death. Mr Gershkovich's mother and father, in a dramatic coincidence, were meeting Mr Sullivan at the White House on the day Mr Navalny’s death was announced.  Recognising the significance of the news and the risk it posed to these negotiations, he told them it was ""going to be a little bit more of a rocky path"" going forward. The potential deal had to be restructured and the US and Germany regrouped. Vice-President Kamala Harris then held two important meetings to help keep a potential swap on track, a senior administration official told the BBC. She attended the Munich Security Conference in mid-February where she stressed the importance of releasing Krasikov to Chancellor Scholz.  She also met the prime minister of Slovenia, where two Russian prisoners identified by the US as being of a high priority to Moscow were being held. They were both released on Thursday. Then in the spring, the new deal which no longer included Mr Navalny took shape in the White House. And in June, Berlin agreed to exchange Krasikov. ""For you, I will do this,"" Mr Scholz told President Biden, according to Mr Sullivan. The deal was submitted to Russia. Moscow responded several weeks ago, in mid-July, accepting the terms of the agreement and the release of those on the list held in Russian jails.  But as the negotiations were reaching their final stages, domestic politics intruded, with Mr Biden coming under immense pressure from within his own Democratic Party to end his bid for re-election in November after a poor debate performance. According to Mr Sullivan, barely an hour before Mr Biden announced on 21July he would not seek re-election, he was on a call with his Slovenian counterpart finalising the prisoner swap. As with any high-stakes prisoner swap, the deal was not guaranteed even as the aircraft were lined up and the prisoners' routes home finalised.  ""We held our breath and crossed our fingers until just a couple of hours ago,"" Mr Sullivan said on Thursday afternoon. President Biden later posted a picture of the released Americans together on a plane headed for US soil, along with a short caption. ""[They] are safe, free, and have begun their journeys back into the arms of their families."""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5xvl1111yo,Mali army admits 'significant' losses in Wagner battle,It is a rare admission and comes after Russian mercenaries said one of their commanders was killed.,30 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:58.704390,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Mali's army has admitted it suffered “significant” losses during two days of fighting involving Tuareg separatist rebels and al-Qaeda-linked militants. It is rare for the military to own up to battlefield disasters and comes a day after its ally, the Russian mercenary Wagner group, said one of its commanders had died in the fighting that took place during a sandstorm. Neither Mali’s military nor Wagner have given figures, but the estimated death toll for Wagner fighters ranges from between 20 and 80. The clashes took place in the desert near Tinzaouaten, a north-eastern town on the border with Algeria.  According to Wagner, its fighters and a detachment from the Malian military were retreating from Tinzaouaten after clashes with separatist forces from the Tuareg ethnic group. Whilst waiting for reinforcements, their convoy was ambushed in attacks by the separatists and militants from an al-Qaeda affiliate, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). This account is backed up by the Malian army, which said one of its units ""was encircled by the coalition of terrorist forces"" and ""fierce fighting began before the arrival of reinforcements"", the AFP news agency quotes its statement read out on national TV as saying. ""The exemplary bravery and determination of our soldiers could not avoid a large number of losses in human lives and equipment,"" it added. Wagner estimated the Tuareg and Islamist fighters had combined manpower of more than 1,000 - and that one of two Russian helicopters that went to the aid of the mercenaries and Malian soldiers was downed. JNIM said 50 Russians and 10 Malian soldiers had been killed, although these numbers have not been verified. The extent of the co-ordination between the separatists and Islamists is also unclear. Such groups were allied in 2012 when Islamist militant groups who took over northern Mali amidst a Tuareg uprising. This prompted former colonial power France and then the UN to intervene to stop them advancing south to the capital, Bamako. The Tuareg groups went on to sign a peace agreement with the government, but the jihadists persisted with attacks from their desert bases. Their continuing insurgency was the main reason Mali's military seized power in 2020, accusing the civilian government of failing to provide security. It pledged to end the militant attacks asking France and the UN to withdraw their forces, and bringing in Wagner fighters. But this resulted in some Tuaregs taking up arms again, as they were angered by the departure of  UN peacekeepers amongst other issues. Tuareg and Arab groups in the north feel ignored by the more prosperous south. Northern Mali is a vast, arid, under-developed and sparsely populated area, which the separatists call Azawad. The security situation in the whole country remains precarious - and these recent losses for the Russian-backed junta are humiliating. Russia's defence ministry has been approached for more help by Wagner, but it is unclear whether that will be forthcoming given the war in Ukraine. A spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence has been quoted as saying that Ukraine played a role in the recent ambush against Wagner fighters in Mali. He added that “the rebels received necessary information, and not just information, which enabled a successful military operation"" against Wagner fighters. A photo published by the Kyiv Post on Monday claimed to show Malian rebels holding a Ukrainian flag after the battle. BBC Verify has established this image dates back to a video posted on X in June, in which no Ukrainian flag can be seen, only the Azawad flag.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4y8rx04jpo,"Secrecy over China meeting 'absurd', say campaigners","The Executive Office argues publishing notes of the meeting could harm ""international relations"".",30 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:58.804684,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The office of Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers has been criticised by human rights campaigners for refusing to release records of a meeting with a senior Chinese diplomat. Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly welcomed the UK's Chinese ambassador Zheng Zeguang to Stormont Castle in Belfast in May. But their office has declined to publish any notes of the meeting, arguing it could harm ""international relations"". Exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Simon Cheng described the Executive Office's response as ""deeply troubling"".  The former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate has previously told how he was tortured in China and accused of inciting political unrest. ""For the people of Northern Ireland who cherish freedom and democracy, this lack of transparency is unacceptable,"" he said. ""They deserve to know the nature of the discussions held with a representative of a regime known for its human rights abuses,"" he added. The Chinese Embassy released its own report of the meeting, saying they discussed ""friendship and cooperation"" between China and Northern Ireland. A fortnight after the meeting, the Chinese ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office following allegations of ""foreign interference in the UK"" including cyber attacks. Patrick Corrigan of Amnesty International said TEO's approach was ""somewhat absurd"" and showed an ""unacceptable pattern of secrecy"". He had submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking minutes of the meeting and asking whether human rights issues were discussed. In its response TEO said the information ""cannot be disclosed at this time"", citing an exemption under the FOI Act on ""international relations"". The department said it needed more time to consider ""where the balance of the public interest lies"". Mr Corrigan contrasted the approach to the UK government which ""regularly publishes reports of its meetings with overseas governments"" and highlights ""when ministers raise human rights concerns"". ""People have a right to know what is being said on our behalf, particularly to a government responsible for atrocious human rights abuses,"" he added. Hundreds of people in Hong Kong have been arrested since China introduced a controversial national security law in 2020 in response to pro-democracy protests. China has also been accused of the detention of an estimated 1,000,000 people from the minority Uyghur population in so-called ""re-education"" camps in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing and Hong Kong authorities argue the security law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened autonomy. China has also denied allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Mr Corrigan added: ""This latest refusal to disclose what was discussed is part of an unacceptable pattern of secrecy from the Executive Office about such meetings with the Chinese government going back years."" For years Stormont has worked to develop links with China, with the executive setting up a trade bureau in Beijing in 2014. In 2022, TEO was found by the Information Commissioner's Office to have breached FOI legislation in refusing to release records of a meeting with Belfast's Chinese consul general. TEO was approached for further comment on declining to release notes of the meeting with the Chinese ambassador, but it did not respond. Many Northern Ireland politicians pride themselves on speaking up for human rights on the global stage. Their focus of concern in recent times has tended to be on Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza war. But when it comes to China's record on human rights, the corridors of power at Stormont seem more muted. There is seldom mention of China's detention of minorities in ""re-education camps"", nor its controversial Hong Kong security law which has clamped down on pro-democracy protests. For campaigners, the refusal to publish records of meetings with Chinese diplomats raises fears that no concerns are being raised in private, never mind in public. The Northern Ireland Executive has, for years, courted China for educational links and investment, setting up a trade bureau in Beijing in 2014. In warning that releasing minutes of meetings could damage ""international relations"", it is clear Stormont wants these connections to continue. But when it comes to public transparency - particularly on human rights - campaigners say there should be no compromise."

The fleet, which also included a red London bus, left the Ukrainian Embassy in the capital on Thursday. It is expected to take four days to reach Kharkiv in Ukraine's war-torn east. The convoy has been loaded with supplies from aid groups based in Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. The Ulez scrappage scheme enables  Londoners to claim up to £2,000 for scrapping non-compliant cars. A partnership between Transport for London (TfL) and the British-Ukrainian Aid charity saw some of the scrapped vehicles donated to the humanitarian cause. A London bus also joined the convoy, used to transport aid including food, clothing and stretchers. Once in Kharkiv, the vehicles will all be distributed to local charities. The red bus will be donated to charity Peaceful Heaven of Kharkiv and used to evacuate civilians from hot spots in and around the city. Steph Wilson from the Help Ukraine Group Support (HUGS), based in Hungerford, Berkshire, said this meant the fleet would be a ""double gift"" to the Ukrainian city. ""The benefit is the vehicles actually stay out there. It's the gift of the vehicle plus all the humanitarian aid with which they're filled,"" she said. HUGS, along with a group based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire and the Swindon Humanitarian Aid Partnership (SHAP), has donated some of the supplies being taken to the front line. Mike Bowden, chair and founder of SHAP, said: ""Our laser focus is to maximise the number of vehicles for humanitarian use in Ukraine. ""Whether evacuating the injured, the elderly or children or delivering food or medical aid, each vehicle will make a real difference to the lives of ordinary Ukrainians and save lives,” he added.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5r2mk18k1o,'Not every Norwegian feels guilty but many do',"Norway's oil wealth has made it one of the world's richest countries, but some feel bad about it.",29 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:59.107594,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Many Norwegians are feeling guilty, according to Elisabeth Oxfeldt. The professor of Scandinavian literature at Oslo University says wealthy Norwegians are increasingly contrasting their comfortable lives with those of people who are struggling, particularly overseas. “We’ve seen the emergence of a narrative of guilt about people’s privileged lives in a world where others are suffering,” she says. Thanks to its significant oil reserves, the largest in Europe after Russia’s, Norway is one of the world’s richest countries. The strength of its economy, as measured per member of its population, is almost twice that of the UK, and bigger even than that of the US. Norway even runs a budget surplus – its national income exceeds its expenditure. This is in marked contrast to most other nations, including the UK, which have to borrow money to cover their budget deficits. Prof Oxfeldt is an expert on how Scandinavian books, films and TV series reflect the wider culture of their time. She says she increasingly sees these mediums explore Norway’s wealth guilt. “By looking at contemporary literature, films and TV series, I found that the contrast between the happy, fortunate or privileged self and the suffering ‘other’ brought about feelings of guilt, unease, discomfort or shame. “Not everyone feels guilty, but many do,” adds Prof Oxfeldt, who has coined the phrase “Scan guilt”. Plots featured in recent Norwegian dramas include members of the “leisure class” who rely on services provided by migrant workers who reside in bedsits in their basements. Or women who realise that they have achieved gender equality in the workplace by relying on low-paid au pairs from poor countries to care for their children, says Prof Oxfeldt. Life has a habit of imitating art. In March, the Norwegian government said it put a stop to granting work permits for au pairs from the developing world. Tabloid newspaper VG had dubbed the practice “west end slavery”. The Norwegian people’s guilt trips have also been egged on by a variety of people and organisations eager to question whether Norway’s wealth is based on ethical practices. In January this year, The Financial Times published a special report that uncovered how fish oil made from ground whole fish caught off the coast of Mauritania in Africa was used as feed by Norway’s extensive salmon farms. The farmed Norwegian fish, which is sold by major retailers in Europe, “is harming food security in western Africa”, the paper said. Environmental pressure group Feedback Global insisted that “the Norwegian salmon industry’s voracious appetite for wild fish is driving loss of livelihoods and malnutrition in West Africa, creating a new type of food colonialism”.  The Norwegian government responded that it wanted “to ensure sustainable feed”, and was working towards “increased use of local and more sustainable raw materials”. Indeed, Norway says it is eager to drive a transition to a green economy, so ensuring aquaculture is sustainable will be essential as the petroleum sector is scaled back to make way for a so-called “green shift”. This should free up finance, technology and labour for perhaps more future-proof maritime sectors, such as offshore solar and wind power, and algae production for food and medicine. But, for now at least, this will not be enough to silence vocal critics of Norway’s lucrative petroleum industry. Climate campaigners object to continued drilling for oil and gas. Other critics say that Norway is far too reliant upon its oil earnings. On the one hand, thanks to the oil and gas-based wealth, Norway’s working hours tend to be shorter than most comparable economies, its worker rights stronger, and its welfare system more generous. Unsurprisingly, Norway has long been one of the happiest in the world, according to the World Happiness Report. It is currently in seventh place. But on the other hand, reasons Børre Tosterud, an investor and retired hotelier, Norway’s “utter reliance on oil earnings” has resulted in an excessively large government budget, an inflated public sector, and a shortage of labour that holds back the private sector. “It’s not sustainable,” he insists. Norway has always looked to the oceans for buoyancy. The seas have been a source of food and energy, a place of work and a generator of wealth for centuries. Yet it was only in the late 1960s when discoveries of oil and gas helped turn around the fortunes of this previously relatively underdeveloped nation. Since then, most of Norway’s vast oil earnings have been invested internationally by Norges Bank Investment Management, which is part of Norway’s central bank. Its main investment fund, Government Pension Fund Global, otherwise known as ""the oil fund”, has assets worth about 19tn kroner ($1.7tn, £1.3tn). Norway’s oil export earnings surged following Russia’s 2022 invasion. Critics claimed the country was profiteering from the war, or at least failing to share enough of its sudden windfall with the victims of the aggression that had caused it. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre dismissed accusations of war profiteering, countering that Norway was able supply to much needed energy to Europe during a time of crisis. He also points out that Norway has been one of Ukraine’s biggest financial supporters, and as such is arguably punching above its weight, given that Norway’s population is only 5.5 million. Jan Ludvig Andreassen, chief economist at Eika Group, an alliance of independent Norwegian banks, says that Norwegians have “become much richer than we had expected”. Yet at the same time, he says that after a period of high interest rates and painful inflation, partly caused by a historically weak krone, which makes imported goods and services expensive, ordinary Norwegians don’t feel rich. Norway is also a world-leading donor of overseas humanitarian aid.  “I think Norwegians are generous contributors to good causes,” observes Prof Oxfeldt. However, pointing to Norway’s additional oil exports that have come about as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, Mr Andreassen says that Norway’s charitable donations “are small fry relative to the extra earnings arising from war and suffering”.  This is a view echoed by Mr Tosterud. But do they agree with Prof Oxfeldt  that many Norwegians feel guilty? “Not really, except perhaps in some circles such as the environmental movement,” says Mr Andreassen. Mr Tosterud agrees. “I don’t have any sense of guilt, and neither do I think it is widespread in Norway.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5rjjvvzlzo,Meloni meets Xi as Italy vows to 'relaunch' ties with China,Ms Meloni last year removed Italy from President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative.,29 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:59.202962,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said China is an ""important interlocutor"" in managing global tensions, as she met President Xi Jinping in Beijing. President Xi in turn hailed the ""long-established friendly"" ties, as well as ""tolerance, mutual trust and mutual respect"" between Beijing and Rome. During her first trip to China since taking office, Ms Meloni and Chinese Premier Li Qiang met on Sunday and signed a three-year plan to strengthen economic co-operation. The five-day visit comes after Ms Meloni last year removed her country from President Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the time, Rome said the massive Chinese investment scheme aimed at promoting bilateral trade had gained less than expected. Ms Meloni said her visit to China was an effort to ""relaunch"" the relationship. After talks with President Xi at Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Ms Meloni said: ""There is growing insecurity at an international level and I think that China is inevitably a very important interlocutor to address all these dynamics"".  She said the two nations must ""think together"" to remain stable and guarantee peace.  In a statement, Italy's prime minister's office said the two leaders' discussions included the war in Ukraine, the risks of a further escalation of the situation in the Middle East and the growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific. It added that Prime Minister Meloni and President Xi addressed some of the most important global governance issues, ""from artificial intelligence to the fight against climate change and the UN Security Council reform"". Mr Xi urged Rome and Beijing to ""uphold the spirit of the Silk Road"", so that East-West relations could ""rebound into a new era"".  ""Both sides face important opportunities for mutual development"", he said, adding, ""Beijing welcomes Italian companies that invest in China and is willing to import more high-quality Italian products"". Italy was the only major Western nation to sign up to the BRI, one of China's most ambitious trade and infrastructure projects, sometimes referred to as the ""New Silk Road"". The move was heavily criticised at the time by the US and some other major Western countries. Since coming to power in 2022, Ms Meloni has sought to lead a more pro-Western and pro-Nato foreign policy than her predecessors. Before withdrawing from the BRI, Ms Meloni had described the former government's decision to join it as ""a serious mistake"". ""Every country which is a [BRI] member knows that China is first and they are second and I don't think Italy as a G7 member wanted to be grouped together with  Russia, Pakistan or Sri Lanka,"" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. ""Without BRI [membership] Meloni is coming to China at a different level of engagement - less as a vassal and more as a partner,"" she added. Under Ms Meloni, Italy has moved to block a Chinese state-owned company from taking control of tyre making giant Pirelli. Rome has also supported a recent move by the European Commission to impose tariffs of as much as 37.6% on electric vehicles imported from China. Two-way trade between two countries reached 66.8 billion euros (£56.3bn) last year, making China Italy's largest non-EU trading partner after the US."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kr240gd18o,Ukraine's hopes and challenges after long wait for F-16s,Russia intends to destroy dozens of US-built warplanes as soon as they arrive in Ukraine.,26 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:30:59.298960,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The first F-16 fighter jets are set to arrive in Ukraine from Nato member states, after many months of preparation and pilot training. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said they are essential to help Ukrainians push back against Russia's aerial dominance and “unblock the skies”. Russian forces have been preparing for the Ukrainian F-16s too. They have targeted a number of Ukrainian military airfields and there are growing concerns that these long-awaited jets will be attacked and destroyed soon after they arrive. In July alone, at least three airfields have come under attack: Myrhorod and Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine and one in southern Odesa region. Moscow claims it has destroyed five Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jets and one MiG-29, along with a radar and valuable Patriot air defence launchers. Kyiv authorities are keeping mostly silent and the air force has refused a BBC request for comment, claiming on social media that the destroyed jets and air defence system were in reality decoys that had cost Russia several expensive Iskander missiles. Decoys or not, Ukraine’s allies, and many Ukrainians themselves, fear there may be insufficient protection for the US-built F-16s. Until now the Ukrainian air force has largely relied on “dispersed operations” to ensure its warplanes are not hit on the ground, according to Prof Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for air power and technology at Royal United Service Institute. Planes and equipment are regularly moved around within or between bases, he explains, so “if Russia does launch an airstrike, they’ll probably just hit an empty tarmac or grass”. But that may have to change if Ukraine is to protect its valuable fleet of Western aircraft from Russian missiles. F-16s require perfectly smooth runways swept clear of stones and other small items of debris, if they are not to run the risk of engine failure. Any attempt to improve the infrastructure on existing bases will become visible to “Russian observation whether orbital or human intelligence sources,” Prof Bronk believes. Until recently, Russia would have relied on surveillance or satellite imagery to spy on Ukraine’s air bases, so it never knew for sure if its missiles had struck their targets. Now it has spy drones such as Zala, Supercam and Orlans that can send real-time images from deep inside Ukrainian territory, avoiding Ukraine’s electronic detection and jamming systems. Drone unit commander Oleksandr Karpyuk says the drones can now be pre-programmed to fly long distance in radio silence. Russian defence ministry video showing the attack on Myrhorod airbase earlier this month appears to show the moment Iskander ballistic missiles hit the area where several jets were parked. There is no indication that the F-16s have yet arrived in Ukraine, although Kyiv-based aviation expert Anatoliy Khrapchynsky suggests Russian forces are “probing” Ukrainian airfields because they believe they might be. Only this month US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the transfer of F-16s was already under way from Denmark and the Netherlands. Some 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries. When in theatre they will roughly double the number of fighter jets currently at Ukraine’s disposal, which are all Soviet-era MiG-29s and Su-27s. For Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky they cannot come a moment too soon, after an 18-month wait. He had originally opened for twice as many as the 65 he has been promised, such is the need for fighter aircraft to carry out key types of mission: These defensive missions are for the moment perhaps the most important. This year Ukraine has been under huge threat from Russian glide bombs, which are basically dumb bombs fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States. Russia is churning out these add-on kits and these souped-up bombs have been wreaking havoc on the front lines. Around 3,000 were dropped in March alone, mostly from Su-34 fighter-bombers. If Ukraine can protect its F-16s on the ground, the hope is that they could play an important part in pushing back the Russian aircraft to a point where the glide bombs can no longer target Ukrainian ground forces. The F-16s would work alongside the limited number of Western-supplied surface to air missile systems such as Patriot and NASAMS which are already on the ground. The warplanes will be armed with AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, which can turn “autonomous” and self-guide to target after a certain distance from launch. Currently Ukraine’s Soviet-era aircraft use missiles that require a constant “lock” on a Russian plane throughout the targeting and launching phase. That places the Ukrainian jets under greater threat because they cannot fire a missile and then turn away, which the F-16s can do. Not everyone believes the F-16s will be able to protect Ukraine’s frontline towns. If the jets fly high, they will be vulnerable to Russia’s air defence systems, warns Prof Bronk. If they fly low, they will have to fly deeper into Russian territory to give their missiles sufficient range. And that carries even greater risks. Rather than seeing the F16s as potential targets, Anatoliy Khrapchynsky argues they will only enhance Ukraine’s air defences, because of their ability to intercept cruise missiles while Patriot batteries shoot down ballistic missiles. Each airbase will have crews on shift that will take off in case of an aerial threat. But the problem is that Ukraine is facing a big shortage of Patriots and missiles for them. President Zelensky says Ukraine needs at least 25 Patriot defence systems to protect its skies and it has only a handful. The F-16s won’t necessarily turn the tide of the war, but they will have a significant impact in attacks on the ground and in the air. The question is whether there will be enough of them, and whether they can be protected on the ground."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9x22k5qv2o,China and Russia stage first joint bomber patrol near Alaska,The patrol comes amid US warnings of deepening ties between China and Russia.,25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:07.973526,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russia and China have staged a joint patrol over the north Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea near the coast of Alaska. The two countries have carried out several joint patrols in the past, and Russia regularly flies its bombers over the Bering Sea. But Wednesday’s joint patrol was the first that brought together bombers from both countries in the north Pacific area. Moscow and Beijing said it was ""not aimed at any third party"", while the US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said the bombers, which it intercepted, stayed in international airspace and were “not seen as a threat”. But Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski described the event as an “unprecedented provocation by our adversaries”, adding that it was “the first time they have been intercepted operating together.” China has said the patrol has “nothing to do with the current international and regional situation"". Russian TU-95MS strategic missile carriers and the Chinese air force's Xian H-6 strategic bombers were deployed, according to Russia. China and Russia have developed closer ties since Moscow was placed under sanctions by the West following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Any display of deepening cooperation is watched with apprehension by the US and European countries. Earlier this month, Moscow and Beijing wrapped up their fourth joint naval patrol in the northern and western Pacific Ocean. Nato countries issued a joint statement at the end of a recent summit in Washington accusing China of being a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine and urging it to “cease all material and political support"" to the country's war effort. In a report on Arctic security published on Monday, the US Department of Defence expressed concern over the two countries' “growing alignment”, and predicted that their military cooperation would continue to increase. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected this, saying Russian-Chinese cooperation in the Arctic could only contribute to an atmosphere of “stability and predictability” in the area."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl7yk2l925xo,Tricked into conversion therapy in Russia for being trans,Trans people from Russia say years of pressure coupled with new laws are making them leave the country.,28 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.071415,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"On a remote farm in Siberia, a man handed Ada a knife. In front of them was a pig.  “Cut it off,” he said. “If you want to go ahead with the operation, you need to understand what castration means.” Ada was 23 and transgender - she had been tricked into going to a conversion therapy centre after coming out to her family. She says that earlier in the summer of 2021, a relative asked her to accompany her to Novosibirsk, where she was due to undergo major heart surgery. Ada says a man met them at the airport and after a long drive, the car suddenly stopped, Ada’s relative jumped out, the driver turned to Ada, demanded she hand over her smartwatch and phone, and told her bluntly: “Now we’re going to cure you of your perversion.” “It was only when a parcel of warm clothes arrived two weeks later that I realised that I wasn't just there for a fortnight or a month,” she adds, saying she was forced to take testosterone, pray and do manual labour, such as chopping wood. Confronted with the pig, she had a panic attack and didn’t do what she had been told.  Nine months later, she managed to escape. Someone had left a phone lying around which she used to call the police.  They sent officers to the centre, who said Ada had to be allowed to leave as she was being held against her will. The BBC contacted the centre but the person we spoke to denied all knowledge of conversion therapy programmes. We also contacted Ada’s relative but have not had a response. Ada’s time there was the lowest point in a battle she says she has been fighting all her life - first with her family, then with wider society, and now with Russia’s increasingly draconian LGBT laws. Transgender people in Russia have had their human rights systematically eroded by the government’s broader political strategy of attacking vulnerable minorities, according to UN independent expert, Graeme Reid.  One year after Russia passed a law banning gender reassignment surgery, he says that transgender Russians had been deprived of their “most basic rights to a legal identity and access to healthcare”. The new legislation also stopped people from changing their personal details on documents - Ada was one of the last people to get her name officially changed before the law came into effect in July 2023. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has lashed out at the West and LGBT rights, saying he is fighting for traditional Russian values. At a cultural forum in St Petersburg last year, he dismissed transgender people as “transformers or trans-something”. And at the end of 2023, Russia’s justice ministry announced another new ruling, declaring the “international LGBT movement” an extremist organisation. It didn’t matter that no such organisation existed. Anyone guilty of supporting what is now deemed “extremist activity” faces up to 12 years in jail. Even displaying a rainbow flag risks a fine, and a possible four-year prison sentence for repeat offences. In one of the first prosecutions under the new law, two tearful and terrified-looking young people appeared in court in the city of Orenburg in March. Their crime was to run a bar frequented by the LBGT community. Their case is still ongoing. After she escaped from the centre in Siberia, Ada moved into a small flat in Moscow where she offered other transgender people a safe place to stay. But the new laws were the final straw for her.  “I couldn’t stay any more… I had to leave Russia,” she says, talking from her new home in Europe. For Francis, who left Russia in 2018, the new laws mean he will probably never go home. Even before they were introduced, the authorities in his hometown of Yekaterinburg had taken action against him. “For as long as I can remember, I have known that I wasn’t a girl,” he says. But by 2017, he was married to Jack, had given birth to three children, and adopted two more. “I said to my husband, ‘Maybe I’m mistaken but I think I might be transgender.’” They agreed that Francis would consult a doctor. “They said, ‘You are transgender, 100%.’ I felt so much better. Everything slotted into place... I understood - this is who I am.” He began the process of transitioning, but before long the local authorities intervened. Their two adopted children were taken into care, and Francis was told their biological children would be next. The family left Russia and has been living in Spain ever since. Ally, who is non-binary and uses the pronoun “they”, left Russia in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It was a political decision, not connected to the pressures on the LGBT community, but those pressures have nonetheless taken their toll. When Ally was 14, someone asked: “Are you a girl or a boy?” “It gave me such a feeling of joy - I was so happy that she couldn’t tell from my outward appearance.” Years later they told a friend: “'I don’t think I’m a girl, but I don’t think I’m a boy either.' “She looked at me and said: ‘Oh, OK. Checks out.’ And then we carried on eating soup. It was one of the happiest moments of my life.” Ally now lives in Georgia and last year decided to have a mastectomy. Close family members still don’t know. “If I had just come to my parents and said, ‘Mum, Dad, I’m a lesbian,’ it would have been easier than me saying, ‘Mum, Dad, I’ve cut off my breasts and I want you to call me they.’” Although Ally had a medical diagnosis prior to the new Russian law banning gender reassignment, and had chosen a new gender-neutral name, it’s no longer possible to get passports and other key documents changed. Francis has the same problem. His documents all include his former name, which causes confusion when he is asked for ID or has to fill in forms. But he says life in Spain is good. He’s found work in a textile factory which he loves. Like Ally, Francis acknowledges that the climate of intolerance fostered by the new anti-LGBT laws has made relationships with family harder. “My mother doesn’t speak to me any more,” he says. “She thinks I have disgraced our family, and she’s embarrassed to look the neighbours in the eye. It’s as if I was some freak, or a thief, or had murdered someone.” And living abroad as a Russian while the war in Ukraine continues can add another layer of complexity, says Ally: “In Russia the authorities and the conservative parts of society don’t like us because we’re transgender. Abroad people don’t like us because we’re Russians.” All the trans community really wants, says Ada, is for “people to be able to dress how they want and not be afraid of being beaten up… I just want people to stop having to think about how to survive”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c28eym731zjo,Questions surround German man sentenced to death in Belarus,"A heavily choreographed video shows Rico Krieger apparently confessing to planting explosives, but there is no direct evidence shown.",27 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.264294,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A German man who has been sentenced to death in Belarus for terrorism has been shown in a heavily choreographed interview on state-controlled television, apparently confessing to planting explosives near a railway line. There is no direct evidence of that in the 16-minute video for which Rico Krieger was filmed, handcuffed, through the metal bars of an oddly pristine and empty cell. He says he was acting on instruction from Ukraine, though no proof is given. Krieger is then shown in tears appealing to the German government for help ""before it’s too late"". He is believed to be the first Western citizen ever given the death penalty in Belarus. The emotional and crudely produced video on state TV appears to be part of a campaign of increasing pressure in talks with the German authorities, which some believe may focus on a possible prisoner exchange. State media say Rico Krieger has not appealed against the verdict, which is extremely rare for someone sentenced to death. “I’m very surprised,” said Andrei Paluda, a Belarusian campaigner against the death penalty. “I don’t know the circumstances, I can only surmise. But maybe he’s been promised that consultations are ongoing and there might be some kind of swap.” The unprecedented nature of the case has prompted speculation about links to efforts by Russia, a close ally of Belarus, to free an FSB hitman imprisoned in Germany for the 2019 murder in Berlin of a Chechen-Georgian who fought against Russia. The deputy spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry declined to comment on such rumours. She also pointed to a history in Belarus of filming staged interviews with prisoners, including opposition activists forced to make confessions to secure their release. The ministry told the BBC that it was working ""intensively"" with the Belarusian authorities on behalf of ""the person concerned"" in this case, but gave no more details citing privacy reasons. It condemned the death penalty as a ""cruel and inhumane form of punishment"". Last week in Minsk, a foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that a German citizen had been convicted of ""terrorism"" and ""mercenary activity"". Anatoly Glaz said ""a number of options"" had been proposed to Berlin, adding that ""consultations"" were under way. A profile for Rico Krieger on the LinkedIn platform includes an application for a job in the USA posted last year. There, he described himself as a 29-year-old Red Cross paramedic from Berlin who had previously worked in security for the US embassy. He mentioned plans to emigrate to the US and said he had applied for a passport. A US State Department spokesperson has confirmed to the BBC that Krieger worked for Pond Security, a firm offering security services to US facilities in Germany, between 2015 and 2016. The company itself declined to comment, citing ""diplomatic efforts"" and privacy. The German Red Cross also confirmed that Rico Krieger had worked ""in the past"" for ""a district association"" of the organisation. A spokesman mentioned his ""great concern"", but added that the Red Cross had been told not to comment. In this story, there are precious few incontrovertible facts. Officials in Belarus either don’t reply, or reply that they will say nothing –  not even to confirm the precise charges. That may be at least partly due to the political sensitivities. It’s also standard practice in cases involving the death penalty, highly secretive in this authoritarian state. “I will give you no information,” Vladimir Gorbach, the lawyer who represented Krieger in court, told me by phone. Then he added: “Watch Belarusian official TV. It’s all written there."" Rico Krieger’s trial appears to have concluded in June. But state-controlled media were silent about this case for weeks. Independent journalists are mostly in exile now, or in prison. But now it seems information has been fed to faithful state reporters and the order to make a noise has been given. On Monday, Ludmilla Gladkaya wrote that Krieger had been found guilty on six counts, including an act of terrorism and intentional damage to communication lines. Citing court documents which the BBC has not been able to obtain, she claimed he had applied to join the Kalinovsky Regiment, founded by Belarusians to fight in Ukraine and designated a ""terrorist group"" in Belarus. The journalist claims Krieger was following instructions from the regiment - as well as from Ukraine’s SBU security service - as some kind of initiation process, including in planting the explosives. The SBU won’t comment, while the Kalinovsky regiment told me only: ""He is not our fighter."" When Belarusian state TV presented its own case – labelling its film the ""confession"" of a ""German terrorist"" – it didn’t prove any link to the regiment either. It showed no communication with the Kalinovsky Regiment. Instead it displayed screenshots from encrypted email messages which it said were Krieger seeking to sign up with other foreign units in Ukraine. One is supposedly to the II International Legion but a spokesperson there tells me the address is false. ""Perhaps it was created specially for fishing [sic] or something,"" they wrote, calling it an act of ""fraudulence"". There are multiple other oddities about this case. We’ve never heard of foreign volunteers in Ukraine being required to perform ""tests"" as part of their recruitment, let alone something so risky as set a bomb in Belarus. There are precious few Western tourists in the country these days. Rico Krieger was never going to blend into the background. In the propaganda film, he claims he was motivated by the high pay offered to fight in Ukraine. But he then says the monthly salary is around €2,000 (£1,680), less than he was being paid in Germany. Whilst Krieger writes in good English on LinkedIn, messages attributed to him in the film are barely literate. One reads: ""I can’t find the adress that me Was given"". And at one point, the film displays a photo of Krieger from his LinkedIn account. But it’s been doctored, with a Ukrainian flag added to the background for extra impact. Ludmilla Gladkaya’s article tallies with Krieger’s ""confession"" for the state TV cameras: that he photographed military sites and railway lines for a handler in Ukraine and was then directed to a rucksack hidden in long grass. He was told to take it to a railway station in Azyaryshcha, east of Minsk, and leave it by the rails. Later that night there was an explosion – but no casualties. The following day Krieger was arrested. The journalist quotes his statements on arrest, refers to data from his phone and witnesses including a taxi driver. But no independent information has emerged about any evidence. There are certainly CCTV images of Krieger arriving at Minsk airport last October. They show the German smiling at passport control, apparently relaxed. He’s travelling alone and only has hand luggage. But no surveillance footage of him planting explosives, or acting suspiciously, has been released. There are just shots of Krieger entering Minsk's main railway station, and then standing on the platform of an unidentified regional train station, in broad daylight. The timing of this case seems significant. The ""noise"" erupted just after the US journalist Evan Gershkovich was found guilty of espionage in Russia, a charge his friends and employers denounce emphatically as false. He’s been sentenced to 16 years. Vladimir Putin has hinted in the past that he would consider exchanging Gershkovich - and possibly others – for Vadim Krasikov, the FSB assassin imprisoned in Germany. But months on, no deal has yet been done. So could Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko be riding to his rescue – with a German bargaining chip? The propaganda film is definitely heavy on threat. It has a doom-laden voiceover and grim scenes acted out by men in balaclavas and with truncheons. At the centre of it all is a man begging for his life. In tears, Rico Krieger says he has made the ""worst mistake"" ever and now feels ""absolutely abandoned"" by his government. His words seem scripted, though the emotion is raw. “His only chance now is to ask for a pardon - and for the president to change the death penalty to life in prison,"" activist Andrei Paluda said.  ""We know of cases when political mechanisms, not legal ones, have come into play. Perhaps that can work here, too.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4vl9gy2wo,Ukraine thrown into war's bleak future as drones open new battlefront,"On the front line, drones are killing hundreds every day - showing the world a new kind of high-tech war.",25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.347408,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The black box sits on the army truck dashboard like a talisman, its tiny screen lighting up with warnings when Russian drones are above us. We are driving fast along a country road in the darkness near the front lines outside Kharkiv. Like many in this war, the soldiers inside have come to revere the little cube they call ""sugar""; it warns of the unseen dangers above. On the vehicle’s roof are three mushroom-shaped antennas that make up separate drone-jamming equipment. The car emits an invisible aura of protection that will thwart some, but not all, of the Russian attack drones patrolling the skies above this battlefield. ""It has detected the Zala Lancet Russian drones,"" says Senior Lt Yevhenii, 53, from the front passenger seat, describing one of the most powerful long-range Russian drones and its targeting drone. ""Is that why we’re driving so fast?"" I ask, aware that the drone-jamming antenna is useless against a Lancet. ""We’re not a priority for them, but it’s still better not to slow down because it’s very dangerous,"" says Yevhenii, from the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard. The jamming equipment blocks roughly 75% of frequencies that drones use to communicate with their operators, but some like the Lancet are difficult to block because they are entirely autonomous once their target has been marked. Because of the Lancet’s power, it tends to be used on larger targets, such as armoured vehicles or infantry positions, the Ukrainians say. Almost none of this technology was here in Ukraine a year ago; now it is commonplace. Drones, which were once peripheral to the war, are a central component for both sides, alongside infantry and artillery as Ukraine struggles to hold back Russian advances. Ukraine has been thrown into the bleak future of war, where within minutes individual soldiers, fast-moving vehicles and trench positions can be precisely targeted. Drones have civilians in their sights too: about 25 from Russia attacked Kharkiv on Tuesday night, although most were intercepted. Ukraine's army is fighting back with its own drones, and there are dozens across this stretch of front line. One Ukrainian soldier tells me every day they kill 100 Russians. The last images from drone cameras are usually of men panicking, their arms flailing, weapons firing before they are killed. The brigade’s 37-year-old drone commander, who goes by the call sign Aeneas, says that without shelter in a building there is little chance of survival - for Russians, and his men too. ""It's the new way or a new path in modern war. In 2022 it was only infantry war and today one half is only a war of drone, a battle between Russian drones and ours,"" he says. The move to drone warfare is a combination of necessity and innovation. Drones are in plentiful supply, even though when armed they lack the explosive fire power of artillery.  Ukraine has consistently run short of artillery shells, and its allies have been slow to produce and supply them. But a Drone Coalition of Ukrainian allies has pledged to supply the country with a million drones this year. Russia has made its own innovations on the battlefield too, using an older technology, and the village of Lyptsi, just six miles (10km) from the Russian border, has paid the price. It was devastated by glide bombs - Soviet-era ""dumb bombs"" fitted with fins and a satellite guidance system. Some are as large as 3,000kg (6,600lbs) and, when launched from aircraft, glide onto Ukrainian infantry positions and towns to highly destructive effect. One woman named Svitlana, who was driven out of Lyptsi by these attacks, told us: ""Everything was exploding all around. Everything was burning. It was scary there. It was impossible to even get out of the cellar."" Aeneas takes us on a tour of his drone teams, embedded along the front line in Lyptsi. Every vehicle we encountered near there was fitted with drone-jamming equipment; but the jammer’s protection ends when you exit the vehicle. It’s dangerous to be caught out in the open, so we follow Aeneas running across the rubble for cover. Out of breath, we make it to the drone unit’s underground base beneath a ruined building, where we are introduced to two operators, Yakut and Petro. There are drones on every surface, next to a frying pan with their evening meal.  They get through many hundreds of drones in a month, as most are single-use and detonate on their target. Their weapon of choice is the First Person View (FPV) drone, which carries a payload of between 1kg (2.2lbs) and 2kg of explosive, packed with shrapnel. The drones are modified off-the-shelf models which have cameras to send video back to their remote operators. ""We call them celebration drones in Ukraine. They were used to film weddings and parties before the war,"" Aeneas says. I watch on a screen in real time beside Yakut who is fixed in concentration flying a drone manually to a target, across open fields and woodland. ""He knows every puddle, every tree in the area,"" Petro says. The FPV drone approaches a building where a Russian soldier is believed to be hiding. It flies through an open window and detonates, the operator's screen turning to static as the signal is lost. At the same time, another drone team is targeting a Russian Tigr light-armoured vehicle and scores a direct hit, captured by a second surveillance drone that’s watching from above. The men stay on these positions, flying missions day and night, for up to five days at a stretch and spend as little time outside as possible. Their biggest fear is glide bombs: one landed nearby earlier that week, and the whole building shook. What happens if there’s a direct hit? I ask Petro. ""We die,"" he replies. Aeneas shows me a recording from earlier in the week: a Russian soldier is caught in the open and the unit’s drone has him in its sights. The soldier notices it and runs for cover, hiding in a drainage culvert by the roadside. Slowly the drone lowers to its level, checking one side of the drainage pipe, then going around the other side, where the soldier is hiding. It detonates and the man is blown out, dying by the roadside. ""He was divided into two parts,"" explains Aeneas. The operators are cool and dispassionate, almost clinical in their targeting and killing. They are as far as three miles (5km) away from their targets, one step removed from the immediate blood and guts of the battlefield. But encountering these weapons on the frontline is nerve-wracking. A few days later, after dark, at an infantry trench close to Russian positions, a unit commander tells me he believes the Ukrainians have the upper hand in drone warfare, the Russians the advantage with glide bombs.  Russia also has the advantage in drone numbers: six for every Ukrainian one, although the drone teams I was with say they have the technological edge and are quicker at finding ways to counter-attack and jam Russian drones. The trench is in a wooded copse, surrounded by fields, a thick canopy of trees provides cover. But as we are speaking a Russian FPV drone is detected and begins to move closer to the position. The few dim lights, mostly phone screens, are turned off in the trench, and the men sit silently as the drone’s approach gets louder. We hold our breath as it hovers overhead. For what seems like an age, no one dares move. But then the drone moves on, in search of another target. The largest drone in the brigade’s arsenal is the Vampire, which with its six rotors is the size of a coffee table. Again we join Aeneas on another mission in Lyptsi after dark, under the sound of constant artillery fire, where we meet the heavy bomber team. They work to attach the bomb to the drone.  ""[Weighing] 10kg (22lb), the Russians call this drone the Bogeyman,"" says Aeneas. Its payload is powerful enough to take out their intended target, a Russian command post, they say. As the men work, a Russian drone makes a number of passes overhead: each time it does, the soldiers retreat into the basement, wait for the all-clear, then resume the assembly. As the drone takes off into the night in a cloud of dust, they watch its progress again from a second surveillance drone. Just then, with barely any warning, we see on the drone’s thermal camera three Russian glide bombs detonating over the Ukrainian position, over a kilometre away. The shock waves are visible: seconds later they reach our location and the house around us shudders violently. Ukraine’s allies know that by supporting the drone effort, they are helping the country’s cause, but it isn’t simply an act of charity. The head of the British military, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, has said that the UK’s armed forces can learn from Ukraine how to fight future wars. He said in a speech on Tuesday that he wants the Army to have ""battalions of one-way attack drones"". Aeneas and his men know this. As we leave their position, a Russian drone returns and we drive off at speed into the darkness. In the truck he tells me: ""No one is fighting war this way - they are learning from us. This will be the future war."" Follow Quentin on X"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07p5zrexvo,Teenager held over murder of Ukraine nationalist ex-MP,An 18-year-old man is held over the fatal shooting of Iryna Farion last week.,25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.433724,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"An 18-year-old man has been arrested in south-east Ukraine on suspicion of shooting dead Iryna Farion, a controversial former MP and linguistics professor. The teenager was tracked down in Dnipro, more than 900km (550 miles) from the  western city of Lviv where the attack took place, after a murder hunt involving a large team of investigators. Farion, 60, was well known in Ukraine for prompting an outcry last year when she said that true Ukrainian patriots should not speak Russian in any setting because it was the language of the ""aggressor country"". She was dismissed from her university after being accused of inciting hatred, before being reinstated by a court in Lviv this year. Her murder was treated as premeditated and although CCTV cameras failed to film the shooting outside her home, they reportedly did capture an image of the suspect, described as a skinny young man. Farion's funeral attracted a big crowd on Monday in Lviv. She was an MP for two years until 2014, regularly appeared on TV and her YouTube blog had attracted more than 300,000 subscribers. The motive for the attack was unclear and President Volodymyr Zelensky said detectives were considering all potential lines of inquiry, including a potential Russian role in the murder. One report suggested a neo-Nazi group linked to Russia may have been involved and a member of the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party claimed that whoever fired the shot had taken orders from Russia. There was no indication of Russian involvement, although pro-Kremlin propagandist Margarita Simonyan pointed out on social media that Farion had sought the ""complete elimination"" of Ukraine's Russian-speaking population and had herself been eliminated. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Thursday that the teenaged suspect had been detained at his home in Dnipro, adding that he had rented at least three apartments in Lviv ahead of the shooting. One local website identified the suspect as a young footballer who had taken part in a tournament last month. The interior minister paid tribute to the ""139 hours of continuous work"" by investigators and crime specialists who had painstakingly checked the shooter's escape route as well as 100 hectares of forest. In a statement on the messaging service Telegram, Mr Klymenko said the investigation ""was inclined to believe that the shooter is only a perpetrator"", indicating that it may have been co-ordinated by others. The suspect's father told Radio Liberty that he was on the front line and had not seen his son for some time.  However, he said the teenager had no anti-Ukrainian views and was a patriot who had completed courses in preparation for joining the army."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cervpedjejwo,PM agrees with Army chief's warning of 'volatile' world,Gen Sir Roland Walker says the country must be ready to fight a war in three years.,24 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.519582,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Sir Keir Starmer ""completely agrees"" with the thrust of a warning from the new head of the Army that Britain must be prepared for an ""increasingly volatile"" world, Downing Street has said.  In his first speech in the role on Tuesday, Gen Sir Roland Walker said the country must be ready to fight a war in three years. The prime minister's official spokesman said Sir Keir himself had talked about ""a new and dangerous era"", with threats from countries like Russia, North Korea and Iran.  It comes as the UK has signed a new defence agreement with Germany. Asked whether Sir Keir agreed with Gen Walker's comments, the PM's spokesman said he had spoken about the new era being ""defined by volatility and insecurity"".  ""That is exactly why the government's first and foremost committed to national security,"" he added.  The government has launched a review of the current state of the UK armed forces, the threats the country faces and the capabilities needed to address them.  Asked whether, if the country needed to be ready for war in three years, it was right to spend time on a review, the PM's spokesman said: ""The prime minister completely agrees with the thrust of the head of the Army.  ""He has talked previously about the new and dangerous era we live in and that is why we have launched the strategic defence review to assess those dangers, to assess those challenges, and ensure that we have got the capabilities we need to respond to those challenges as and when they arise."" In his speech at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference, Gen Walker, who took over as chief of the general staff last month, said war was not inevitable and the Army had ""just enough time"" to prepare itself to avoid conflict.  He said he aimed to double the Army's fighting power in three years and triple it by the end of the decade.  He vowed to increase the ""lethality"" of his force through modernisation and new technology, without the need for greater troop numbers.  The size of the UK's regular Army, excluding volunteers, has been falling in recent years.  Labour has said it is committed to increasing spending on defence to 2.5% of national income when economic conditions allow, with the defence review setting out a ""roadmap"" for doing this.  However, the Conservatives have criticised the government for not matching its election pledge to reach 2.5% by 2030.  It comes as Defence Secretary John Healey makes his first visit to Germany to sign a new defence declaration with the country.  He is also visiting France, Poland and Estonia this week, in what the government has described as a ""reset of relationships"" with the UK's European neighbours.  In the agreement, the UK and Germany have pledged to work more closely together to strengthen their defence industries, reinforce European security and support Ukraine.  Germany is the second biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, with the UK the third biggest donor. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng8e3j72yo,What one Moscow square says about Russia's worsening relations with West,Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has signed an order renaming Europe Square Eurasia Square.,24 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.603020,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Moscow's Europe Square is no more. The city’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, has signed an order renaming this place Eurasia Square.  It's a little change that says a lot about the direction in which Russia is moving: away from the West. It’s not the prettiest square in the Russian capital. It's certainly no match for Red Square, with the breathtaking onion domes of St Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin. Eurasia Square is built beside the bustling ""Kyiv Railway Station"" and a hotel, where the BBC’s Moscow Office was once located. There’s a fountain and an unusual composition created by a Belgian sculptor entitled The Abduction of Europa. I remember when this square was constructed just over 20 years ago. It was built as a symbol of unity on the continent of Europe. There were once dozens of flags of different European countries flying here. They were removed last year, and now the name’s gone too. Goodbye Europe; hello Eurasia. But what exactly is Eurasia? Different countries have different concepts of Eurasia. President Vladimir Putin officially terms Russia a Eurasian power. He uses the word to mean Russia is geographically in Europe and Asia but civilisationally distinct from both. Europe Square's commemorative plaque still stands. It reads: “As a token of stronger friendship and unity between the European countries, the government of Moscow has decided to create the ensemble of the Square of Europe in the Russian capital.” The reality is that Russia’s war in Ukraine and Western sanctions have put enormous strain on relations between Moscow and Europe. The Russian authorities talk constantly now of the need to tilt east and look towards China, North Korea, Asia as a whole. Europe isn’t just out of fashion - it is portrayed by the Russian authorities as the enemy. It’s not the first time that the Moscow authorities have played politics with street names after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022 the street where the US embassy is located was renamed “Donetsk People’s Republic Square,” a reference to the self-proclaimed breakaway region of Ukraine, which Russia later claimed to have annexed. In similar fashion, the following month the area around the British embassy became “Luhansk People’s Republic Square"". Back on (former) Europe Square, what do passers-by make of the change to Eurasia? “It’s the right decision,” Olga tells me. “We’re not friends with Europe right now. I don’t want to be in Europe.” “Eurasia is good,” says Anna. “Russia borders Europe and Asia. I was born in Kazakhstan, so this is fine with me.” “Europe has different standards now,” Pasha tells me. “They think in a different way. We’re gradually splitting away.” But Yevgeniya is disappointed. She sees the name change as ""a sign of conflict between different countries."" ""It’s so sad,"" she adds. But at the end of the day, does a name really matter? Following the 1917 Russian Revolution so many streets and squares in Russia were renamed to feature the word ""communism"". Did it help the Soviet Union build communism? Not in the slightest. The decision to ditch the word Europe from a square doesn’t mean that Russia won’t one day, once again, look West."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c03l9eky1p9o,Europe must brace for decade of Ukraine war - Nato chief,"The ""paradox"" is the longer Nato commits to Ukraine the faster a resolution will come, Jens Stoltenberg says.",18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:08.690646,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Europe must be prepared for a decade of Ukranian war, the outgoing secretary general of Nato has warned. Speaking to the BBC, Jens Stoltenberg said the ""paradox"" of the war in Ukraine is the longer the western military alliance commits to fighting the war, the faster a resolution will be reached.  Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Stoltenberg, who ends his 10-year tenure as secretary general in October, urged European Nato members to boost their commitments amid fears that US funds could be slashed or even stopped if Donald Trump wins a second term as US president in November's election.  Asked if Nato allies had to be prepared for the conflict in Ukraine going on for more than 10 years, Mr Stoltenberg said: ""Yes."" He added: ""But the main message is that the stronger the support for Ukraine and the longer we are willing to commit, the sooner this war can end.  ""The paradox is that now President Putin believes that he can wait us out. So therefore, the war continues. ""When we communicate very clearly that we are here for long haul, that we have strong enduring support for Ukraine, then we have the conditions for a solution where Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent state."" It comes as Nato announced a command unit to coordinate support for Ukraine will be operational in Germany from September.  ""This will provide more predictability and accountability and support and it will also demonstrate our enduring commitment to support Ukraine,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""The time to stand up for freedom and democracy is now and the place is Ukraine."" Mr Stoltenberg's comments come as Germany announced it was planning to nearly halve military aid for Ukraine next year - from around £6.7bn (€8bn; $8.7bn) to around £3.4bn. Finance Minister Christian Lindner said Ukraine's financing was ""secure for the foreseeable future"" due to a G7 group of rich nations scheme to raise $50bn from interest on frozen Russian assets. The planned aid cut comes amid fears in Ukraine and among its European allies that US funding could dry up during a potential second Trump White House. This week former US President Trump chose JD Vance, one of the most isolationist members of the Republican Party, as his running mate. The Ohio senator has previously said: ""I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another."" A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, he told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia. Mr Stoltenberg said he was confident that the US would remain in the alliance because ""it's in the US security interest to have a strong Nato"". There is also a ""strong bipartisan support for Nato in United States, both in the Congress, but also in the opinion polls"", he argued. Asked whether a second Trump term could mean less funding for Nato, Mr Stoltenberg said: ""The right thing to do regardless of what you think about the US commitment to Nato is to invest more in our defence. ""First of all, it increases the likelihood that the US will stay a strong ally. ""Second, if something really bad does happen then it is good we have stronger European and Canadian defence capabilities."" Mr Stoltenberg said the ex-US president made ""absolutely right and valid criticisms"" of European allies for not spending enough on defence and relying too much on the US. But ""this has now changed"", he added.  Nato members of the military alliance pledged to spend at least 2% of the value of their economies - measured by GDP - on defence per year by 2024. The UK is one of the 23 of Nato's 32 members to achieve the target this year - spending  2.3% of GDP on defence.  Mr Stoltenberg said: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because, despite our differences, we have always been able to unite around our core values: to protect and defend each other. ""I expect that to be the case after the US elections."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg5lyd25jno,'Atomic bomb hell must never be repeated' say Japan's last survivors,Victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki believe their horrific past must act as a warning for the future.,27 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:18.134252,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"It was early in the day, but already hot. As she wiped sweat from her brow, Chieko Kiriake searched for some shade. As she did so, there was a blinding light - it was like nothing the 15-year-old had ever experienced. It was 08:15 on 6 August 1945. “It felt like the sun had fallen - and I grew dizzy,” she recalls. The United States had just dropped an atomic bomb on Chieko's home city of Hiroshima - the first time a nuclear weapon had ever been used in warfare. While Germany had surrendered in Europe, allied forces fighting in World War Two were still at war with Japan. Warning: This article contains graphic content that some readers may find upsetting Chieko was a student, but like many older pupils, had been sent out to work in the factories during the war. She staggered to her school, carrying an injured friend on her back. Many of the students had been badly burnt. She rubbed old oil, found in the home economics classroom, onto their wounds. “That was the only treatment we could give them. They died one after the next,” says Chieko. “Us older students who survived were instructed by our teachers to dig a hole in the playground and I cremated [my classmates] with my own hands. I felt so awful for them.” Chieko is now 94 years old. It is almost 80 years since the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and time is running out for the surviving victims - known as hibakusha in Japan - to tell their stories. Many have lived with health problems, lost loved ones and been discriminated against because of the atomic attack. Now, they are sharing their experiences for a BBC Two film, documenting the past so it can act as a warning for the future. After the sorrow, new life started to return to her city, says Chieko. “People said the grass wouldn’t grow for 75 years,” she says, “but by the spring of the next year, the sparrows returned.” In her lifetime, Chieko says she has been close to death many times but has come to believe she has been kept alive by the power of something great. The majority of hibakusha alive today were children at the time of the bombings. As the hibakusha - which translates literally as “bomb-affected-people” - have grown older, global conflicts have intensified. To them, the risk of a nuclear escalation feels more real than ever. “My body trembles and tears overflow,” says 86-year-old Michiko Kodama when she thinks about conflicts around the world today - such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza war. “We must not allow the hell of the atomic bombing to be recreated. I feel a sense of crisis.” Michiko is a vocal campaigner for nuclear disarmament and says she speaks out so the voices of those who have died can be heard - and the testimonies passed on to the next generations. “I think it is important to hear first-hand accounts of hibakusha who experienced the direct bombing,” she says. Michiko had been at school - aged seven - when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. “Through the windows of my classroom, there was an intense light speeding towards us. It was yellow, orange, silver.” She describes how the windows shattered and splintered across the classroom - the debris spraying everywhere “impaling the walls, desk, chairs”. “The ceiling came crashing down. So I hid my body under the desk.” After the blast, Michiko looked around the devastated room. In every direction she could see hands and legs trapped. “I crawled from the classroom to the corridor and my friends were saying, ‘Help me’.” When her father came to collect her, he carried her home on his back. Black rain, “like mud”, fell from the sky, says Michiko. It was a mixture of radioactive material and residue from the explosion. She has never been able to forget the journey home. “It was a scene from hell,” says Michiko. “The people who were escaping towards us, most of their clothes had completely burned away and their flesh was melting.” She recalls seeing one girl - all alone - about the same age as her. She was badly burnt. “But her eyes were wide open,” says Michiko. “That girl’s eyes, they pierce me still. I can’t forget her. Even though 78 years have passed, she is seared into my mind and soul.” Michiko wouldn’t be alive today if her family had remained in their old home. It was only 350m (0.21 miles) from the spot where the bomb exploded. About 20 days before, her family had moved house, just a few kilometres away - but that saved her life. Estimates put the number of lost lives in Hiroshima, by the end of 1945, at about 140,000. In Nagasaki, which was bombed by the US three days later, at least 74,000 were killed. Sueichi Kido lived just 2km (1.24 miles) from the epicentre of the Nagasaki blast. Aged five at the time, he suffered burns to part of his face. His mother, who received more serious injuries, had protected him from the full impact of the blast. “We hibakusha have never given up on our mission of preventing the creation of any more hibakusha,” says Sueichi, who is now 83 and recently travelled to New York to give a speech at the United Nations to warn of the dangers of nuclear weapons. When he woke up after fainting from the impact of the blast, the first thing he remembers seeing was a red oil can. For years he thought it was that oil can that had caused the explosion and surrounding devastation.  His parents didn’t correct him, choosing to shield him from the fact it had been a nuclear attack - but whenever he mentioned it, they would cry. Not all injuries were instantly visible. In the weeks and months after the blast, many people in both cities began to show symptoms of radiation poisoning - and there were increased levels of leukaemia and cancer. For years, survivors have faced discrimination in society, particularly when it came to finding a partner. “‘We do not want hibakusha blood to enter our family line,’ I was told,” says Michiko. But later, she did marry and had two children. She lost her mother, father and brothers to cancer. Her daughter died from the disease in 2011. “I feel lonely, angry and scared, and I wonder if it may be my turn next,” she says. Another bomb survivor, Kiyomi Iguro, was 19 when the bomb struck Nagasaki. She describes marrying into a distant relative’s family and having a miscarriage - which her mother-in-law attributed to the atomic bomb. “‘Your future is scary.’ That’s what she told me.” Kiyomi says she was instructed not to tell her neighbours that she had experienced the atomic bomb. Since being interviewed for the documentary, Kiyomi has sadly died.  But, until she was 98, she would visit the Peace Park in Nagasaki and ring the bell at 11:02 - the time the bomb hit the city - to wish for peace. Sueichi went on to teach Japanese history at university. Knowing he was a hibakusha cast a shadow on his identity, he says. But then he realised he was not a normal human being and felt a duty to speak out to save humankind. “A sense that I was a special person was born in me,” says Sueichi. It is something the hibakusha all feel that they share - an enduring determination to ensure the past never becomes the present. Atomic People will be broadcast on Wednesday 31 July on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.

Speaking to the BBC, Jens Stoltenberg said the ""paradox"" of the war in Ukraine is the longer the western military alliance commits to fighting the war, the faster a resolution will be reached.  Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Stoltenberg, who ends his 10-year tenure as secretary general in October, urged European Nato members to boost their commitments amid fears that US funds could be slashed or even stopped if Donald Trump wins a second term as US president in November's election.  Asked if Nato allies had to be prepared for the conflict in Ukraine going on for more than 10 years, Mr Stoltenberg said: ""Yes."" He added: ""But the main message is that the stronger the support for Ukraine and the longer we are willing to commit, the sooner this war can end.  ""The paradox is that now President Putin believes that he can wait us out. So therefore, the war continues. ""When we communicate very clearly that we are here for long haul, that we have strong enduring support for Ukraine, then we have the conditions for a solution where Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent state."" It comes as Nato announced a command unit to coordinate support for Ukraine will be operational in Germany from September.  ""This will provide more predictability and accountability and support and it will also demonstrate our enduring commitment to support Ukraine,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. ""The time to stand up for freedom and democracy is now and the place is Ukraine."" Mr Stoltenberg's comments come as Germany announced it was planning to nearly halve military aid for Ukraine next year - from around £6.7bn (€8bn; $8.7bn) to around £3.4bn. Finance Minister Christian Lindner said Ukraine's financing was ""secure for the foreseeable future"" due to a G7 group of rich nations scheme to raise $50bn from interest on frozen Russian assets. The planned aid cut comes amid fears in Ukraine and among its European allies that US funding could dry up during a potential second Trump White House. This week former US President Trump chose JD Vance, one of the most isolationist members of the Republican Party, as his running mate. The Ohio senator has previously said: ""I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another."" A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, he told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia. Mr Stoltenberg said he was confident that the US would remain in the alliance because ""it's in the US security interest to have a strong Nato"". There is also a ""strong bipartisan support for Nato in United States, both in the Congress, but also in the opinion polls"", he argued. Asked whether a second Trump term could mean less funding for Nato, Mr Stoltenberg said: ""The right thing to do regardless of what you think about the US commitment to Nato is to invest more in our defence. ""First of all, it increases the likelihood that the US will stay a strong ally. ""Second, if something really bad does happen then it is good we have stronger European and Canadian defence capabilities."" Mr Stoltenberg said the ex-US president made ""absolutely right and valid criticisms"" of European allies for not spending enough on defence and relying too much on the US. But ""this has now changed"", he added.  Nato members of the military alliance pledged to spend at least 2% of the value of their economies - measured by GDP - on defence per year by 2024. The UK is one of the 23 of Nato's 32 members to achieve the target this year - spending  2.3% of GDP on defence.  Mr Stoltenberg said: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because, despite our differences, we have always been able to unite around our core values: to protect and defend each other. ""I expect that to be the case after the US elections."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c035d05je2jo,"UK must be ready to fight war in three years, says Army head","General Walker used his first speech in his role to warn of threats posed by an ""axis of upheaval"".",23 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:18.485644,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Britain must be ready to fight a war in three years, the new head of the Army has said. Gen Sir Roland Walker has warned against a range of threats in what he called an ""increasingly volatile"" world.  But he said war was not inevitable and the Army had ""just enough time"" to prepare itself to avoid conflict.  Central to this was doubling the Army's fighting power by 2027 and tripling it by the end of the decade, he said. In his first speech in the role on Tuesday, Gen Walker said the UK faced danger from an ""axis of upheaval"".  Among the key threats facing the UK in the coming years, highlighted by the general in a briefing, is an angered Russia, which could seek retribution against the West for supporting Ukraine, regardless of who wins the war. He said: “It doesn’t matter how it ends. I think Russia will emerge from it probably weaker objectively – or absolutely – but still very, very dangerous and wanting some form of retribution for what we have done to help Ukraine."" He also warned that China was intent on retaking Taiwan, and Iran was likely to pursue nuclear weapons.  He said the threats they posed could become particularly acute within the next three years, and that since the war in Ukraine these countries had created a ""mutual transactional relationship"", sharing weapons and technology. But he said the path to war was not ""inexorable"" if the UK re-established credible land forces to support its strategy of deterrence to avoid war. He did not directly appeal for further funding or troops in his speech, describing his force of just over 70,000 regular troops as a ""medium-sized army"".  But he urged the British Army to modernise quickly - including focusing on technology like Artificial Intelligence and firepower, rather than numbers. Eventually, his ambition is for the Army to be able to destroy an enemy three times its own size.  This would mean firing faster and further, he said, helped by learning the lessons from the war in Ukraine.  The general's speech at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference comes one week after the government launched a ""root and branch"" defence review to ""take a fresh look"" at the challenges facing the armed forces. Launching the review, Defence Secretary John Healey described the current state of the armed forces as ""hollowed-out"" and said ""procurement waste and neglected morale cannot continue"". There are 75,325 members of the UK’s regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latest Ministry of Defence (MoD) figures from April 2024. That figure has been falling in recent years as recruitment has failed to match retention. The previous Conservative government reduced its target headcount from 82,000 to 72,500 by 2025. Members of the Nato military alliance have pledged to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence per year by 2024, though several nations are not likely to meet this target. The UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said the defence review would set out a “roadmap” to the goal of increasing this to 2.5%, but he is yet to put a timeline on this commitment."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr542l753po,Hungary stripped of EU meeting over Ukraine stance,"Hungarian PM Viktor Orban sparked anger last week by accusing the EU of pursuing a ""pro-war policy"".",23 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:18.576672,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borell, has stripped Hungary of the right to host the next meeting of foreign and defence ministers over its stance on the war in Ukraine. It comes weeks after Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, a role in which it would normally host the event, and amid anger over a meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier this month.   Mr Borrell said Hungary's actions should have consequences and that ""we have to send a signal, even if it is a symbolic signal"". Hungary described the move as ""completely childish"".  Every six months, under each new council presidency, the EU's foreign and defence ministers hold informal meetings to discuss the biggest global issues facing the bloc.  The next set of meetings will take place on 28-30 August and were to be held in Budapest, but on Monday Mr Borrell announced they would instead take place in Brussels.  Citing comments made after the meeting with Mr Putin in which Mr Orban accused the EU of having a ""pro-war policy"", Mr Borrell told reporters: ""If you want to talk about the war party, talk about Putin. ""I can say that all member states - with one single exception - are very much critical about this behaviour. ""I think it was... appropriate to show this feeling and to call for the next foreign and defence council meetings in Brussels."" Of the 26 other countries in the EU, only Slovakia has backed Hungary in the dispute.  However, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel, told reporters that he would go to Budapest because a boycott would be ""nonsense"". Mr Bettel felt that it was  better to tell the Hungarians the EU was unhappy with their actions as ""ignoring or not choosing dialogue would be a mistake"". Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski proposed that the August meeting should take place in western Ukraine, but that idea was blocked by Budapest. Responding to Mr Borrell's decision, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on Facebook: ""What a fantastic response they have come up with. ""I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it feels like being in a kindergarten."" Mr Orban's meeting with Mr Putin came as part of what he described as a ""peace mission"" - launched days after Hungary assumed the council presidency - that also saw him visiting the leaders of Ukraine and China, as well as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the US.  The trip sparked condemnation from leaders across the EU, with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen describing it as ""nothing but an appeasement mission"". Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said Mr Orban had ""no mandate to negotiate or discuss on behalf of the EU"", while Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the trip sent ""the wrong signal to the outside world and is an insult to the Ukrainian people’s fight for their freedom"". The episode is one of numerous occasions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on which Hungary has been at odds with most of the rest of the EU about the appropriate response.  After winning re-election in April 2022, just months after the invasion, Mr Orban told a crowd of supporters that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was among the people he would have to ""battle"" in his fourth term. Last year, he repeatedly used Hungary's veto to delay a €50bn (£42bn) package of non-military financial aid to Ukraine. "

Pompeyo González Pascual was detained in the northern town of Miranda de Ebro in January last year. Spain's top criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, found him guilty of sending devices to Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, the US and Ukrainian ambassadors, Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles, arms company Instalaza and the EU's satellite centre near Madrid. He was handed a 10-year term for terrorism and a further eight years for preparing and placing explosives for terrorist purposes. A Ukrainian embassy employee was lightly wounded by one of the devices, while the other five were dealt with by security services in November and December 2022. González denied the charges against him, but the judges said trial had been shown considerable evidence confirming his guilt. All the components for his letter bombs had been bought online, the court heard, and the devices were sent in wooden boxes with identical packaging and labels. Police had also observed him disposing of various metallic fragments and matches in the days before his arrest.  Some of the matches had the phosphorus scraped off and the chemical was used as part of the explosive for some of the devices, the court heard. DNA evidence from the stamps and envelopes was also found matching the profile of the accused. Analysis of his phone and computer indicated he had visited the prime minister's and defence minister's websites and had conducted internet searches on the risk of jail terms for the elderly as well as Russian entry requirements for foreigners. Two Russian state media apps were found on his mobile phone which were at the time difficult to access in Spain because of an EU ban on disinformation from the Russian state. Spain's Socialist prime minister has promised to provide Ukraine with support ""for as long as it takes"" including €1bn of military aid in 2024. Madrid has sent Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft missiles, although in real terms it lags behind other EU countries. The court said González had sought to ""cause a great commotion in Spanish society that would exert pressure so the governments of Spain and the US and other entities based on Spanish territory would stop supporting Ukraine"". The explosives used had been sufficient to cause injuries of varying severity both from the blast and the shrapnel that González had added to the letter bombs, the court heard."

Swapping a stadium for a waterway for the first time to open the ""greatest show on Earth"", the near four-hour spectacle culminated in French judo great Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-Jose Perec lighting a cauldron shaped like a hot air balloon that rose high into the Parisian sky. Blue, white and red fireworks had raised the Tricolore above Austerlitz Bridge before 6,800 athletes from 205 delegations travelled on 85 boats and barges past some of the French capital's most famous landmarks. There were surprise performances through the ceremony, including a cabaret number from US singer-songwriter Lady Gaga, as well as an emotional return of Canadian icon Celine Dion.  The day had started with major disruption when the French train network was hit by arson attacks and heavy rain in the evening put paid to the original plan by artistic director Thomas Jolly to use the Parisian sun to ""make the water sparkle"".  The lashing rain may have forced athletes to add rain ponchos and umbrellas to their planned outfits but it did not detract from the lively journey through French history, art and sport told by some 2,000 musicians, dancers and other artists. The last two boats to parade - first the US as the next hosts for Los Angeles 2028 and then France - had the largest numbers of athletes on board, while other barges carried several delegations together.  Rower Helen Glover and diver Tom Daley were Great Britain's flagbearers in Paris, which is hosting the summer Games for a third time and the first time in 100 years. In opening the 33rd summer Olympics, which are taking part against a difficult international and domestic political backdrop, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach told athletes they were now ""part of an event that unites the world in peace"". More than 10,500 athletes will compete across 32 sports at the Games, which will close on 11 August. The Olympic flame was a cauldron shaped like a hot air balloon that rose high into the Parisian sky Spectacular photos from the Paris 2024 opening ceremony Celine Dion makes stirring comeback at Olympics When organisers first revealed plans to hold the opening ceremony along the river in the heart of the city, rather than in a stadium as is usual, there were some raised eyebrows and questions over how they would manage such a huge security operation. The Seine itself had been under scrutiny for water cleanliness, while simply the logistics of transporting thousands of athletes along a six-kilometre stretch of river without a dress rehearsal seemed ambitious.    But on Friday evening, backed by a security operation involving tens of thousands of police, Paris pulled off its plan in dazzling fashion. At times it was bizarre - one moment Lady Gaga surrounded by pink and black feathers was singing in French, the next Bangladesh's athletes were being introduced on their boat.  A lot of the time it was brilliantly frenetic and occasionally emotional.  Given the miserable weather after what had been a sunny week in Paris until now, it seemed fitting that the storyline at the start of the ceremony was about the arrival of the Olympic flame in Paris not going according to plan. The torchbearer did not get the memo about it not being in the Stade de France, and then Zinedine Zidane's metro train broke down while he was transporting the torch. There followed ballet, cancan, opera, famous artwork coming to life and even Minions - and every so often a masked torchbearer was shown running across rooftops and even zip-lining, while the flotilla made its way from Austerlitz Bridge to Pont d'Iena. The boats with flag-waving athletes passed landmarks like the Louvre museum, Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and Arc de Triomphe and were treated to 12 artistic segments.  This video can not be played Lady Gaga's performance at the Paris 2024 opening ceremony One segment focused on rebuilding Notre Dame, which was damaged in a fire in 2019. A large troupe of dancers were accompanied by music composed using sounds captured from the iconic cathedral's reconstruction. Another explored French history, with costumed singers performing music from Les Miserables and a choir of headless Marie Antoinettes accompanying French heavy metal band Gojira. French-Malian R&B star Aya Nakamura - the world's most-streamed French-language artist - was among the musical acts.  The ceremony ended in the Trocadero, where the nearby Eiffel Tower lit up, with the flame - which had been on an elaborate journey with a masked torchbearer and a mechanical horse - being passed back to Zidane, who handed it to Rafael Nadal, Nadia Comaneci, Serena Williams and Carl Lewis. The quartet carried the flame on a boat towards the Louvre, where a series of French athletes and para-athletes past and present - including 100-year-old gold-medal cyclist Charles Coste - carried it and eventually handed it to Riner and Perec. And just when you thought the ceremony could not get any more beguiling, the pair lit the 30-metre high hot air balloon that now looks like it is floating above the city. But there was one more magical moment to come, with Dion thrilling the crowds at the Eiffel Tower with a powerful rendition of Edith Piafâs LâHymne a lâamour in her first performance since revealing a serious neurological condition in December 2022.  Celine Dion was singing at her second opening ceremony after Atlanta in 1996 Since the last Olympics - the Beijing 2022 Winter Games - wars have started in Ukraine and Gaza. In his speech, IOC president Bach told athletes that ""in a world torn apart by wars and conflicts, it is thanks to this solidarity that we can all come together tonight, uniting the athletes from the territories of all 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team"". Earlier in the ceremony Paris had been plunged into darkness as the first notes of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Imagine - sung by Juliette Armanet on a drifting raft - rang out.  The peace anthem, part of all Olympic opening ceremonies, is aligned with the message of unity and tolerance conveyed by the Games.  The impact of conflicts is being felt at these Olympics, with Russians and Belarusians banned following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just 15 Russian and 17 Belarusian athletes will be competing as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) in Paris and they were not part of the parade at the opening ceremony. Some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for the athletes of the Refugee Olympic Team and the Palestine Olympic Committee. More than 100 heads of state and government were in attendance, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Olympic organisers had to issue an apology after South Korea's athletes were mistakenly introduced as North Korea. Both French and English announcers introduced them as the ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" - the official name of North Korea. The two Koreas have been divided since the end of World War Two, with tensions between the states further escalating recently. And there was further embarrassment when the Olympic flag was raised upside down during part of the ceremony.  Images appeared to show the five coloured rings of the iconic emblem were in the wrong positions and had been hoisted incorrectly.

An editor for US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said the mother of two was arrested in Russia last October for failing to register as a foreign agent. She was sentenced on Friday, court officials said, the same day that fellow US journalist Evan Gershkovich was jailed for 16 years for espionage. Ms Kurmasheva denies any wrongdoing, and Stephen Capus, RFE/RL president and CEO, told the AP news agency that her conviction was ""a mockery of justice"". ""It’s beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,"" Mr Capus added. In a statement to the BBC, her husband Pavel Butorin said: ""The girls and I know Alsu has done nothing wrong. And the world knows it too. We need her home."" Speaking to journalists when her custody was extended in May, Ms Kurmasheva said she had not spoken to her two daughters since her arrest, adding that her health was deteriorating. Ms Kurmasheva, who holds both US and Russian citizenship, works for RFE/RL's Tatar-Bashkir service. The two languages are closely related and spoken by indigenous peoples in two central Russian regions.  Ms Kurmasheva's work frequently focused on issues facing the ethnic minorities of central Russia. According to RFE/RL, Ms Kurmasheva, who lives in the Czech Republic, travelled to Kazan in late May last year for a family emergency. She was detained while waiting for her return flight and her Russian and American passports were confiscated. In Russia it is illegal to fail to declare a US passport. She was fined, then arrested months later on the ""foreign agent"" charge. In December, while in custody, she was hit with the more serious charge of spreading false information. It is believed her conviction may be linked to a book she edited in 2022 entitled Saying No to War, containing interviews with and stories from Russians opposed to the invasion. Independent Russian media organisations and press freedom watchdogs say repressive laws are routinely used by Russian authorities to harass journalists and stifle independent reporting. The situation has worsened since the invasion of Ukraine, with the ""false information"" charge commonly used to stamp out criticism of the war. The charge was rushed through Russia's rubber-stamp parliament shortly after 24 February 2022 - the day Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time it was ""urgently needed because of the absolutely unprecedented information war waged against our country"". Russia has been accused of hoarding US citizens to use as bartering chips to secure the release of Kremlin allies imprisoned abroad.  Mr Gershkovich's sentencing on Friday raised speculation of a possible swap with Russian prisoners held in foreign jails. The speed of his conviction led some observers to believe that an exchange was imminent.  According to Russian judicial practice, an exchange generally requires a verdict to be in place already. But while a possible swap for Mr Gershkovich was mentioned by Russian President Vladimir Putin during an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson in February, Ms Kurmasheva's fate is less clear. "

Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev said the ferry had caught fire at Port Kavkaz but there was no risk of it spreading. The port lies a few kilometres from the Kerch bridge, which enables road and rail travel between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. ""Unfortunately there are injured and dead among the crew and port staff,"" Mr Kondratyev said. He added that emergency services were on the scene. Ukraine attacked the same area at the end of May, hitting an oil terminal near Port Kavkaz. The area around the Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait has been repeatedly attacked by Ukrainian forces since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Russian navy ships based in Crimea have been sunk or badly damaged. Earlier this month the head of Ukraine's navy said the Russian Black Sea Fleet had been forced to move almost all of its warships from occupied Crimea to other ports. In a separate development overnight, Ukraine's air defences downed seven Shahed-type attack drones and a cruise missile launched by Russia. Ukraine's energy ministry said one Russian attack drone struck a critical infrastructure facility in Sumy Region, cutting power to 50,000 consumers. The previous night, the head of Kharkiv's military administration in north-eastern Ukraine, Oleh Syniehubov, said an educational institute had been damaged in a Russian attack on the settlement of Derhachi to the north of Kharkiv city. Russia's defence ministry has now claimed that about 50 foreign ""instructors and mercenaries"" were killed in the strike, without offering any evidence other than a video of the purported attack. No mention was made of casualties on Monday. Meanwhile, Russian forces shot down 25 Ukrainian drones in the west of the country and over Crimea, the defence ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday.  The previous night, the ministry said it had downed over 85 Ukrainian drones."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3grzg9j3xgo,Seek shelter 'best option' in nuclear incident,The review considers worst-case scenarios but also says nuclear incident risks are extremely low.,24 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.030619,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Channel Island authorities will advise people to seek shelter in the unlikely event of a nuclear incident affecting the islands. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) looked at nuclear risks to the islands as part of ""routine risk and business continuity planning"". It said the risk of a nuclear incident occurring was extremely low and its review considered the worst-case scenarios. The UKHSA recommended shelter-in-place and stockpiling iodine be considered, but the pan-island Radiation Advisory Group decided shelter was the most appropriate choice for the islands. Nearby nuclear sites in France, radioactive waste dumped in the Hurd Deep trench off Alderney in the 1950s and 1960s and the transport of nuclear materials by ship in the seas around the Channel Islands were the risks considered. The sites in France looked at were the Orano La Hague nuclear fuel reprocessing site, the Flamanville nuclear power station and Cherbourg's naval dockyard, where nuclear submarines are dismantled. The UKHSA said if an incident happened at one of these sites wind direction and weather were important - wind could blow the radioactive material towards the islands and rain would cause more of it to land on the islands. Based on five years of weather data it said with the prevailing wind being from the west and south west it was unlikely a plume would be blown towards the islands. The UKSHA said if any material was due to arrive in the island the ""best option"" for people was to ""shelter-in-place"". This means going inside, closing doors and windows and turning off ventilation fans and air conditioning. However, in its modelling of a very large release of material at the Orano la Hague site, which it said was extremely unlikely due to the safety procedures in place,  sheltering was only needed in 5% of cases. The review's recommendations included: The Radiation Advisory Groups for both islands met to discuss the review's recommendations. The groups voted against stockpiling stable iodine in favour of focusing on sheltering in the unlikely scenario of a nuclear incident occurring. Prof Peter Bradley, Jersey’s director of Public Health, said: ""This review was part of our risk assessment cycle, and the findings are reassuring, indicating that the likelihood of such an incident is very low. ""The UKHSA considered worst case scenarios, which is important for context, and even in the highly unlikely event of such an incident, our typical weather patterns would likely minimise any risk to public health.""  Dr Nicola Brink, Guernsey's director of Public Health, said: ""The key public health advice would, should such an unlikely event occur, be for the community to seek shelter as a priority.  ""It was this, rather than stockpiling iodine, that the pan-island Radiation Advisory Group unanimously voted to be the most proportionate course of action when considering all relevant factors.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0dd7j0l93yo,How Russians will be at Olympics but not in medal table,Russia will have just 15 athletes at the Olympics competing as neutrals - BBC Sport looks at what they can expect at Paris 2024.,22 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.137558,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"There is a chance the medal table at Paris 2024 will not add up. That is because athletes from Russia and Belarus will be competing at the Olympics as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) and as well as not being allowed their national flags or anthems, they are also not going to be included in the official medal table. Russia and Belarus are banned from sending teams to the Games following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been supported by Belarus. But the countries are being invited to send individual athletes who meet strict criteria set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) relating to whether athletes support the war or have military links.   Russia has historically sent some of the largest contingents to the Olympics - even when competing at recent Games under sanctions imposed after a doping scandal - and is one of the medal-winning heavyweights.   But this time it will be very different. The IOC has invited just 36 Russian and 24 Belarusian athletes - of which only 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians have accepted the invitations. At Tokyo 2020, the Russian Olympic Committee sent 335 athletes and Belarus sent 101.  While Russia has said it was not planning to boycott the Games, its weightlifting federation has cited the ""unsportsmanlike selection principle"" in guiding its decision to turn down invitations for 10 athletes. Nine of those athletes initially accepted an invitation, according to the IOC. Its judo federation pointed to similar concerns, saying it would not accept the ""humiliating conditions"" and declined the invitation for its four athletes, one of whom the IOC listed as having initially accepted. So, how did we get to this point and what will the Olympics look like for the athletes who did accept? Athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports who have been eligible to compete as neutral athletes at Paris 2024 will participate as AINs (Individual Neutral Athlete or Athlete Individuel Neutre in French). It is the fourth successive Olympics where Russians are competing under an acronym. Before its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was already being sanctioned on the international sporting stage for a state-sponsored doping scandal. The last time it was able to compete at an Olympics under its own flag and with its own anthem was at the 2016 Rio Games. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Tokyo 2020 Summer Games, Russians who could prove they were clean competed as ROC (Russian Olympic Committee), while at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, they competed as OARs (Olympic Athletes of Russia). As ROC and OAR, they appeared as a group in the medal tables. But as AINs they will not - firstly because the IOC is not including their medals in their table of nations, but in any case they are individuals rather than a team. The IOC initially banned Russian and Belarusian athletes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Belarus is a close ally of Russia and supports its war in Ukraine. The IOC later decided athletes from the two countries would be able to participate as neutrals if they met strict eligibility conditions, saying that letting individuals take part was about ""respecting human rights"". Among the conditions are: Athletes must not actively support the war  Athletes must not be contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies (many Russian sports clubs have direct links to the military and security services) No teams are allowed Athletes had to qualify for the Games and then pass a double vetting check - first by their international sports federation and then by the IOC, which set up an Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel (AINERP) to evaluate eligibility against those conditions.  If they passed the checks, they were then invited by the IOC to participate at the Games. There will be no AIN track and field athletes because World Athletics has banned all Russians and Belarusians. The International Olympic Committee said last year it was expecting a maximum of 55 Russians and 28 Belarusians at Paris 2024, with 36 and 22 respectively the ""most probable scenario"". Just 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians have accepted invitations. That is in stark contrast to Tokyo 2020, where the ROC was one of the largest delegations with 335 competitors across 30 sports. They finished fifth in the medal table in Tokyo with 71 medals (20 gold, 28 silver, 23 bronze). Russia has dominated some events for many years and so the absence of so many of its competitors will open up chances for other countries.  This includes, for example, artistic swimming where Russians have won both the team and duet gold medals at the past six Games, and rhythmic gymnastics where Russia have won team and individual gold in five out of the past six Olympics.  Former world number one tennis player Daniil Medvedev is the most high-profile Russian set to take part. Also among the 15 Russians to accept an invitation are a further six tennis players, one trampoline gymnast, three canoeists, three road cyclists and one swimmer.  According to the IOC, nine of 10 invited wrestlers had initially accepted an invitation but have subsequently declined. The other declined immediately. Among the 21 to have turned down invitations are tennis players Andrey Rublev, Karen Khachanov and Daria Kasatkina and road cyclist Aleksandr Vlasov. Meanwhile, among the 17 Belarusians to accept an invitation is Ivan Litvinovich, who will be defending his men's trampoline title.  He is joined by another trampoline gymnast, three swimmers, two canoeists, two shooters, two rowers, two wrestlers, two weightlifters, one road cyclist and one taekwondo athlete. Among the seven Belarusians to have declined are two-time Grand Slam tennis champions Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka.  If an AIN is on the podium, the teal and white flag featuring the AIN logo will be raised at the medal ceremony.   Athletes may use this emblem on their kit, which must otherwise be white or unicolour.  The athletes cannot display any Russian or Belarusian colours, flags or emblems - and these are also banned from the venues.    You will not hear the Russian or Belarusian national anthems at medal ceremonies at Paris 2024. If an AIN wins gold then a specially written anthem with no lyrics will be played. No Russian or Belarusian government or state officials have been invited to or accredited for these Olympics. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last year that while he was in favour of Russians competing at the Games, a further assessment was needed of what the neutral status would mean for his country's athletes. ""If the IOC's artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all,"" he said. That was similar to the sentiment expressed by the Russian judo federation - a sport in which Putin himself is a black belt - when it said rejected any selection method ""aimed at... breaking the spirit of Russian athletes"". Russia has been critical of the IOC and its restrictions on its athletes, with its foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying the sporting body had ""slipped into racism and neo-Nazism"". When it announced its decision to allow AINs at the Games, the IOC said one of its considerations had been that an ""overwhelming majority of athletes"" did not want to ""punish fellow athletes for the actions of their government"". Ukraine's National Olympic Committee issued recommendations in May urging its athletes to avoid contact with Russians and Belarusians at Paris 2024 so that possible ""provocative actions"" can be prevented. Its recommendations also suggested Ukrainian athletes should not take part in news conferences or interviews with athletes from the two countries and to avoid being photographed with them at medal ceremonies.  Many Ukrainian athletes have already been avoiding handshakes with Russian and Belarusian opponents since the invasion.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last year that allowing Russia to compete at the Olympics would amount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable"", adding that there is no neutrality in sport while his country's athletes are dying on the battlefield. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said in March that Russian and Belarusian athletes were ""not welcome"" at the Games. The UK government, which had previously supported the IOC's ban on Russians and Belarusians, expressed support in April for the IOC's decision to allow them to compete in Paris as neutrals."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4yv7nv8xlo,Fined for yellow and blue shoes: How Russian laws smother dissent,"Since the invasion of Ukraine, the measures used to clamp down on Kremlin critics have swelled.",21 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.234373,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia.  For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution. The repressive nature of the punishments, often disproportionate to the offence, harks back to the methods of the old Soviet Union. The law used most widely against critics of the war in Ukraine is the criminal offence of spreading ""deliberately false information"" about the Russian army. It was rushed through parliament shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was ""urgently needed because of the absolutely unprecedented information war waged against our country"". According to prominent Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 300 people have since been charged or convicted under it. Even though the law mentions ""false"" information, it has been used against people  who highlight crimes that are well-documented but denied by Russia. Ilya Yashin is one of the most high-profile critics of the war to be convicted under this law. The former head of a Moscow disctrict council was given eight and half years in jail for a live stream on YouTube in which he urged an investigation into the murder of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading ""false information"" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools. The law has also been applied to Russians with far smaller public profiles. Russian-language tutor Raisa Boldova, 61, was handed a suspended one-year community service sentence for posting critical comments about attacks on civilians in Ukraine, including the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital.  In an echo of a chilling Soviet practice of confining dissidents to mental hospitals, the court also ordered her to undergo a compulsory psychiatric evaluation. Another recent law penalises ""discrediting"" the Russian army, and it has been applied to a broad variety of actions interpreted either as support for Ukraine or criticism of the war. These include: A village priest in Kostroma region was fined for discrediting Russia's armed forces after praying for peace and mentioning the sixth commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"". Russia's ""foreign agents"" law allows restrictions to be imposed on critics without convicting them of any wrongdoing.  Individuals or organisations that have criticised or scrutinised government policies are targeted if they are deemed to have received money from abroad - even from a relative - or merely to be under ""foreign influence"". The label has to be attached to all public communications, a practice designed to undermine trust in them and one that resembles the Soviet practice of branding dissidents ""enemies of the people"". Among Russia's ""foreign agents"" are election monitor Golos, prominent pollster Levada Centre, rights group OVD-Info, a movement of wives of mobilised soldiers called The Way Home and numerous independent news websites and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov. Books written by so-called foreign agents have started to disappear from shops and libraries. A ""foreign agent"" label can make life difficult – but being declared ""undesirable"" amounts to an outright ban. All manner of organisations have been banned from Russia in this way – from the NGO Greenpeace to London-based think-tank Chatham House, as well as a number of key Russian media outlets. Late opposition leader Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation was disbanded after being declared “extremist” – another label used to effectively erase individuals and organisations from public life.  Navalny himself was handed a lengthy prison sentence and died in jail in February 2024. His widow says he was killed by President Putin. Several of Navalny's lawyers were themselves arrested on charges of extremism. In Russia, anyone who wishes to hold a demonstration needs permission from the authorities. If the rally is critical of the government, that is practically impossible. ""One-person pickets"" are allowed, but many are regularly shut down - ostensibly because of Covid restrictions. One man was fined for wearing blue-and-yellow shoes - seen as a violation of laws regulating political demonstrations. And a journalist from Vologda Region, Antonida Smolina, was visited by police after someone complained about photographs she had posted online showing her posing in a yellow coat against a blue sky. Other actions outlawed in Russia include ""disrespect"" for the authorities and calls for sanctions to be imposed on the country. According to Natalia Prilutskaya of Amnesty International, the Kremlin uses laws to “legitimise repression”, partly by exploiting the vague wording of some Russian laws. ""This vagueness allows law enforcement structures to qualify basically any activity as a forbidden activity, or at least it makes it easier,"" Ms Prilutskaya told the BBC. Dmitrii Anisimov, spokesman for Russian human rights group OVD-Info, argues that laws are a particularly important for the Kremlin because of the way Russia's security apparatus functions. ""The Russian security community is fairly bureaucratic and it needs legal norms for their actions,” he said. Legislation used by the security services had been “deliberately designed in a way that makes their application simple and widespread”, he added. Ms Prilutskaya says it all adds up to a general climate of repression, which she blames on President Vladimir Putin. ""The ambitions of one person have brought Russia to the edge of a really deep abyss,” she said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p26qjgjjwo,Lammy aims to reset UK-India ties with early trip,The foreign secretary wants to boost relations amid instability among American and European allies.,24 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.332105,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"India can be tricky territory for Labour.  Prime Minister Clement Attlee was criticised for allowing partition to be rushed at terrible cost in human life.  Foreign Secretary Robin Cook caused a storm by offering to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And the party led by Jeremy Corbyn angered even more here when it passed a motion calling for international intervention in the disputed region. So it must have been with some trepidation that David Lammy arrived in a warm and damp New Delhi on Wednesday morning, a newly-minted foreign secretary stepping away for the first time from the more familiar turf of Europe and the United States.  His trip oozed caution. The announcements were uncontroversial; both countries agreed a new tech security partnership.  His words in interviews were safe and measured, eulogising India as a “superpower” and “indispensable partner”.  Mr Lammy’s programme even included a tree planting ceremony at the British residence. Radical this was not. Yet the nature of the trip was less important than the sheer fact of it.  This was a British foreign secretary in a new government, making a point of visiting India in his third week in office.  Mr Lammy held talks with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. More than that, he also secured a prized meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a head of government who rarely deigns to trouble himself with mere foreign ministers.  And all this while Mr Modi’s new coalition government was busy dealing with the fallout from its first budget. In other words, this was a meeting both sides wanted and were prepared to make time for.  For Labour, the primary focus was trade. If it wants the UK's economy to grow, then it will need British firms to do more business with Indian partners.  India’s economy is on course to become the world’s third largest by the end of the decade. Yet it is only the UK's 12th largest trading partner. “There is so much we can do with this global superpower,” Mr Lammy told me.  “We have a long-standing history, a longstanding relationship, and it is a win-win for both of our economies.”  He said Britain would work with India to agree a new free trade deal “in the coming months”, negotiations that have been stalled for much of the year as both countries held elections. “Being here in India is essential. We have shared interest with India. It is a growing economy. It is going to be the third largest by the end of this decade. It is hugely important that we deepen and grow our ties.” But this trip was not just about economics. There was broader geopolitics too.  Mr Lammy wants to reset Britain’s relations with the so-called Global South. India sees itself as key player in this loose group of developing nations.  And that, Mr Lammy says, involves less lecturing by Britain and more listening.  He was keen to talk about shared interests on green technology and shared threats in the Indo-Pacific, namely China.  He was less keen to talk about his hosts subsidising Russia’s war machine in Ukraine by buying many tanker loads of cheap Russian oil and gas.  “Across the democratic community, there will always be differences of opinion,” he averred. Which is one way of excusing an ally for aiding an enemy. The subtext to all this - implicit rather than explicit - was that with so much political instability among Britain’s traditional allies on both sides of the Atlantic, the government was keen to revive and reset – to use Mr Lammy’s favoured phrase – its relations with other allies. And India is the biggest prize. He said Britain’s relationship with India had been “underperforming” but both countries’ interests were aligned on many issues. He said the UK must cooperate with India “in this tough, geopolitically-challenging time”. For Indian ministers, Mr Lammy’s trip was seen as good moment to invest in a British government that may be in power for some time.  It was also a chance to refocus the UK on the possibility of a trade deal between the two countries - which India hopes would force the UK to relax its visa regime for Indian students and business professionals. They clearly welcomed the fact Mr Lammy had made an early visit, and had brought a plane-load of tech entrepreneurs with him. Away from the economics, there was also some unstated politics.  India has just lost in Rishi Sunak a British prime minister of Asian origin with close family links to the country.  Labour was aware of that, and wanted to fill the gap quickly.  The Jeremy Corbyn era is also still fresh is some Indian minds, and Mr Lammy’s early trip will come as some reassurance. This trip to the subcontinent was hot and humid. Mr Lammy’s suit was too dark and thick. But the great-grandson of a lady from Calcutta will probably think it was worth the sweat in diplomatic gain. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwydq0wd5vo,Political change and conflict backdrop for airshow,The aviation industry will pitch itself to the new government at this week's Farnborough Airshow.,21 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.433614,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Britain's aviation industry will be pitching itself to the new government as one of the engines for economic growth at this week's Farnborough Airshow. Aviation, defence and space are all major players in Britain's economy and sectors where the UK remains a significant presence on the world stage. But this year's show is expected to see military plane makers taking a more central role than they have done since the end of the Cold War, due to conflicts and potential flashpoints from Ukraine through the Middle East to the South China Sea. The industry is also trying to demonstrate that flying can be made more sustainable, despite its current reliance on fossil fuels. Farnborough may have started out as a British affair, but these days it is very much a global market.  This year's show is the first to sell out in two decades and the 1,500 exhibitors come from 40 different countries. But home-grown talent will be hoping to sell itself to a string of senior politicians from the new Labour government who are expected to visit the show. Farnborough International CEO Gareth Rogers said ""high-value manufacturing"" is a feature of aerospace and defence across the UK. ""Growth in these industries is really important for the GDP of UK plc,"" he said. ""That will be the overriding message to the ministers who attend."" His view has been echoed by the Farnborough Aerospace Consortium, which represents hundreds of British firms in the sector. It said they ""stand ready to contribute to the economic growth ambitions of the government"". CEO Alan Fisher said: ""In the defence sector it is important that the new government understands the importance that business plays in supporting our world class army, navy and air force.  ""So a certainty about defence budgets is desirable."" Ministers have pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5% of the economy, but have yet to set out a timetable for the change. They have also launched a defence review. Britain is not alone in looking afresh at its military spending in the face of growing instability. The show will halt a trend since the fall of the Berlin Wall that saw the industry increasingly looking to civil markets to keep up profits. Russian aircraft, which thrilled the crowds after the collapse of the Soviet Union, are no longer welcome since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. For the first time Boeing, best known for its airliners, will not be bringing any of them to the show. Instead it will be displaying two F15 fighters, one in so-called ""dirty"" condition with a full weapon load.  The US Air Force meanwhile is bringing one of the firm's cold war vintage B52 bombers, which remain in frontline service. ""The military presence represents about 40% of the flying display,"" according to Joe Muir, the show's commercial director. ""I think really that's a reflection of how important and prominent defence has become in the world at the moment."" Sustainability remains a big focus for the industry. As well as looking at replacements for fossil-based jets fuels, the exhibition halls have been fitted with solar panels and even delegates' badges have switched from plastic to paper, in a move critics have described as greenwashing. But while show organisers insist the issue has not slipped down the agenda, CEO Gareth Rogers admitted: ""It's just that other externalities, as it were, are now up there alongside it."""

Other iconic venues such as the Stade de France - the national stadium - and French Open tennis venue Roland Garros will host events, alongside historic sites such as the Grand Palais and the Place de la Concorde. One of the big concerns in the build-up was the water quality of the Seine, which will host the swimming leg of the triathlon and open-water events. Swimming in the river was banned for a century because of the water quality, with tests in June still showing levels of E.coli above the upper limits imposed by sports federations. However, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river on 17 July to try to prove it was safe. The water will be tested regularly in different areas before the events.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljy57r64jlo,Anxiety at Aspen over Ukraine and Trump,Concerns surrounded the question of whether America’s support for Ukraine would continue.,20 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.613672,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"America’s national security community made its annual pilgrimage to the mountains of Aspen in Colorado this week for a gathering notable for a looming feeling of anxiety. One reason is that the world is more dangerous and contested than in previous years with war in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as tensions in Asia. But the issues discussed at the Aspen Security Forum also were overshadowed by political events that may define much of what happens next. With Donald Trump accepting the US presidential nomination during the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin and questions over whether President Biden will be forced to stand aside, there was a concern that time may be running out not just for the current administration, but for the wider approach to foreign policy, which has guided America in recent years. Allies are looking toward November's election with ''angst'' about how much they can continue to count on American leadership, Douglas Lute, a former ambassador to NATO said at the forum. Specifically, anxiety surrounded the question of whether America’s support for Ukraine would continue. November’s presidential election comes at a moment when the war may be shifting so that it will less be about major gains on the battlefield and more a test of wills between Russia and Ukraine, and its allies as to who can keep going. Trump has suggested he might push for a deal, which Ukraine and its allies fear may serve Russia’s interests more than their own. The selection of JD Vance as Trump’s running mate heightened concerns about the future of America’s commitment since Mr Vance has advocated for reducing spending on Ukraine, shifting America’s focus away from Europe, and focusing on confronting China. British officials and ministers were absent from Aspen, but officials from other European countries stressed the importance of continued US engagement with Ukraine.  “Our house is on fire in Europe. The war in Ukraine is existential,"" Jonatan Vseviov, from Estonia’s Foreign Ministry told the conference. While US military officers were wary of being drawn into politics, some sounded almost as if they were already preparing a case to make to a possible Trump administration, knowing that it likely would pressure NATO allies to increase their spending and take up a greater burden on Ukraine. General Christopher Cavoli, America’s top general in Europe, said continued US commitment to NATO was important because European partners had changed their behaviour in recent years.  ""This is a Europe that recognizes what the burden is and that it has got to be shared ... this is exactly the partner that we have been looking for for three decades,” he said.  The moderator responded that they hoped someone was livestreaming his answer to the Republican convention. There was recognition that the Republican Party’s foreign policy shift away from a more internationalist perspective went deeper than just Donald Trump.   One reason discussed at the meeting, was that the international order America built through globalisation and free trade did not always deliver benefits for American workers. That sparked domestic backlash, undermining support for continued engagement, not just in Ukraine, but more broadly.  Calls to reduce funding for Ukraine and act more unilaterally have been growing within the Republican Party. Former Republican Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said she was’ concerned’.   She made the case that, for the US, standing firm in Ukraine would send an important message to China. “I understand that a lot of people want to focus now just on China, but ….we have to keep driving home that credibility is not divisible. So what you do in Ukraine is actually going to matter to (China’s leader) Xi Jinping,” she said. That view was echoed by General CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US military.  “We have credibility at stake,” he said. “Ukraine matters. Unprovoked aggression in one part of the world does not stay in one part of the world.” But Ms Rice said she also recognised that American public opinion had changed and some previous commitments were unsustainable. “We have to realize that some of these engagements are going to be hard to sustain over a long period of time. I don't know if any American president …. can sustain 60 billion (dollar) packages to Ukraine every six months,” she said. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan closed the forum stressing that the Biden administration has put considerable effort into building alliances in Europe and Asia.  The reservoir of support for Ukraine in Congress and among the public was strong enough to survive any political headwinds, he said. Mr Sullivan also pointed out that international commitments had been secured for Ukraine to sustain support in the long term. “It’s a very good feeling,” Mr Sullivan joked when asked if it was good to be out of Washington, even as journalists pressed him on President Biden’s ability to go on for another four years in office. The Aspen foreign policy elite can feel like a bubble but in the fresh mountain air there was a sense that foreign affairs was not going to be immune from change. And whatever the result of November’s election, with a more dangerous world, the path ahead looked uncertain."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1j8dvw73lo,Why tech bros are turning to Trump,The Republican presidential candidate is forging new alliances as his campaign gains momentum.,24 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:25.712228,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump, whose time in office made him a pariah to many in the business world, has found new champions among tech leaders as his path back to the White House takes shape. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, became the biggest name yet to throw his weight behind the former president this month, endorsing him and getting involved in fundraising efforts. The move capped weeks of mounting support from the tech world, as influential venture capitalists and tech leaders, including former Democratic donor Allison Huynh, investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and the Winklevoss twins, players in the world of crypto, rallied publicly around Trump. Support for Trump is hardly universal.  But it marks a sharp turn from just a few years ago, when companies rushed to distance themselves from Trump in the weeks after the 2021 US Capitol riot.  Coming from Silicon Valley, where backing a ban on gay marriage - a Republican cause - once cost an executive his job, the change is especially striking. At a cryptocurrency event at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Nicholas Longo, 27, of wealth management firm Fortuna Investors, said when he voted for Trump four years ago he felt there was stigma attached. ""In 2020, it would have been inadvisable for me to express support for Donald Trump,” he said. Now, all that has changed. The shift in the political winds has long been evident on social media, where Mr Musk and investor David Sacks are among those to regularly scorn President Joe Biden.  But their decision to open their wallets to the Trump campaign is poised to significantly expand their influence beyond their traditional circle - with major consequences for the election. The support from tech leaders has helped Trump close the fundraising gap that he faced against Mr Biden a few months ago.  ""He was pretty far behind and struggling at the end of April,""  said Sarah Bryner, research director at OpenSecrets. ""In the last eight weeks, it's a completely different campaign.""  She said the pledges sent a strong signal on how the tide is turning, noting that signs of victory at the polls often help push potential donors off the fence.  ""Success begets success,"" she said.  Data from OpenSecrets shows Democrats claiming the larger share of venture capitalist donations in recent elections - and Mr Biden's decision to bow out of the race is expected to ignite further interest. However, Trump's new friends remain committed.  According to the Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Mr Musk pledged $45m a month to the Trump campaign - which would make him one of the biggest donors this year.  The billionaire has acknowledged his work on fundraising efforts tied to the campaign, but denied the sum, saying his contributions will be at a ""much lower level"". ""I believe in an America that maximizes individual freedom and merit. That used to be the Democratic Party, but now the pendulum has swung to the Republican Party,"" Mr Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns that was formerly known as Twitter, after Mr Biden dropped out.  Analysts said the backing from key figures in the tech world suggested that Trump was widening his appeal. ""He's convinced Republicans he's not as bad as they say... and now we're seeing that's broadening out,"" said Sal Russo, a veteran Republican consultant based in California. ""Do I think he's going to win Santa Clara County? No, but he's going to do better,"" said Mr Russo. Tech leaders have said they are concerned about the Biden administration's crackdown on crypto, and cautious approach to artificial intelligence. For example, a recent executive order requires firms to comply with government AI safety standards. ""Bad government policies are now the #1 threat to Little Tech,"" Mr Andreessen and Mr Horowitz, whose firm invests in start-ups and is a big player in crypto and AI, wrote in a recent essay. ""The time has come to stand up."" Mr Musk's decision to back Trump might appear a startling shift for a man who had historically shunned political donations. He reportedly once waited in line for six hours to shake Barack Obama’s hand, and as recently as 2018 described himself as politically moderate. In 2017, he was among the first members to quit a White House business council, parting ways with Trump over climate change policies.  His company, Tesla, makes electric cars, which Trump has repeatedly criticised as expensive and impractical.  However, Mr Musk has long bristled at oversight by financial regulators. His criticism of Mr Biden ramped up two years ago, after he did not get an invite to a White House business meeting, a snub that led him to tell CNBC he felt unfairly ""ignored"".  On social media, he has increasingly waded into other debates over Covid lockdowns, the war in Ukraine, China policy and transgender issues.  Mr Musk, whose SpaceX rocket firm does billions of dollars of government business, has a relationship with a possible Trump administration to consider as well. Democrats said the shift in the tech world has been motivated by self-interest, noting that Mr Biden has proposed new taxes on multi-millionaires and unrealised capital gains.  He has also alienated some with his embrace of organised labour, and his administration's pursuit of tech companies in anti-monopoly and other cases.  Businessman Mark Cuban, who supports Democrats, suggested that the gravitation towards Trump was a ""bitcoin play"" - a bet that cryptocurrency value could be boosted by high inflation and political chaos that Democrats say would result under a Trump administration. Stanford Business School professor Neil Malhotra, who has studied the political views of tech founders, said it would be a mistake to conflate the ""most vocal people on Twitter"" with the industry overall - or even its elites, whose views historically have straddled both parties. A 2017 survey he and colleagues conducted found that as a group, tech leaders   were aligned with Democrats on issues such as gay marriage and abortion - even taxes. However, they swung Republican in strongly opposing regulation. He noted that since the survey, new social issues such as policing, schooling and transgender rights have come to the fore. San Francisco has been a key battleground in those debates, driving some of the tech world backlash.  ""The suspicion is that most people in venture capital are still centre-left,"" Prof Malhotra said. But, he added: ""There’s definitely a movement to the Republican Party."" Evan Swarztrauber, an adviser to the Foundation for American Innovation thinktank, said tech leaders were betting Trump would be more hands-off on crypto and AI. But the gamble is not without risk.  As president, Trump won praise from the business community by cutting taxes, putting anti-labour officials in charge of labour rights and generally veering away from regulation. But he also took a markedly more interventionist approach to the economy - and to tech - than previous administrations - starting a trade war with China, ordering a TikTok ban, and launching some of the ongoing anti-monopoly lawsuits against tech companies. Since then, he has pushed the Republican party further in that direction - while at the same time moderating or reversing himself on issues such as the TikTok ban and crypto. Jennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow in tech policy for the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump may be shifting his stance on some tech issues, noting that he is now the owner of a social media platform. JD Vance, Trump's choice for vice-president, also previously worked in venture capital and got key support from PayPal's Peter Thiel during his 2022 senate campaign. But she warned that the effort to distinguish between the interests of ""big"" tech and ""little"" tech would prove difficult when it comes time to govern. David Broockman, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said Trump was finding success in the business world by presenting himself as more moderate than other members of his party on social issues such as abortion. After boasting of being ""proudly the person responsible"" for removing Roe v Wade protections, Trump has rejected claims he will back a national ban pushed by many conservatives, and says the matter should be left up to the states. But Prof Broockman noted that Trump also ran a relatively moderate campaign in 2016, only to adopt more extreme policies once in office.  Those hurt his public approval and eventually frayed Republican ties to Wall Street, a traditional source of support for the party.  ""Tech and other business leaders are banking on a lot of Trump's more eccentric policy ideas ... just not happening,"" Prof Broockman said. ""But they really could happen."" Outside of tech, Trump has backed radical changes including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, a dramatic reduction in the government workforce and a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the country. But Garrett Johnson, co-founder of the Foundation for American Innovation and now an executive at a venture-backed tech firm, said he thought that as time had passed more tech and business elites have come around to Trump's views. ""Trump singlehandedly made the threat that China poses to our country a national topic,"" he said. ""He was right and everyone else had to come along."" ""So absolutely I think that is part of the dynamic, of the vibe shift,"" he said. ""Was he right on everything? No, but on many big issues Trump was right.""

Iryna Farion caused controversy in 2023 by suggesting that “true patriots” of Ukraine should not speak Russian under any circumstances. The 60-year-old linguistic professor's killing on Friday is being investigated and police say it may have been a targeted attack. Her attacker has not been identified. Police say a power outage affected CCTV in the area. Lviv regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram that Ms Farion died in hospital after the shooting. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said “this was not a spontaneous killing” and police were looking for a motive. ""We already have several versions. The main ones, I can say, are [linked to Farion's] social and political activities and personal dislike,"" he said in a statement via the Telegram message service. ""We do not rule out that the murder has a commissioned character,"" he added. On Saturday President Volodymyr Zelensky said a major police operation was under way. ""All versions are being investigated, including the one that leads to Russia,"" he said. The hardline nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) political party Ms Farion was a member of blamed Russia directly for the killing. ""Moscow shoots in the temple for the Ukrainian language,"" it said in a statement. In 2023, Ms Farion said that true patriots of Ukraine should not speak Russian in any settings, including on the front lines, as it is the language of the aggressor country. She described Russian as ""the language of the enemy, who kills, discriminates, insults and rapes me"", and added: ""How crazy should you be to fight in the Ukrainian army and speak Russian?"" Her words provoked a strong reaction in Ukraine at the time, with people accusing her of inciting hatred based on linguistic preferences. She was dismissed from a university in western Ukraine and was investigated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).  In May, the Lviv Court of Appeal reportedly issued a ruling reinstating her to the position."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm52jvn41l7o,Zelensky urges PM to help lift Ukraine weapon limits,The Ukrainian president is the first foreign leader to address the cabinet in person since 1997.,19 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:34.838780,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged Sir Keir Starmer to ""show your leadership"" by helping to remove restrictions on how Ukraine can use weapons supplied by its western allies.  Addressing a meeting of the cabinet in Downing Street, Mr Zelensky said being able to hit Russian territory would help prevent attacks on residential areas in Ukraine.  Pressed on the subject earlier, Defence Secretary John Healey said the UK's provision of weapons to Ukraine ""does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia"". However, he added that it ""must be done by the Ukrainians and must be done within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was having ""intense discussions"" on the ""complex questions"", but said he would not go into the details in public.  During his visit to Downing Street, Mr Zelensky also thanked the British government for its ongoing support, which he said would help bring an end to the war with Russia.  He was greeted to the cabinet room with a standing ovation from senior ministers. It was the first time a foreign leader has addressed the cabinet in person since US President Bill Clinton in 1997.  Sir Keir promised to “double down” on support for Ukraine and told Mr Zelensky the ""political resolve to stand with Ukraine was not just in Parliament, but across this country”. He also said he had accepted an invitation to visit Ukraine in the future. In June, Ukraine was given permission to use Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia. Previously it had only been allowed to target occupied territories inside Ukraine. However, the permission does not extend to long-range weapons, which could be used to hit military bases well inside Russia.   That means Ukraine is restricted to hitting targets near its border. Earlier this month, a children's hospital in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv was hit after Russia launched a wave of missile strikes against Ukrainian cities.  During the cabinet meeting, Mr Zelensky told senior ministers that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""must pay"" for his ""disregard for human life"".  ""How can we ensure this? Right now we are missing the main answer to this question - that is our long-range capability. ""Show your leadership in this and please convince other partners to remove the limits. ""We need this step - that will force Russia to seek peace."" During his visit to No 10, Mr Zelensky signed a defence export support treaty aimed at helping Ukrainian and UK defence companies to invest in further military capabilities.  It followed Thursday's meeting of the European Political Community at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, where the continent's leaders agreed to tackle Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet"" - 600 tankers evading sanctions on Russian oil. The vessels carry around 1.7 million barrels of oil per day. Some are also believed to be transporting weapons to Russia or acting as Russian listening stations. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c97d1628y9no,"Biles, Djokovic & Lyles - global stars to follow at Paris 2024","Novak Djokovic, Simone Biles and Noah Lyles are among the biggest names in Paris 2024.",25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:34.919934,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Novak Djokovic, Simone Biles and Noah Lyles are among the biggest names in Paris About 10,500 athletes from around the world will compete in 32 sports at the Olympic Games in Paris this summer. BBC Sport looked at Team GB's hopes earlier this week, so now we are putting the spotlight on the big stars, stories and stats from a global perspective.  The five-time world champion is set to be one the faces of the Games and is tipped to deliver multiple gold medals in the pool. When 22-year-old Marchand is not studying computer science at university in the United States, he has been breaking records for fun. That included the great Michael Phelps' 400m individual medley world record - which had stood for 15 years - in 2023. The son of two Olympic swimmers, Marchand is world champion in the 200m individual medley, 400m individual medley and 200m butterfly. He is aiming to become the first swimmer to win the 200m breaststroke and 200m butterfly double at the Olympics - but to do so will have to race in the two events on the same days. In all, Marchand, who is coached by Phelps' former coach, will have the chance for four individual gold medals in front of his home fans. Three years ago many people thought they might have seen the world's most decorated gymnast at an Olympics for the last time. Biles pulled out of several events at the Tokyo Games after suffering with the 'twisties' - a loss of spatial awareness while performing twisting moves - when she was favourite to add to her four Olympic gold medals. She made an emotional return to win bronze on the beam, her seventh Olympic medal. She then took time away from the sport before returning to competition in June 2023. Biles has since added five World Championship medals, including four golds, and has been working regularly with a therapist. ""I feel very confident with where I'm at mentally and physically, that [Tokyo] is not going to happen again just because we have put in the work,"" she said this year. An Olympic gold is the only big prize missing from 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's collection. He has made no secret that being on top of the podium at Paris 2024 is his main goal this year. At Tokyo 2020, when on course for a 'Golden Slam' - all four majors plus Olympic gold - he lost to eventual champion Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals and was also defeated in the bronze medal match. Djokovic has a history of bouncing back after adversity and will be expected to feed off that huge disappointment this time round. But the 37-year-old is not having his best year, failing to win a title and no longer sitting top of the world rankings. Injury cut short his French Open before the quarter-finals and, although he reached the Wimbledon final this month with strapping on a knee, he was comprehensively outplayed by Carlos Alcaraz. However, if he is fit, an improvement on the bronze he won at Beijing 2008 could well be on the cards. Can anyone stop the seven-time Olympic champion? Set to appear at her fourth Games, 27-year-old Ledecky is one gold medal away from drawing level with compatriot Jenny Thompson as the most successful female Olympic swimmer of all time. She has the chance to claim the record outright as she is expected to compete in four events - 400m freestyle, 800m freestyle, 1500m freestyle and 4x200m relay. With 10 medals already, Ledecky can also break Thompson's record of 12 for the most won by an American woman. Ledecky is favourite to defend the 800m and 1500 freestyle titles - events where she is also the world record holder. There is a tiny glimmer of hope for her rivals, however, with Ledecky suffering her first defeat in 13 years in an 800m freestyle final in February when she was stunned by Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh.  The American sprinter has set himself some huge goals. He is aiming to become the first man to win four gold medals on the track at the same Olympics, targeting success in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m and 4x400m relays. He won gold in the first three of those events at the World Championships last year and is hoping to claim a place in the 4x400m team after making his debut in the event at the indoor Worlds. As if that isn't enough, he has also spoken of wanting to beat Jamaican great Usain Bolt's 100m and 200m world records. Since taking 200m bronze at Tokyo 2020, Lyles has dominated the sprints on the global stage and displays the talent and flamboyance that could fill the void left by Bolt when he retired in 2017. A double Olympic 1500m champion and the world record holder over the distance, Kipyegon has said she is ""looking forward to a bright summer"". The 30-year-old is chasing two gold medals in Paris as she seeks to repeat the 1500m-5,000m double she achieved at last year's World Championships. She is also a former 5,000m world record holder, setting her mark in Paris last year in her first race over the distance in eight years. It has since been beaten by Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay.  Kipyegon began her athletics career at 16 and won her first individual global title running barefoot at the World Junior Cross Country Championships in 2011. She has spoken about how becoming a mother in 2018 has changed her mentality. Three of her four world titles have come since giving birth. Dupont made headlines last year when he announced he was swapping XVs for sevens to fulfil a dream of playing at a home Olympics. Regarded by many as the best player in the world at the XV-a-side game, France captain and scrum-half Dupont sat out this year's Six Nations to focus on the World Rugby sevens circuit. He inspired France to their first men's sevens title in 19 years in Los Angeles in March, having helped them to bronze in his debut tournament in Vancouver. ""We're a very ambitious squad who are looking to claim a gold medal. We're all aiming for it,"" the 27-year-old said. Other sides boast better credentials. Since sevens was introduced at the Games in 2016, Fiji have won both men's gold medals. France were beaten by Japan in the quarter-finals at Rio 2016 and did not qualify for Tokyo 2020. However, France have already secured a place in the quarter-finals in Paris - where the sevens action started on Wednesday - and Dupont scored a stunning solo try to underline why he is one of the faces of these Games. He has superstar status in India and nine million Instagram followers. The first Indian athlete to win an Olympic track and field gold, Chopra will be aiming to defend his javelin title in Paris. His stunning success in Tokyo, where he also became the first Asian athlete to win Olympic javelin gold, has since been backed up by a world title. Among those likely to challenge him are Arshad Nadeem from Pakistan - India's great sporting rivals. Nadeem boasts his own slice of history after becoming the first athlete from Pakistan to qualify for an Olympic track and field final at Tokyo 2020. He took silver behind Chopra at last year's World Championships and can become his country's first Olympic medallist in athletics. The four-time world champion was in danger of missing the Games because of a ban imposed for refusing to shake the hand of a Russian opponent. Kharlan was disqualified from last year's World Championships after offering her sabre to tap blades instead of shaking hands following victory over Anna Smirnova.  But International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach wrote a letter to Kharlan saying it would ""allocate an additional quota place"" to her if she could not qualify because of her ""unique situation"". The four-time Olympic medallist has pledged to bring ""hope"" to Ukrainians amid the ongoing war following Russia's invasion more than two years ago. No Russian or Belarusian fencers have been invited to participate as neutral athletes in Paris, a situation 33-year-old Kharlan described as ""a success"". NBA great Stephen Curry will make his Olympic debut in Paris. The Golden State Warriors point guard is part of star-studded USA men's team who will be aiming to add to their 16 Olympic gold medals. They have won every gold since 2004. An Olympic medal is pretty much the only thing missing from Curry's collection, which includes four NBA titles, two NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards and two World Cups. He is also the NBAâs all-time three-point record holder. LeBron James, the all-time NBA leading points scorer, will play at the Games for the first time since London 2012, while Kevin Durant is seeking to become the first male athlete to win four basketball gold medals. She is 37 and has had an up-and-down season but count out Fraser-Pryce at your peril in her fifth and final Olympics. ""Itâs never over until itâs over,"" the three-time Olympic champion said this month. Five-time 100m world champion Fraser-Pryce has struggled with injuries this season but will compete in her signature event in Paris along with team-mate Shericka Jackson, who is chasing her first individual Olympic gold medal. They will be in the 4x100m relay team as Jamaica seek to defend their title. German equestrian athlete Isabell Werth, 55, has never failed to win a gold medal at any Olympics she has competed at. Heading to her seventh Games, she will be hoping to add to her seven golds and five silvers and extend her record as the most decorated rider in Olympic history. Georgian pistol shooter Nino Salukvadze, who is also 55, will feature at her 10th Olympics, equalling the record held by Canadian equestrian athlete Ian Millar. Salukvadze will be the first to do so in consecutive Games. In Greco-Roman wrestling, Cuba's Mijain Lopez could become the first athlete in any sport to win five individual golds consecutively. Australian Jess Fox has been dominating canoe slalom and, with the new discipline of kayak cross, may become the first person to win three canoe golds at the same Games. In table tennis, Bruna Alexandre of Brazil will be in the women's singles at the Olympics before competing at the Paralympics to become only the second athlete in her sport to achieve the feat after Natalia Partyka. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/extra/xawtd9l5mx/visual-guide-to-the-olympics"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng4pj43ndo,Air strikes can’t stop the music at this Ukrainian festival,The organisers of the war-hit country's largest music event say they've missed the festival feeling.,20 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:34.996017,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"How do you stage a music festival for 25,000 people when you're under threat from a potential Russian missile attack? That's a question Vlad Yaremchuk has been trying to answer for the past few months. He's the programme director of Atlas United, Ukraine's biggest music festival. The event's due to return this weekend for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. But it's not quite business as usual - this year's event has relocated to a shopping mall in case of an airstrike. When Vlad speaks to BBC Newsbeat, Atlas has just been pushed back a week after a series of deadly missile attacks, including one that hit a children's hospital. He admits that there's been a lot of stress in the lead-up to this year's event, but he's optimistic about it going ahead. ""To finally see people coming into the festival for the first time will be exciting,"" he says.  ""We've really missed that feeling."" Since it began in 2015 Atlas, held in Ukrainian capital Kyiv, has hosted huge names such as Kasabian, The Chemical Brothers and Liam Gallagher. Organising a big festival takes time, but Vlad says they only got the go-ahead for 2024's event this spring. ""Normally for a festival of this size you would need a year or more to organise it,"" he says.  ""We didn't even expect to have a chance to do a festival while the war is still happening."" But, he adds: ""The reality showed us that cultural events are still possible in wartime."" Vlad says Atlas is expecting about 25,000 fans, crew and artists to be on site, while other events have only had a maximum of 10,000. With all those people in one place, a potential air attack is a huge concern. Vlad says the solution has been the brand new venue - a mixture of open-air and indoor spaces. There are two stages in the shopping centre's car park, and a further three inside the mall itself. ""It gives us a shelter which can fit more than 100,000 people,"" says Vlad. ""There will be more than enough space to get everyone evacuated quickly -- and we're talking minutes."" Vlad says it can be challenging to convince people - who are so used to hearing air-raid sirens - to head for a shelter when the alarm is raised. But he says there's a plan for that too - take the festival underground to a sixth performance area in the basement car park.  If the crowd does have to flee to safety Vlad says there's ""an entire stage"" and a bar so the music can continue. One thing that will be missing this year is the same number of international headliners.  Vlad says they were approached but most turned it down over safety concerns. He says he understands the decision, but ""seeing international musicians playing in Russia right now really ticks me off"".  ""That can be frustrating,"" he says. ""But if people honestly gave it a thought and decided that's not for them because they're scared for their life, that's fair."" It does mean that more homegrown acts will get a chance to take some of the top slots on the bill.  That includes Vitalii and Marina from indie band Disappeared Completely.  ""People need some joy in their lives, even through these hard times,"" says Vitalii.  Marina says: ""It's always nice to gather together with people and to celebrate life itself.  ""To just remember the joys of everyday life, because you might not have it tomorrow. ""Appreciate these moments and appreciate the people around you while you can."" They also say that after years of attacks from the air, they're no longer worried about performing outside. ""We got used to this. It sounds bad, because it's war, and we could die. But life is going on so we need to adapt,"" says Vitalii. While a festival might seem like a chance to forget about the war for a day, Ukraine's ongoing battle against Russia is reflected by Atlas United. The festival hopes to raise at least €2m (£1.7m), with most being spent on drones to help soldiers on the front line. And some Ukrainian acts who've been raising awareness abroad are due to return to perform in their home country. Solo artist Shmiska, who now lives in Paris, says it's important to come back for the festival. ""People sometimes just start to lose their hope. They start to lose their dreams,"" she says. ""I think, as artists, it's our job to give people this chance to feel again, to dream again."" Shmiska performs across Europe and says she worries people are starting to forget about Ukraine. So she's aiming to make her big show in Kyiv memorable, with light shows and plenty of costume changes.  ""It's such a big opportunity to feel alive again,"" she says.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clmy1nkm51jo,Chris Mason: My 40 minutes with Ukraine's Zelensky,The Ukrainian leader sat down with the BBC's political editor Chris Mason on Thursday.,19 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:35.081080,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"I get to interview a lot of politicians. And, full disclosure: I like politicians. It is my job to scrutinise them on your behalf and ask the questions you need answers to. But I think seeking public office is a noble thing to do. Many politicians could have a quieter, easier life – and in many cases a more lucrative one too – if they decided to do something else for a living. But functioning democracies require people willing to enter public life and take with it the brickbats that follow. Every so often, I have the privilege of meeting a political figure who stands out. Volodymyr Zelensky stands out, among the politicians I talk to at least, because he is a wartime leader. He is the personification of a nation under siege, in a deadly conflict that pits  - albeit indirectly – the values, instincts and interests of western democracies against Russia. The former television comic and actor, who finds himself not just as his country’s president, but president at a time of ultimate jeopardy for his people – and so finds himself one of the most recognisable faces on earth. What a privilege, then, for me to be invited to ask him some questions on your behalf during his visit to the UK. He is a man Moscow would like to see dead, so you won’t be surprised that the security that surrounds him is muscular. I had first seen first-hand his capacity as a communicator when he addressed Parliament in Westminster about 18 months ago. I was to see it again, one on one, in my conversation with him now. He speaks very good English, but in longer interviews (we spoke for around 40 minutes) he often answers in Ukrainian, particularly if he feels it important to be precise in his choice of language. So we spoke through interpreters, apart from the moments when he relished switching into English. I challenged him on the corruption that seems embedded if not endemic at senior levels of Ukrainian society. He said the fact we knew about it – and people had lost their jobs because of it – showed it was something Kyiv took seriously. He was sanguine about the prospect of getting to know yet another British prime minister – Sir Keir Starmer is his fourth in the two and a half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sanguine because, he said, the UK had remained steadfast and consistent in its support for him, despite the domestic political turbulence. A week ago Sir Keir – on his first overseas visit as prime minister – had been in the room at the Nato summit in Washington when US President Joe Biden had managed to muddle up President Zelensky with President Putin of all people, with the Ukrainian president standing just yards away. I was just down the corridor waiting for Sir Keir’s news conference, in which President Biden’s jaw-dropping gaffe dominated. The prime minister, just like Ukraine’s leader, sought to play it down as just one of those things. But President Zelensky’s take on Donald Trump’s outlook on Ukraine was more spiky – and in English. He also acknowledged that a return of all Ukrainian land was not necessarily a pre-condition for the fighting to end, as far as he saw it. “It doesn’t mean that all territories are won back by force,” he said. Let’s see what reaction those remarks provoke. For now the war rages on, tens of thousands of lives lost, millions of people displaced, billions of pounds spent. “The time to stand up for freedom and democracy is now and the place is Ukraine,” Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had told me earlier. A message for ears in Moscow, Washington and beyond as the war rages on – and Volodomyr Zelensky continues to make his case for your support to win it."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe25prezgzo,"Zelensky: Trump would be hard work, but we are hard workers",The Ukrainian leader tells the BBC in an exclusive interview that he is willing to work with anyone who is in power in the US.,19 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:35.165914,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says working with Donald Trump if he is re-elected as US president will be “hard work, but we are hard workers”. In an exclusive interview with the BBC in London, Mr Zelensky said he was willing to work with anyone who was in power in the US. Just days ago, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate in November's vote. The 39-year-old has in the past said “he doesn’t care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other”. The nomination has renewed fears that US commitment to Ukraine could fall away if Trump is returned to the White House in November's election. “Maybe he really doesn’t understand what goes on in Ukraine, so we have to work with the United States,” Mr Zelensky told the BBC. The Ukrainian leader is in the UK to attend a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), where he delivered a speech on Thursday afternoon. The EPC, which includes the 27 members of the European Union as well as 20 non-members like the UK, is a more informal forum for co-operation. Mr Zelensky earlier met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has vowed to stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” and has committed to spending £3bn on aid for the country. He said he hoped Mr Starmer's term in Downing Street would mark a ""special"" era in British foreign policy. “I don’t think Britain’s position would change,” Mr Zelensky told the BBC. “But I would like for Prime Minister Starmer to become special - speaking about international politics, about defending world security, about the war in Ukraine."" He added that Ukraine “doesn’t just need a new page, we need power to turn this leaf”. On Friday morning, President Zelensky will address a meeting of the UK cabinet in person - the first foreign leader to do so since US President Bill Clinton in 1997. He is expected to brief ministers about the situation in Ukraine and the need to ramp up Europe’s defence industrial base. The two leaders will also sign a £3.5bn defence export finance deal. Ukraine’s troops have faced a tough spring and earlier this week it was confirmed that they had withdrawn from the village of Krynky on the occupied eastern bank of the Dnipro river. In recent months, the Ukrainian army has had to try and hold back Russian troops along a very long front line in the east of the country. The city of Kharkiv and the surrounding areas have sustained continued attacks as Russian forces attempt to make gains in the region. Ukraine had hoped that its military efforts would be boosted by the arrival of F-16 planes promised by allies this summer.  But Mr Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had yet to see them. “It’s been 18 months and the planes have not reached us,” he said, saying that he was thankful for what Ukraine had been given. But he emphasised that new fighters were essential to help Ukrainians push back against Russia's aerial dominance and “unblock the skies”. With the war continuing for more than two years without an end in sight, questions have been raised as to whether there could be a negotiated solution. Last month, Switzerland hosted a Ukraine peace summit but Russia was not invited. Mr Zelensky has since said that Russia should attend a second peace summit penned for November. He told the BBC that the whole world will need to put pressure on Russia in order to persuade it to sit down and consider ending the war. “It doesn’t mean that all territories are won back by force. I think the power of diplomacy can help,” he said, adding that a weaker Russia on the battlefield would put Ukraine in a stronger position on the negotiating table. “By putting pressure on Russia, I think it is possible to agree to a diplomatic settlement.” Mr Zelensky has been Ukraine’s leader since 2019 and throughout Russia's full-scale invasion. While elections were due this year, Ukraine’s constitution rules out a ballot during the time of martial law. The president told the BBC that he did envisage a time when he would step down as president. “But not until the war is over,"" he said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw9ygvw959ro,World leaders show support as Biden quits race,"Many recognised that the decision to step down was ""personally difficult"" for the 81-year-old.",22 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:35.262994,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 Presidential race has sent ripples around the world, with a number of global leaders reacting to the news. He also endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris and said he would ""focus all my energies on my duties as President"" for the rest of his term. Many of his allies paid tribute to his foreign policy achievements and acknowledged the difficulty of his decision.  ""Thanks to [Biden], transatlantic cooperation is close, Nato is strong and the USA is a good and reliable partner for us. His decision not to run again deserves recognition,"" Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz posted on X.   The United Kingdom's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he ""respects"" Mr Biden's decision and ""looks forward"" to working together for the rest of his presidency. ""I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, President Biden will have made his decision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people,"" Mr Starmer added. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Mr Biden and US First Lady Jill Biden, calling the president a ""true friend"" to Canadians. ""He’s a great man, and everything he does is guided by his love for his country,"" Mr Trudeau said. Some noted the difficulty of Mr Biden's decision to step away from power.   Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Mr Biden had ""made difficult decisions"" throughout his political career that have ""kept the world safer, and democracy and freedom stronger"".  ""I know that you were guided by the same principles when announcing your latest decision. Perhaps the most difficult one in your life,"" he said. Mr Biden has faced intense pressure from recent weeks from fellow Democrats to step aside, after a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump in June. But even up until last week, Mr Biden has said that he planned to stay in the race. At  81, he is the oldest person ever to have occupied the Oval Office. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida noted that Biden's announcement is one the US president considers ""the best political decision he can make"". ""The Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of our country's diplomacy and security, so we will monitor the situation closely,"" Mr Kishida said. Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, described Mr Biden's decision to withdraw as ""responsible and personally difficult... but all the more valuable"".  But Mr Fiala also acknowledged growing political uncertainty in the US.  ""I am keeping my fingers crossed for the USA that a good president emerges from the democratic competition of two strong and equal candidates,"" he said. Italy's foreign minister and deputy PM Antonio Tajani said his country ""must look with great serenity to the US"". ""We will work well with whoever the next president is, whether Trump or Harris,"" he said. Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky said he respects Mr Biden's ""tough but strong decision"" and thanked him for his ""unwavering support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom."" ""We sincerely hope that America's continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or making its aggression pay off,"" Mr Zelensky said. Some countries at odds with the US have also reacted to Mr Biden's decision.  Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro called it ""the most sensible and correct decision"". ""[Mr Biden] realized that at that age and with weakened health he could not assume the reins of his country, let alone a presidential candidacy,"" Mr Maduro said at a campaign event for his own re-election. And the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's priority will still be on its war in Ukraine. ""A lot can change"" before the US presidential vote in November, he added. ""We need to be patient and carefully monitor what happens,"" he said. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5r235rr08o,Charli XCX and Beth Gibbons up for Mercury Prize,"The summer of ""Brat"" continues, with Charli XCX's brash LP among the 12 album of the year nominees.",25 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:35.361128,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The summer of ""Brat"" continues, with Charli XCX's brash new album named as one of the 12 nominees for the Mercury Prize. The Essex-born singer is shortlisted for her sixth record, which combines hedonistic club beats with introspective lyrics about her relationships and career. Also in the running are Irish country singer CMAT, breakout dance act Barry Can't Swim and BBC Sound of 2024 winners The Last Dinner Party. And Beth Gibbons is nominated for her debut solo album, Lives Outgrown, 29 years after winning the Mercury Prize with her band Portishead. The winner will be revealed in September - but for the first time in the award's 32-year history (except for 2020) there will be no public ceremony. Established in 1992, the prize recognises the best British or Irish album of the last 12 months. Returning nominees this year include Corinne Bailey Rae,  singer-songwriter Berwyn and the rapper Ghetts - each of whose albums examine issues of racism and inequality.  Eight of the 12 shortlisted artists are women or female-fronted bands - a record high.  They include Leeds-based indie band English Teacher, uplifting songsmith Cat Burns and jungle producer Nia Archives. The list is rounded out by Scottish musician Corto.Alto, whose album Bad With Names has received rave reviews for its supple, genre-splicing approach to jazz. Some high-profile albums failed to make the cut, including Blur's The Ballad Of Darren, Dua Lipa's Radical Optimism and Heaven Knows, by pop newcomer PinkPantheress. Last year, the Mercury Prize was won by a jazz act for the first time, with London group Ezra Collective taking the trophy for their second release, Where I'm Meant To Be. Other former winners include Pulp's Different Class, Elbow's Seldom Seen Kid and Skepta's Konichiwa. In recent years, the ceremony has been held at London's Hammersmith Apollo, with nominees each performing a track from their nominated record. But this week, organisers confirmed that element had been dropped in favour of ""other extensive promotional activity"", after the award lost a lucrative sponsorship deal with Freenow. The prize-giving will still be broadcast by the BBC, with the date still to be confirmed. That platform will prove essential for many of this year's artists.  Only two of the nominated albums have spent more than a week in the UK album charts, while some - including those by Corinne Bailey Rae and Berwyn - have missed the Top 75 altogether. Meanwhile, only one of the shortlisted records - The Last Dinner Party's Prelude To Ecstasy - has been popular enough to receive a silver disc, representing 60,000 copies sold in the UK. So if you've found yourself wondering what all these albums sound like, here's a potted guide to the class of 2024. Sometimes, music just floats out of the speakers and wraps you in a big, warm hug. That’s what Edinburgh-born Joshua Mannie, aka Barry Can’t Swim, achieves on his debt album, When Will We Land? A blissed-out house record, spiced with elements of Afrobeats and Brazilian pop, it’s a euphoric hymn to the unifying power of dance music. He says: “You only get to make your debut album once. So I want to showcase all the elements of the things I enjoy and love in music up to this point.” The critics say: “It's a record that makes every element work in its favour, however small – brewing them up into something quite magical.” [Clash Magazine] Berwyn made history in 2021 when an album of demo recordings became the first mixtape to become nominated for the Mercury Prize. Three years later, he’s back with his proper debut album - a visceral exploration of identity, immigration, race and resilience. Mixing dark-humoured poetry with soaring melodies, it roasts the UK’s immigration system, which treats the Trinidad-born, London-raised musician as an unwanted inconvenience. But amidst the struggle, he never loses hope, defiantly declaring that the pressure turned him “into a diamond”. He says: “These are all very raw experiences and very raw emotions - but I’ve been given a sense of purpose. That has been the best thing anyone has ever given to me.” The critics say: “An inspiring, educational album – it should be on the national curriculum.” [The Guardian] Thirty years after making her name with Portishead, Beth Gibbons’ first solo album is a quiet exploration of motherhood, ageing and loss. Relying entirely on hand-played instruments, it has a tactile, organic sound that perfectly compliments Gibbons’ weathered vocals. Now 59, she sings plaintively about absent friends and the physical reckonings of age: “I can change the way I feel/I can make my body heal.” Written and recorded over 10 years, it’s a worthy addition to the catalogue of great albums about middle age and later life, alongside Kate Bush’s Aerial, Lou Reed’s The Blue Mask and David Bowie’s Blackstar. She says: “When you’re young, you never know the endings. You think: We’re going to get beyond this [but] some endings are hard to digest.” The critics said: “Beth Gibbons gives us the understanding of our mortality that we all need.” [The Quietus] Three years ago, Cat Burns was busking on the streets of London when one of her older songs, Go, went viral on TikTok. An acerbic goodbye to a cheating partner, it eventually sold more than 1.2 million copies and earned her three Brit nominations. Her debut album came out just two weeks ago, catching fans up with everything she’s been through since. The titles are self-explanatory - Low Self Esteem, People Pleaser, Some Things Don’t Last Forever - reflecting the chatty openness of her lyrics. Blessed with a soulful voice and a left-field sensibility that stops songs from sliding into predictability, Burns proves she has more to offer than her break-out hit. She says: “I knew I wanted the album to be about being in your early 20s and everything that I’m experiencing - and then the songs just wrote themselves.” The critics said: “A talented singer with a distinct lyrical focus… striving to make herself a better human and the world a better place.” [Line Of Best Fit] It’s Brat Girl Summer. Even Kamala Harris says so. And what does that mean? On first glance, it’s all about hedonism - sweaty dancefloors, decadent parties, bad behaviour and “looking like an icon”. But scratch beneath the surface of Charli XCX’s sixth album and there’s a surprising vulnerability. Under the club beats and stomach-churning synth drops, she sings about social anxiety, body image and career insecurities. In some respects, it’s the most daring album yet from one of pop’s most uncompromising innovators. But it’s also become one of her biggest commercial successes, debuting in the top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic. As Rolling Stone put it: “The world has finally caught up to Charli XCX.” She says: “This new music is not going to be played in Starbucks. It’s not going to be played on the Zen Morning playlist. It’s pop music and I’m being true to myself.” The critics said: “Imperious and cool, nuanced and vulnerable, and one of the best pop albums of the year.” [Pitchfork] Irish singer CMAT’s second album is a concept record about travelling back in time to rescue herself from a relationship with an older man who “ruined her life”. The songs excavate the power imbalance. She consoles him about his “perfect” ex, does the dishes and pays the rent. He responds by cheating on her and destroying her self-worth. Drenched in the sounds of country-rock, CMAT tells these stories with dry humour rather than self-pity, turning a tragic story into a series of melodramatic show-stoppers. She says: “I wanted to make Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell for the girls.” The critics said: “A triumphant whirlwind of pain and self-preservation, which reveals more of itself with every listen.” [DIY] You might know her for the sweet soul song Put Your Records On, but a lot has changed for Corinne Bailey Rae since her breakthrough hit in 2006. Black Rainbows, her fourth album, was inspired by artefacts she saw at the Stony Island Arts Bank - a museum of black cultural history in Chicago. An ashtray in the shape of a black child prompted the song Erasure - a screeching punk anthem about the exploitation of enslaved children; while the freeform jazz runs of Peach Velvet Sky were based on the memoir of former slave Harriet Jacobs, who hid in a tiny crawl space for seven years to escape persecution in 19th Century America, with only glimpses of the sky to sustain her. Across the record, she branches out into electronica, jazz, Chicago house and Afrofuturism, as she explores “all the different ways of existing in the world as a black person”. She says:  “I’m starting to think of myself as an artist instead of someone who’s trying to get a pop song. I feel like I’m back in the playful mindset of music.” The critics said: “Bailey Rae sounds like an artist reborn. It may not be what you expect, but it’s all the better for that.” [Music OMH]  A prolific musician who once released 30 singles in 30 days, Corto.Alto is the alter-ego of Glaswegian jazz instrumentalist Liam Shortall. His debut album, Bad With Names, was released last year, showcasing his ability to edit improvised jam sessions into taut and compelling songs, full of skittering beats, squelchy synths and monstrous riffs. The record owes as much to the chopped-and-layered sounds of DJ Shadow and J Dilla as he does to traditional jazz - crossing boundaries and challenging perceptions without straying into dissonance or inaccesibility. He says: “This is my music - it is the closest representation of who I am - and it’s dedicated to my city, since it couldn’t have been made anywhere else.” The critics said: “Forward-thinking, cohesive, complete... Bad With Names marks a new high point for Scottish jazz music.” [The Skinny] “I want this album to feel like you’ve gone to space, and it turns out it’s almost identical to Doncaster,” said singer Lily Fontaine of her band’s debut release. The record is steeped in her upbringing in the North-West, addressing social deprivation and political mismanagement (“Can the river stop its banks from bursting? / Blame the council, not the rain”), alongside themes of identity, love, loss and celebrity. Musically playful, it combines Fontaine’s partially-spoken vocals with dreamy, Smiths-like guitar lines and complex polyrhythms - with the gorgeous The Best Tears Of Your Life building to a head-spinning wall of sound. They say: “When we were recording, it did feel at times like we were putting together pieces of random puzzles… but I’ve never been so proud of something.” The critics said: “Could be one of the finest debuts of the decade, with every band member shining in their ability and craftsmanship.” [Line Of Best Fit] Incredibly, the grime scene is now at a place where some of its originators are hitting their 40s. Among them is Ghetts, who jokes about becoming an elder statesman on this, his fourth album. “I used to worry about arrests, but not a cardiac,” he raps on the opening track, Intro. Elsewhere, his concerns are more serious. He talks about racial profiling, the NHS funding crisis, wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and even the ravages of postnatal depression on the powerful closing track, Jonah’s Safety. Showcasing his versatility, his flow graces beats drawn from neo-soul and Amapiano, in addition to more traditional drill tracks - but the real star is his perspective and wisdom. He says: “I always want the music to feel like a movie, to provide the listener with a unique understanding of my thought processes, or what’s going on in my life.” The critics said: “His storytelling has never been so raw."" [DIY] Bradford-born musician Nia Archives has been at the forefront of the UK’s jungle revival - combining saw-toothed breakbeats with heartfelt emotion. There’s a melancholy undertow to the lyrics which, in tandem with the title, suggest her frenetic live shows are only just managing to keep anxiety and exhaustion at bay. “Work is a chore, deep down I want fun,” she confesses on the otherwise breezy, Britpop-adjacent Cards On The Table. It’s a shot in the arm for the genre, dragging it away from the blokey pursuit of ever-more-punishing rhythms, towards a deeper, more spiritual sound. No wonder she’s won the support of jungle godfather Goldie, who pops up on the Cranberries-inspired banger Tell Me What It’s Like? She says: “Jungle is so chaotic and intense but my songwriting is always quite emotional. Bringing the two together always makes something quite interesting.” The critics said: “Catchy as hell and swaggers out of the speakers with an infectious joy.” [Louder Than War]  Opulent, gothic, melodramatic and crammed full of hooks, The Last Dinner Party’s album is an antidote to all the quiet, confessional ballads that have populated the charts for the last five years. Formed in London, but drawn from all over the UK and Australia, the five-piece draw equally from the fiery dynamics of Florence + The Machine, and the art-rock instincts of Sparks and Roxy Music. Fronted by human windmill Abigail Morris, and brought to life by killer guitarist Emily Roberts, the songs tackle everything from Catholic guilt to sex and death, with a penchant for unexpected tempo-switches and intriguing chord changes. Honed over months of live performance, there’s an visceral feel to the album’s 12 tracks, which were recorded (where else) in a church in North London last year. They say: “We wanted our debut album to be a mission statement.” The critics said: “Flamboyant, fun and totally distinct."" [NME]"

John Nickell-Lean, from Southwold, headed to the war-torn European country last month along with a team of ""ordinary people from Suffolk"". They completed the journey in a fleet of four former NHS ambulances, which could only be driven at 50mph (80kph), after raising almost £43,000. After travelling 1,200 miles (1,900km), Mr Nickell-Lean and his team handed over the medical equipment and vehicles in the centre of Lviv. ""It was a surreal moment and absolutely extraordinary really, and I think it is profoundly pleasing that we have done this,"" the 72-year-old said. ""All of us who took part are wholeheartedly behind what Ukraine are trying to do, to resist the Russian invasion, because if Russia is not stopped, it will not stop. ""The war Ukraine is fighting is a war on behalf of the West and what is at stake is incredibly serious."" Following the drop-off, Mr Nickell-Lean and his fellow volunteers were transported back to the border by UN accredited drivers in two blacked-out Mercedes. After a lengthy four-hour wait while their documents were processed, the team eventually returned to the safety of home soil. But despite the success of the trip, it was not without its nerve-jangling moments. ""There were quite long days and some of the hotels were simply awful, but one night we got back to the hotel and all of us crashed out. Then, at 2.30am, off goes the air raid warning,"" he said. ""I had to go round the hotel, get everybody up and then get them down to the air raid shelter. ""We sat there for the next three hours twiddling our thumbs and actually, there was a lot of leg-pulling. ""It would be very less amusing if this happened day, after day, after day - that must be incredibly wearing.""

Anglian Water’s £500m pipe will run through Lincoln, carrying 55 million litres (12 million gallons) of water a day. The utility company blamed the Covid-19 pandemic, ""unprecedented"" weather conditions and supply issues related to the war in Ukraine for the delay. The supplier said they would inform parish councils and affected landowners in August about when the work would resume. Ms De Vries, 59, lives in Greetwell, near Lincoln, where pipes are stacked in a field next to Wragby Road East. She said: ""I have not seen anyone there for around eight to nine months."" According to Ms De Vries, people living near to the site are left wondering why the work is delayed.  The pipeline – longer than the M1 motorway – would move water from the north of Anglian Water's patch, where it is more plentiful, to the south. In a statement, Anglian Water also cited labour shortages and rising inflation as reasons for the delay. However, the company was adamant the project would be completed, adding it would ""rephrase"" some of the planned work.  “We have communicated this with the parish councils and affected landowners and will release an updated timetable next month,” it said. In August last year, Anglian Water said it expected the pipeline - announced in 2019 - would be completed by the end of 2025.

Fergus MacInnes, Daisy Livesey and Emile Gonder are refurbishing a Mitsubishi Shogun, with the help of mechanic Craig Whitley. The friends will drive the vehicle to the front line in Ukraine where it will be used to bring injured soldiers to safety. They have also organised a fundraising rave to cover the costs of medical equipment. Fergus MacInnes, 18, was inspired to contribute to the work of Mission Ukraine after spending two months volunteering in the country earlier this year.  He said: ""I saw while I was out there just the number of casualties that came in and I heard countless stories of those who didn't make it in for lack of casevac vehicles."" ""There is a dire need for casevac vehicles."" He enlisted the help of student and DJ Daisy Livesey, 20. She has organised a rave on 19 July at Canvas Nightclub in St Peter Port to raise funds for the medical equipment to be installed in the vehicle. Ms Livesey said: ""War is awful, and I think doing something positive in these situations is really important, and facilitating an ambulance is fundamentally saving lives."" Student Emile Gonder, 20, is completing a 13 mile (21km) Spartan race challenge with his brother and sister and is looking for sponsorship towards their goal. ""It's a cause that we all deeply care about and I think it's just a really good opportunity to do something meaningful that we can be proud of,"" he said. They said they needed £6,000 to cover the total costs of the ambulance conversion, fuel and registration fees.  Mechanic and Canvas nightclub manager Craig Whitely helped the young people to find and buy the car second hand. He was refurbishing it for free and fundraising himself to help cover the costs of the car. ""Seeing the passion that these three have got, to try and do their bit to help out, I will try and support them in any way I can, because it is for a good cause,"" he said. Once refurbished the vehicle will also have bulletproof glass, armour around the engine and a stretcher to make it ready to function as an ambulance. Mission Ukraine is British-Ukrainian charity which has delivered more than 30 casevac vehicles to Ukraine so far. This vehicle would be used to rescue injured soldiers or civilians and take them out of the danger zone to safety quickly, when they would be transferred to more expensive medical vehicles. Mission Ukraine said it welcomed donations of more 4X4 vehicles which could be converted. The three friends hoped to drive the vehicle across Europe to Ukraine at the end of July.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06ke3p0pz8o,"Belarus sentences German medic to death, activists say","Rico Krieger, 30, was convicted of six crimes, including terrorism, in a closed trial in June.",20 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:45.129145,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A court in Belarus has sentenced a German medic to death after he was found guilty  of charges related to terrorism and mercenary activity, rights activists have said.  Rico Krieger, 30, was convicted of six crimes in a closed trial in June, Viasna, one of Belarus' top activist organisations, said in a statement. The group said he now faced execution by firing squad. What prompted the charges remains unclear, and the country's state news agency carried no further details about the allegations in its report. Belarus is the last country in Europe where the death penalty is still carried out. It says it reserves the sentence for serious crimes, including treason.  Viasna said that Mr Krieger's alleged crimes included mercenary work, espionage, terrorism, creating an extremist group, illegal operations with firearms and explosives.  It said it marked the first time someone had been tried in Belarus for mercenary activity.  The group, based in the Belarusian capital Minsk, said that Mr Krieger, who was working as a medic for the German Red Cross, had been in custody since November 2023.  Parts of the trial were carried out behind closed doors and Viasna added that it was unsure whether Mr Krieger has appealed against the verdict, or whether it has gone into effect.  His LinkedIn profile showed that he previously worked as a security officer at the US embassy in Berlin, before moving into healthcare working as a nurse and specialising in emergency medicine. Viasna suggested that the charges facing Mr Krieger could stem from his alleged involvement with the Kastuś Kalinoŭski Regiment, a group of Belarusian citizens who volunteered to fight Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The BBC cannot independently verify this.  The regiment is named after the Belarusian-Polish writer, journalist and lawyer, who was executed in 1864 for leading a revolt against Russia.  It is not immediately clear what connection Mr Krieger may have had to the group.  Opposition media in Belarus reported that he may have been linked to a unit within the regiment known as the ""Western"" battalion.  In a short statement the German foreign ministry confirmed that one of its citizens had been sentenced to death in Minsk, but it did not name Mr Krieger directly.  ""The Foreign Office and the embassy in Minsk are giving the person in question consular support and are working intensively with Belarusian authorities on his behalf,"" the ministry said, adding Germany considered the death penalty as ""a cruel and inhumane form of punishment"". ""We are working worldwide for its abolition"", the statement said.  In a post on X, Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, said she was ""concerned by news"".  Alexander Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994. He long sought to play the EU and Russia off against each other, while retaining power in Minsk.  But he has been forced to rely increasingly on Russian President Vladimir Putin since mass protests gripped the country after he claimed victory in the 2020 presidential election over Ms Tsikhanouskaya.  The West has refused to recognise his claim. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kr91zqp0lo,Germany plans to halve military aid for Ukraine,Berlin says a G7 scheme to raise $50bn from interest on frozen Russian assets will ensure other funding.,18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:45.236699,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Germany is planning to nearly halve military aid for Ukraine next year, from around €8bn (£6.7bn; $8.7bn) to around €4bn, according to a draft budget approved by the government.  Finance Minister Christian Lindner said Ukraine's financing was ""secure for the foreseeable future"" due to a G7 group of rich nations scheme to raise $50bn from interest on frozen Russian assets.  Germany is Ukraine's second biggest military donor, after the US. In 2024, Berlin's budget for Kyiv is set at nearly €7.5bn. The planned aid cut comes amid fears in Ukraine and among its European allies that US funds could be slashed or even stopped if Donald Trump wins the presidency in November's election. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The draft budget was approved by the German government on Wednesday. Although military aid to Ukraine is set to be reduced, the defence budget for 2025 will be raised by €1.3bn to €53.25bn.  This is still less than the €6bn for which Defence Minister Boris Pistorius had been pushing. Overall, Germany is planning to meet the target of 2% GDP spending on defence as required by the Nato alliance. The defence budget still needs to be approved by lawmakers. In other developments:  "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxqlz8l8plo,Starmer hopes to reset UK-European relations at summit,Sir Keir Starmer is preparing to host around 45 European leaders at a summit near Oxford on Thursday.,18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:45.331602,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Sir Keir Starmer will host around 45 European leaders on Thursday at a summit he hopes will begin to reset Britain’s relationship with the continent. The gathering of the European Political Community (EPC) will give leaders a chance to reaffirm support for Ukraine and discuss key shared concerns such as migration and energy. The summit at Blenheim Palace near Oxford will also allow the prime minister an early opportunity to meet scores of European allies only weeks into his premiership. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir promised the UK would have a “more active and greater convening role on the world stage”. He added: “The EPC will fire the starting gun on this government’s new approach to Europe, one that will not just benefit us now, but for generations to come, from dismantling the people-smuggling webs trafficking people across Europe, to standing up to Putin’s barbaric actions in Ukraine and destabilising activity across Europe.""  There will be greater European efforts to tackle people-smuggling gangs, and faster asylum decisions, with 100 Home Office staff redeployed to help return failed claimants to their country of origin. The EPC was set up in 2022 in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a way of bringing together European heads of government - from both the EU and outside - for informal talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend the gathering only a week after Nato leaders promised his country more air defences, but no invitation to join the military alliance. Lord Ricketts, former national security adviser, said the summit would help “put Britain back at the centre of European diplomacy” although most discussions would be about the war in Ukraine. “The main headline will be European leaders coming together to show united support for Ukraine and Zelensky at a time of political uncertainty in the United States,"" he said. The summit will also give the prime minister the chance to set out to EU leaders his hopes of agreeing a new security and defence pact with the bloc. He will be accompanied by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, minister for EU relations Nick Thomas-Symonds and Europe minister Stephen Doughty. But any EU-focused discussions will not involve the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, because the hearing and vote confirming her expected reappointment takes place in Strasbourg on the same day. Sir Keir is due to hold separate face-to-face meetings with the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and then French President Emmanuel Macron at a private dinner at Blenheim. Labour’s manifesto promised to make the UK “a leading nation in Europe once again, with an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners”. EU officials say they would be happy to discuss closer security cooperation, but say detailed negotiations are the future. They warn EU members may demand concessions from the UK in return on issues like fishing rights and youth mobility. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said the summit will allow Sir Keir to “hobnob and establish human connections” with European leaders he has never met. It will also give the PM a chance “to set out the direction and scope” of how he wants to reset UK-EU relations. “Keir Starmer’s personality in itself will do more than people realise,” Mr Grant said. “He is diligent, sensible, serious, he reads his briefs, he believes in the rule of law and international institutions. The Europeans will like that.” Also invited to the EPC – for the first time – are the general secretaries of Nato, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss what Downing Street calls the “arc of conflict and instability inside and near Europe’s borders”. The formal summit agenda involves separate discussions on tackling illegal migration and people trafficking, beefing up Europe’s energy security, and defending democracy and countering disinformation. The prime minister will attend the migration working group, co-chaired by Italy’s right wing leader, Georgia Meloni. In informal bilateral talks on the margins of the summit, leaders are also expected to discuss how best to prepare Europe for a possible Donald Trump presidency, with the risk of a global trade war and declining US military support for Ukraine. The prime minister said that “Europe is at the forefront of some of the greatest challenges of our time.""  “Russia’s barbaric war continues to reverberate across our continent, while vile smuggling gangs traffic innocent people on perilous journeys that too often end in tragedy,"" he said.  “We cannot be spectators in this chapter of history. We must do more and go further, not just for the courageous Ukrainians on the frontlines, or those being trafficked from country-to-country, but so our future generations look back with pride at what our continent achieved together.” He said that he promised to ""change the way the UK engages with our European partners, working collaboratively to drive forward progress on these generational challenges"", adding that work begins at the summit. This is only the fourth meeting of the EPC, the brainchild of President Macron. The previous biannual summits were held in the Czech Republic in 2022, and then Moldova and Spain last year. The next country to host the EPC later this year is Hungary whose leader, Viktor Orban, is close to Vladimir Putin and resists Nato support for Ukraine. There are questions about how much the diplomatic format can achieve. It has no secretariat, it takes no decisions, it agrees no communiques. Critics say it is little more than a talking shop. They also say the membership is so large that a shared agenda, let alone agreement, is hard to reach. But supporters say the informal discussions without framework give heads of government a rare chance to talk and work through problems. They also say it is one of the few bodies that brings together EU and non-EU countries. Blenheim Palace was chosen as a venue in part because of its symbolism as the birthplace of Winston Churchill, who in 1946 called for “a kind of United States of Europe…a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom”. However, the leaders will walk through grand corridors with paintings reminding them the Baroque mansion was named after a great battle of European powers in 1704 that saw Britain and Austria defeat French and Bavarian forces."

Dr Agnieszka Lewko said she wanted to help humanitarian efforts from ""the very moment"" Russia's invasion on Ukraine began  She hosted an online course in first aid for those on the ground within a month as well as paying a visit to Lviv to deliver two days of practical training. A group of 12 physiotherapists and rehabilitation leaders from Ukraine later visited Coventry University and took part in simulation training. A programme for physiotherapists working in intensive care units was also developed as part of the charitable foundation Patients of Ukraine’s War Trauma Rehabilitation in Ukraine Initiative.  While in Coventry, the group attended a conference on midwifery and nursing in partnership with University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire - as well as a clinical visit to the hospital. Dr Lewko said: ""The unexpected outbreak of the invasion on Ukraine created a feeling of disbelief and shock to see pictures of civilian casualties.  ""The last two years have showed that we are stronger together, leaders in education, clinical practice and research supporting our Ukrainian rehabilitation colleagues to improve patients’ care in this horrendous situation.  ""We learned a lot from each other through this journey and continue working together to improve patients' care and access to high quality rehabilitation globally."" One of the Ukrainian visitors said the course made them ""want to change for the better, move forward and benefit my country"". Another said: The trip has inspired me even more to improve my work because if we understand that we are not perfect, then we strive for self improvement and excellence in our craft."""

In a first for the Games, the spectacle will not be in a stadium, instead taking place on Paris' famous River Seine. Here is all you need to know about the ceremony...  When do the Olympics start? How City of Light changed the Olympics The eye-catching ceremony will take place across a 6km route along the Seine. It will begin at Austerlitz bridge and end among the gardens, fountains and palaces in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at Trocadero.   There will be almost 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes, plus a host of dignitaries, which sail past Paris' iconic landmarks, including Notre Dame cathedral and Pont Neuf. The boats will transport the athletes in the parade but also be used in the artistic part of the ceremony, which will showcase the history and culture of Paris and France. The identity of the performers, though, has been kept a tight secret.  Thousands of people are still expected to line the river and the streets with millions more watching on television around the world. ""Iâd like to show France in all its diversity,"" said Thomas Jolly, the French actor and theatre director named as the ceremony's artistic director - the role performed by Danny Boyle at London 2012. ""Illustrate the richness and plurality shaped by its history, which has been influenced and inspired by the diverse cultures that have passed through it, while itself serving as a source of inspiration."" The ceremony will also include the official opening of the Games, carried out by France president Emmanuel Macron, and the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. Again, many of the finer details have been kept as a surprise. Seating for spectators has been set up along the Seine for the ceremony The ceremony begins at 19:30 local time (18:30 BST) on Friday, 26 July. It is expected to last just under four hours, with the final stages taking place as the sun sets across the French capital.  Thankfully, the Paris weather forecast for Friday evening is good. Keeping with tradition, Greece will be the first nation introduced during the ceremony.  NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of their flagbearers for the Games. Greece will then be followed by the Refugee Olympic Team, while hosts France will be the last to be introduced.  Those athletes from Russia and Belarus competing as individuals because of their countries' role in the war in Ukraine will not take part. The opening ceremony will be shown live from 17:45 BST on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will be radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds from 19:00 BST. There will also be live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app bringing you the best of the event from Paris."

Michael Betoin, from Ecclesall, first took an aid van to Ukraine in 2022, and returned after realising his ""job wasn't done"". Mr Betoin has been living in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, taking aid south to remote villages near the front line of the conflict with Russia. The “exhausted” humanitarian aid worker said he would return to Ukraine to help prepare for the winter after a six-week break. Mr Betoin initially travelled to Kyiv, where he worked with war crimes investigators to clear bomb-damaged apartments. He admitted: ""I really just headed off blind, I didn’t know anything about the culture or the country."" He moved on to the city of Kharkiv, 20 miles from the Russian border, working with Ukrainian charity Turbota, which provides aid to people cut off by the war. He said: ""I thought I can do something,"" adding it felt like ""a calling to do it and make a difference"". He helps carry items including baby and medical supplies, personal hygiene goods and winter clothing. Having got ""stuck in and getting to know people"" he soon felt like he was supposed to be there. Mr Betoin said he had heard ""well over 500 explosions"" in Kharkiv and directly witnessed 10. He said: ""In Kharkiv it’s gone eerily quiet. For six months we got battered."" Mr Betoin said it became ""normal for us"" to hear the sound of shelling in the distance, with Ukrainians left with no choice but to ""get on with daily business as usual"". While Mr Betoin said he was ""mentally exhausted"", he was thinking about the “devastating events of no energy and heating” in the winter. He described those he was helping as “family”, and said walking away would feel like a ""betrayal"". But he insisted he would return to the region after a break. The volunteer, who was awarded two medals in the country for ""services to Ukraine"", said he wanted to mark the 500-day milestone by reminding people that the war was still raging. He said: ""We fly the flag for Britain, the United States and all the people of the free world and we send the message that we care and we always will.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglk87d817zo,"Crime, immigration and tax cuts - Trump's speech fact-checked",The former president's speech contained plenty of claims which BBC Verify has been checking.,19 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:52.814343,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump has addressed the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, accepting the nomination as the party’s presidential candidate. His speech - which lasted one and a half hours - contained plenty of claims about his record as president versus Joe Biden's.  BBC Verify has been checking some of them.  CLAIM: “Our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down"" VERDICT: Violent crime in the US fell last year. Mr Trump did not specify what kind of crime he was talking about.  Violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and there was a significant drop of 13% in the murder rate, according to preliminary FBI data.  These statistics aren’t a complete picture as some local police departments have not yet submitted their figures. The official FBI figures for last year will be released in October.  The latest FBI crime data, which is also preliminary, indicates this downward trend in violent crime in the US has continued into 2024, with reported incidents falling 15% in the first three months of this year, compared with the same period last year. Recorded murders dropped by more than 26% in the same time period, according to the figures.  CLAIM: ""We've had the worst inflation we've ever had under this person [Biden]""  VERDICT:  Under President Biden, inflation reached around 9% before falling to around 3%. That's nowhere near the worst in history - the record was 23.7% in 1920. Inflation rose significantly during the first two years of the Biden administration, hitting a peak of 9.1% in the year to June 2022. This was comparable with many other Western countries, which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues as a consequence of Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices.  But some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) spending plan in 2021 was a factor as well. Since then, US inflation has fallen steadily with the latest monthly figure at 3% as of June. Mr Trump also said “we had no inflation” under his administration. When Mr Biden came to office in January 2021, inflation was low -  at 1.4% - but prices were still rising.  CLAIM: “Our opponents inherited a world at peace""  VERDICT: There were dozens of conflicts globally in the last year Mr Trump was president, according to experts. Mr Trump followed this claim by saying the world was now a ""planet at war"" and he highlighted the current conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.  He’s right that they didn’t happen on his watch but he’s wrong to claim that he left “a world at peace” to President Biden. In 2020, the last full year Mr Trump was President, there were 56 active conflicts around the world, according to the Peace Research Institute in Oslo. It classed eight of these as wars, including ones in Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. CLAIM: ""If somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car or a hybrid they are going to be able to do it, and we’re going to make that change on day one""  VERDICT: The implication here is that Americans cannot buy these cars or will not be able to. There is no current ban on vehicles which run on gas (petrol) in the US and Mr Biden has not set out a plan to introduce one in the future. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new emission standards for cars built between 2027 and 2032. It estimates the car industry could meet these standards if 56% of new vehicles are electric by 2032. The Biden administration has said this is not a ban and new petrol-powered vehicles can still be sold beyond 2032. CLAIM: “The jobs that are created [under Biden] - 107% of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens” VERDICT: We can't find any evidence for this figure and the data shows millions of new jobs have gone to US-born workers.  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics produces figures for both US-born and foreign-born workers. But it does not have a separate category for illegal immigrants and Mr Trump did not say where he got his figure from.  Since President Biden took office in January 2021, the number of US-born workers has increased by 7.8 million. Over the same period, the number of foreign-born workers in the US rose by 5.5 million.  CLAIM: “The biggest tax cuts ever""  VERDICT: As President, Donald Trump did bring in big tax cuts but they weren’t the largest in history.  Mr Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 brought in sweeping cuts to taxation across the board. These are due to expire in 2025 unless the next administration extends them. According to analysis done by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s tax cuts were the eighth-largest since 1918 measured as a percentage of the size of the economy (GDP), and the fourth-largest in dollar terms since 1940 adjusted for inflation. Although, Mr Trump didn't introduce the largest tax cut overall he did pass the largest corporate tax cut in US history.  The 2017 law reduced this tax rate from 35% to 21%.  That was more than the cut passed under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, which lowered the rate from 46% to 34%. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

Lt Gen Vadim Shamarin was arrested amid a wider crackdown on corruption in the defence ministry and was accused of taking ""a particularly large bribe"" from a telecommunications company. Prior to his arrest he had served as deputy chief of the army’s general staff overseeing the signals corps and military communications.  Prosecutors have accused him of taking bribes between April 2016 and October 2023 to ensure an increase in orders from the company's factory.  A military court in Moscow will decide later on Thursday whether to extend his pre-trial detention until October.  His lawyer, Igor Dyukin, told the RIA Novosti outlet that authorities had seized his client's car - a Mercedes - and frozen his salary card.  Lt Gen Shamarin was arrested amid a wider crackdown on senior military officials. A host of senior defence ministry staff has been detained in recent months, including Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov and Lt Gen Yuri Kuznetsov, head of the defence ministry’s personnel directorate. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his long-term Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in May. He was replaced by Andrei Belousov, an economist with little military experience.  Experts have suggested that the crackdown marks an attempt by the Kremlin to boost efficiency in the Russian military and tackle corruption.  The anti-corruption drive has coincided with Russia making some incremental gains in eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting has focused on the Donbas region, where Moscow's troops are seeking to break through Ukraine's defensive lines.  Meanwhile, in Moscow, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters that efforts to force the country into peace talks would fail.  Ms Zakharova rejected what she called ultimatums based on any formula proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  President Putin has set out hardline demands for any potential peace talks, demanding that Kyiv recognise Russia's claim over four Ukrainian territories in the south and east of the country.  For his part, Mr Zelensky has repeatedly said he will not speak to Mr Putin or any Russian representative until Moscow's forces leave Ukrainian territory.  Addressing a gathering of European leaders at the UK's Blenheim Palace on Thursday, Mr Zelensky condemned attempts to strike deals with Russia behind Ukraine's back.  The comments come after Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Moscow where he met with Mr Putin. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czvxp9d5lrko,UK pledges £84m to stop illegal migration 'at source',The funding for Africa and the Middle East aims to address the factors driving people to flee their homes.,18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:52.998917,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged £84m for projects in Africa and the Middle East to stop illegal migration ""at source"". The government said the new funding for education, employment opportunities and humanitarian support would help address the factors driving people to leave their homes.  Speaking at the fourth summit of the European Political Community (EPC), which the UK hosted at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, Sir Keir agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron that there was ""no easy silver bullet"" to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.  But the PM said he wanted to focus on ""practical solutions"", not ""gimmicks"".  The EPC, which includes the 27 members of the European Union as well as 20 non-members like the UK, is a more informal forum for cooperation.  The summit has focused on the challenge of illegal migration, as well as support for Ukraine.  Speaking at a news conference, Sir Keir said he wanted to reset the UK's approach to illegal migration and deepen cooperation with Europe on defence and border security.  The PM said illegal migration needed to be tackled ""upstream"" and there was a ""consensus"" at the summit that the focus needed to be on taking down smuggling gangs. The UK has agreed new initiatives with Slovenia and Slovakia to tackle organised crime.  Meanwhile, the Foreign Office said £84m of funding would be rolled out over the next three years to address the factors driving people into small boats.  Projects set to get funding include programmes helping Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon to access education and jobs, as well as migrants in North and East Africa to fill local skills gaps, and humanitarian aid for displaced people in war-torn Sudan.  Stopping people crossing the Channel in small boats is one of the major challenges facing the new government.  Sir Keir has scrapped the Conservative plan to send some people who arrive in the UK illegally to Rwanda, describing it as an ""expensive gimmick"".  The plan was stalled by legal challenges and no migrants were sent to the east African country under the scheme before the general election. Instead the PM has promised to set up a new Border Security Command, bringing together Border Force officials, police and intelligence agencies, and to use counter-terror powers to combat people-smuggling gangs. Sir Keir accused the previous government of a ""dereliction of duty"" on migration and wasting time on the Rwanda scheme.  The PM said the new government would not be able to turn around the record number of small boat arrivals overnight, but he was pursuing a ""serious response"".  Sir Keir also sought to stress his ""profound respect"" for international law, reiterating that under his leadership the UK would not be leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, something which had been hinted at by the Conservatives.  Coming just two weeks after the election, the gathering provided an opportunity for Sir Keir to meet many of his European counterparts on the margins of the summit, including Italy's Georgia Meloni and Albania's Edi Rama.  A Downing Street spokeswoman said Sir Keir discussed ""innovative solutions"" to migration with the Albanian PM, including Italy's plan to send migrants to Albania for processing.  Asked if he could rule out the UK pursuing offshore processing, Sir Keir said this was not ""central"" to discussions at the summit as the focus was on ""taking the [smuggling] gangs down in the first place"".  However, he added: ""I'm a pragmatist and I've always said we'll look at what works. ""And where cases can be processed closer to origin, then that is something which of course ought to be looked at."" Sir Keir has said he wants to ""reset"" relations with the UK's European neighbours following Brexit.  While the government is not seeking to rejoin the EU, it wants to reach a security agreement with the bloc to help cooperation on intelligence and policing, as well as address some of the trading problems under the current Brexit agreement. French President Macron welcomed attempts to reset relations but warned the UK would not be able to ""cherry pick"" a new deal.  The EPC was born in the months following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the issue remained a key focus of the latest gathering.  Sir Keir pledged to stand with Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" and called on European leaders to do more to support the country.  Nato's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance had to be prepared for the Ukraine conflict to go on for a decade or more. ""The stronger our support for Ukraine and longer we are willing to commit, the sooner this work can end,"" he told the BBC.  The summit also took place against the backdrop of the US presidential campaign.  Republican candidate Donald Trump has expressed scepticism over the continued US funding for Ukraine's defence, while his running mate JD Vance has been a vocal critic of aid for the country.  Asked if he was worried about their positions, Sir Keir said it was for the American people to decide their president and ""we will work with whoever is elected"".  He added that the government was committed to the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US.  "

His 17-year-old daughter Elsemiek was on board flight MH17, 10 years ago to the day. Hans was the first family member to arrive in the small amphitheatre at the heart of the MH17 national monument. “How am I feeling?” Hans repeated my question. “A bit nervous.” He gestured to the rows of benches where 1,300 relatives and dignitaries from around the world, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander, would soon be seated. Two hundred and ninety eight people died on 17 July 2014 when the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was hit by a Russian surface-to-air Buk missile, fired from an area of eastern Ukraine seized by Russian proxy forces. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was among the guests filing past fields of sunflowers on his way to the heart of the monument. Mr Rutte, who is Nato’s next secretary general, was asked by the BBC if he and his government had done enough to get justice for the victims. “I don’t know. I really don’t know.” Two Russians and a Ukrainian national were convicted of murder in absentia by a Dutch court in 2022. Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Leonid Kharchenko all face life sentences but the three remain at large because Russia refused to surrender them to face justice. The Buk missile system belonged to Russia’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, based in Kursk, and the three men were all found guilty of transporting the missile into Ukraine. The Kremlin has always denied any responsibility for the air disaster, which has left an indelible mark on the collective memory of the Dutch nation. Mr Rutte noted the difficulties in pursuing justice and said he’d been moved by tributes paid in the run-up to Wednesday’s 10-year anniversary. A few relatives of those who died exchanged hugs and hushed words with the man who was prime minister at the time of the disaster and stepped down little more than two weeks ago. “I think he did everything he could,” said Silene Frederiksz, whose son Bryce was on board MH-17. “And I’m optimistic that Dick Schoof [the new Dutch prime mininister] will keep pushing for justice and accountability. He was involved in the MH17 investigation; he understands.”  A decade on, the families are still searching for the truth, and acknowledgement of responsibility. “MH17 keeps coming back to haunt me” said Piet Ploeg, whose nephew, brother and sister-in-law were all killed on 17 July 2014. Of the 298 victims, 196 were Dutch but there were victims from many other countries including 43 from Malaysia, 38 from Australia and 10 from the UK. Eighty children were among the dead. Australian relatives also took part in a separate memorial service at Parliament House in Canberra. The war in eastern Ukraine, at the time a few months’ old, erupted in February 2022 into a full-blown Russian invasion. Many of the Dutch relatives believe the current hostilities could have been averted if the international community had taken a tougher stance in response to the shooting down of flight MH17. The passenger jet exploded at 33,000ft (10,000m) and bodies and wreckage landed in fields of sunflowers near Hrabove in eastern Ukraine. Sunflowers have since become a symbol of the tragedy and relatives carried them past flags flying at half-mast at the Dutch monument not far from Schiphol Airport. Robbie Oehlers was one of the few relatives who travelled to the crash site in the aftermath of the disaster, in search of his niece, Daisy, and her boyfriend Bryce.  Every now and then planes rumbled above the sombre ceremony. Bryce's mother Silene was among those who read out some of the 298 names. Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, representing his country at the Dutch event, said those caught up in the tragedy of MH17 had shared a pursuit of justice, truth and accountability, but no words could ease the pain. Further legal action is under way at the European Court of Human Rights and the International Civil Aviation Organization Council to hold Russia accountable under international law for the attack. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was inevitable that everyone guilty of this and other war crimes would ""hear the verdicts they deserve"". “They will never admit it,” said Robbie Oehlers of Russia’s leaders. “Yes, I just want them to say sorry, but Putin, he never will. And now with the change in our government. Today they are thinking about MH17 again, but tomorrow they have other priorities.” For many of the families, the MH17 national monument has become a place of solace.  There are 298 trees planted at the monument in memory of every victim. At each tree relatives congregated to place flowers, candles and photos of their loved ones who never came home. “Love is the strongest emotion. Today reminds us, we are not alone in our sadness,” said Prime Minister Schoof. Piet Ploeg who spoke on behalf of the families,  said it was heartwarming to see everyone come together and thanked Mark Rutte for his efforts. The crowd applauded.  ""The most important thing,” said Mr Ploeg, “is that this dark day in our history isn’t forgotten."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce98qe70r61o,Three things to watch for in JD Vance's convention speech,The Ohio senator will introduce himself on the national stage after Donald Trump named him as his running mate.,17 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:53.182940,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Ohio Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump's newly minted running mate, will make his national debut on Wednesday as he delivers a prime-time address on the third day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.  At 39, the junior senator and former venture capitalist is the first millennial to join a major party ticket, a youthful contrast to the 78-year-old Trump and the 81-year-old incumbent president, Joe Biden. As Trump's running mate, Mr Vance is an early favourite for the party's 2028 Republican presidential nomination, but he remains politically unknown to most Americans and many in the party.  Donald Trump Jr, the former president's son and a close friend of Mr Vance, is expected to speak before Mr Vance's wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, introduces the Republican vice-presidential nominee.  As Mr Vance steps into the national spotlight, here are three things to look out for in his speech.  Mr Vance is expected to highlight his blue-collar background and his family roots in Appalachia as well as Middletown, Ohio, which inspired him to write his 2016 bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.  The book - which focuses on his impoverished upbringing with a drug-addicted mother in southern Ohio, enlisting as a US Marine and later attending Yale Law School - was published as Trump was elected to the White House. Later adapted into an Oscar-nominated film, it was upheld as a glimpse into understanding the white working-class voters that helped fuel Trump's rise.  Republicans are hoping Mr Vance's background will appeal to those voters, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three battleground states that were key to Trump's 2016 coalition and will be critical for a White House victory in November.  Mr Vance is also expected to highlight his military background. The former Marine, who was deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005, is the first veteran - and the first post-9/11 veteran - to be named to a major party ticket since John McCain in 2008.  Mr Vance's debut follows appearances by former Trump rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, who offered their full support for the former president on Tuesday after challenging his candidacy during the Republican primary.  Republicans have sought to close ranks around Trump while Democrats remain divided over whether to proceed with President Biden at the top of their ticket.  The Ohio senator is expected to strike a similar tone of unity, which Trump has said would be an underlying theme of the convention in the wake of an attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Authorities have yet to determine the motive of the attacker, who was killed at the scene.  In the hours after the shooting, Mr Vance laid blame on President Biden as the country was still learning about the events that unfolded.  ""Today is not just some isolated incident,"" Mr Vance wrote on the platform X, formerly Twitter.  ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.""  Former Republican Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a vocal critic of Trump who has endorsed Joe Biden, said Mr Vance's response ""should absolutely disqualify"" him from the vice-presidential nomination.  Mr Vance is expected to emphasise the message of national unity that his running mate has promised, but so far speakers at the convention have continued heated attacks on the Biden administration and Democrats.  Wednesday's convention theme, ""Make America Strong Once Again,"" is expected to focus on US foreign policy, highlighting the former president's ""America First"" isolationist policies that reshaped US relationships on the world stage.  Mr Vance has been sharply critical of the Biden administration's foreign policy on issues including the US withdrawal in Afghanistan, the Israel-Gaza war, southern border security and support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The nomination of Mr Vance has stoked fears in Europe over the implications of a second Trump presidency for both the Nato alliance and continued US military and financial aid for Ukraine.  The Ohio senator told the Munich Security Conference in February that European countries needed to shoulder a bigger burden so the US could pivot to East Asia against a rising China.  He played a key role in delaying the $60bn (£46bn) military aid package from Washington earlier this year and has suggested that Ukraine should broker a peace deal with Russia, even if that means giving up territory.  But the Republican party remains divided over support for Ukraine and it's unclear if Mr Vance's scepticism of Ukraine aid will influence Trump.  Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, traveled to Milwaukee on Tuesday to meet with Trump on continued aid. Following the meeting, he posted on X that he had ""no doubt that [Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy"". Concerns about a second Trump presidency rattled stock markets after Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek that Taiwan should have to pay for its own defense.  In response to a question on whether he would defend Taiwan against China, which sees the self-governing island as a breakaway province, the former president said: ""You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.""  He also said Taiwan, which is critical to the global chipmaking industry, ""took 100% of our chip industry"", sending semiconductor stocks tumbling on Wednesday. "

""It was one of the most horrifying experiences I've ever had in my life,"" she said. ""I woke up, looked at my mum because we shared a bedroom and was like, what was that? What are those sounds? And then it happened again. ""We pulled out our phones and started looking on social media and there was news all over that it started - explosions all over Ukraine. I just remember trying to pack up my stuff and my hands would not stop shaking."" Two years on, the 27-year-old sport climber is preparing to compete in the boulder and lead event at the Paris Olympics. That is something she could not imagine when she and her family joined millions who fled Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. ""Everyone was leaving. Everyone was trying to escape. It was just a horrible time where you don't really have food, you don't really have anything and you're not allowed to stop,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. Along with her sister and parents, Kazbekova drove for four days to reach Germany before having to wait for two days to cross the Polish border. ""You keep going - sometimes you're in this five-kilometre line to the border and you move five metres every few minutes. You cannot sleep. You cannot properly take care of yourself,"" she said. ""We arrived in Germany fully exhausted, and even though it was a really hard experience, we were still privileged enough to have the possibility to escape in the first place because so many people had to stay behind."" Climbing remained the one constant for Kazbekova, her primary ""coping mechanism"" during a time of upheaval and trauma. She has since moved to Salt Lake City in the United States while her family settled in Manchester. But with her grandparents still back in her hometown of Dnipro after they made the difficult decision to stay in Ukraine, Kazbekova said she felt ""lost"" getting on with her life while knowing what was happening in her home country. Her coach Malik - who himself fled war in his home country of Lebanon aged 18 - helped her to understand why it was still important to pursue her dreams. ""He knew exactly what I was going through without even me having to tell him anything and he was the person that walked me out of my darkness when I was just feeling really lost for months,"" Kazbekova said. ""I didn't see purpose in climbing. Why am I doing competitions when people back in my country are dying?  ""He was the person that made me realise how important it is that I do show up and if just maybe I manage to make a single person care a little bit more, donate a little bit more that's all I can ask for."" Kazbekova was the Ukrainian sport climbing champion from 2012 to 2021 For Kazbekova, climbing is not just a sport. It's a ""generational thing"". Her grandparents and parents all competed at international level in the sport and Kazbekova recalls her parents taking her with them to world cups and championships. ""Climbing is really like a part of my family,"" she said. ""It's the thing that kept me sane during the first months of the war. That was the only time I could put my phone down and concentrate on myself and stop updating the news and stop worrying and just do what I love."" Now, Kazbekova's sights are firmly set on this summer's Olympics in Paris, where sport climbing is appearing for just the second time.  Kazbekova will make her Olympic debut as she missed out on Tokyo three years ago after suffering with injury before testing positive for Covid, preventing her from competing at a qualifying event which provided the last opportunity to reach the Olympics. ""Being in Paris, being able to put my Ukrainian uniform on and show the world how resilient Ukrainians can be - that's the dream come true. That's the biggest motivation I have for now,"" she said. Kazbekova booked her place in Paris through the Olympic Qualifier Series in Shanghai and Budapest last month, where she finished sixth overall. ""How much it means right now for Ukraine to have representation out there in the world to keep reminding people that we still need help, we still need support,"" she said. ""We are still struggling so much and this fight, it matters."" All you need to know about Paris 2024 How City of Light changed the Olympics"

David Lammy told the BBC his ""similar background"" to the Ohio senator, chosen as the Republicans' pick for US vice president, made it easier for them to connect on policy issues. Mr Lammy said he had already found areas of agreement on foreign policy with Mr Vance, who opposed aiding Ukraine and has criticized Nato. His comments come as Mr Vance reaffirmed his isolationist ""America first"" stance, pledging to the Republican National Convention (RNC) to prevent unnecessary involvement in overseas wars. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Lammy said: “Let me just say on JD Vance that I’ve met him now on several occasions, we share a similar working-class backgrounds with addiction issues in our family. ""We’ve written books on that, we’ve talked about that, and we’re both Christians. So I think I can find common ground with JD Vance.” He claimed he had already found that ""common ground"" with Mr Vance, during discussions on US foreign policy during a meeting in Washington earlier this year. He was speaking from Blenheim Palace, for the fourth meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) where leaders are expected to reaffirm support for Ukraine and discuss key shared concerns such as migration and energy. Pushed on whether Mr Vance's views create a problem for the Ukrainian war effort, Mr Lammy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""there is a perspective of views in the Republican Party"". ""There are many committed to the trans-Atlantic relationship and many that understand that European security and security in the Pacific are inextricably linked,"" he added. ""There are many actors in relations to US foreign policy and I've been speaking to many of them including those who could become defence secretary and secretary of state."" The foreign secretary once called Mr Trump a “neo-Nazi sociopath” and “a tyrant in a toupee” but has since distanced themselves from those comments after he was appointed to Sir Keir Starmer's front bench. Asked whether his previous remarks might jeopardise a working relationship with a future Trump White House, Mr Lammy said: ""Donald Trump has the thickest of skins. ""You’re going to struggle to find any politician who has not had things to say about Donald Trump in his first term."" He pointed to Mr Vance’s own former criticisms of his new boss. Mr Vance once classed himself as a ""never Trump guy"" and calling the former president ""America's Hitler"". Mr Trump has ""just picked a vice-president who’s had some pretty choice language about him in the past"", Mr Lammy said. Earlier this week, senior Labour figures dismissed Mr Vance's joke that the UK under Labour might be the first ""truly Islamist"" country with nuclear weapons. Speaking at the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC last week, the 39-year-old said he was ""beating up"" on the UK, and had discussed with a friend “what is the first truly Islamist country to get a nuclear weapon"", then joked ""maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan kind of counts, and then we sort of decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labour just took over"". His comments were a direct criticism of Labour’s approach to immigration, and he also said that the Tories “have got to get a handle on this”. Right-wing US political figures have often linked immigration to a rise in Islamism in a country and have regularly focused on the UK. The remarks were embarrassing for Mr Lammy, who had labelled Mr Vance a ""friend"" during his recent efforts to build bridges with senior Republicans. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she does not ""recognise"" his characterisation of the UK, while Treasury Minister James Murray said he did not understand Mr Vance's point."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr7v5dl210o,Big events give PM chance to set tone for premiership,The prime minister is hosting a gathering of more than 40 European leaders in Oxfordshire.,18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:53.465744,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Another day, another set-piece moment for the new prime minister. Sir Keir Starmer will complete a hat-trick of made-for-the-cameras events in just a week, when he hosts a gathering of more than 40 European leaders in Oxfordshire today. Its just a day after the parliamentary pageantry of the King’s Speech and a week after the Nato summit and his visit to the White House in Washington. So what do those moments tell us about the new government - and the new PM? Back at Westminster, the new-look House of Commons (remember, more than half the new MPs are novices, just elected this month) will begin digesting the King’s Speech. It amounted to a hefty set of plans from a government with a large majority. It is a government in a hurry too, keen to capitalise on the momentum of their win less than a fortnight ago, by cracking on at home and abroad. Political parties all carry folk memories, collective reflections of past perceived mistakes and a desire to avoid repeating them. Some from the New Labour era in the late 1990s feel, with hindsight, Sir Tony Blair didn’t do as much as he could have done when his political powers were at their greatest. They are determined that mistake, as they see it, isn’t repeated. And so we saw the longest speech from the monarch at a State Opening of Parliament for 20 years and one of the longest since the Second World War. It’s worth reflecting that there is more to governing than legislating, and even powerful governments can get sidetracked. But the scale of Sir Keir Starmer’s win at the election means we should assume most of the ideas will actually happen. The era of small majorities, big rebellions and ideas going wobbly very quickly may well be over, for now at least. Sir Keir has the opportunity to begin to mould the country in his image, as he embraces a more interventionist, muscular state and a leftward political tilt – take the idea of the railways returning to public ownership, for instance. But to state the obvious and they know this – the hard work starts now for the government. The pageantry in Westminster was bookended by events on the international stage. Two of these three events – the trip to the Nato summit and the EPC – were in the diary anyway, for whoever was in government, but as a trio of commitments they amount to very useful stages from which a newbie government can try to establish itself. Today's summit is a meeting of the relatively new European Political Community, or EPC, taking place at the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, Blenheim Palace. It is an informal club of countries, some in the European Union and plenty, like the UK, which are not. Countries take it in turns to host its get togethers, and as luck would have it for Sir Keir, it is the UK’s go. The prime minister is talking up what he calls a “reset” with Europe, with border security at its heart. Ministers hope that the new government’s commitment to remaining within the European Convention on Human Rights, which some Conservatives flirted with abandoning, will open up the prospect of discussions with some countries such as Germany which didn’t happen before. Sir Keir faces domestic criticism from the Tories that he has abandoned their idea of sending some people arriving on small boats to Rwanda. He will argue that he is already redeploying more than 100 Home Office staff from the Rwanda scheme to what is being called a ""rapid returns unit"" to help secure the UK’s borders. Then there is the question of Ukraine, and European security – particularly in the context of the prospect of a second presidential term for Donald Trump in the United States. His pick for vice president were he to win, JD Vance, said days before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that he “doesn’t really care what happens” there “one way or the other.” It poses big questions for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, for Nato and for European security – all topics for today’s gathering. This week the PM has the chance to set the tone for his government on the domestic front - and on the international stage. “Change” is one of the most powerful words in politics and Labour very successfully harnessed it in the general election campaign. But it's one thing promising it. Another actually making it happen, however many set piece moments your opening fortnight in office serves up."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727zvgvv8ko,Trump's choice of running mate raises fears in Ukraine and EU,Diplomats and politicians voice concern over JD Vance's repeated criticism of US aid to Ukraine.,17 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:31:53.558209,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"European politicians and diplomats had already prepared for changes to their relationship with the US in the event of a second Donald Trump presidency. Now that the Republican candidate has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, those differences appear even more stark on prospects for the war in Ukraine, security and trade. A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, Mr Vance told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia.  ""The American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,"" he said. Nils Schmid, a senior MP in German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party, told the BBC that he was confident a Republican presidency would continue to stay within Nato, even if JD Vance came across as ""more isolationist"" and Donald Trump remained ""unpredictable"". However, he warned of a new round of ""trade wars"" with the US under a second Trump presidency. An EU diplomat said that after four years of Donald Trump no-one was naïve: ""We understand what it means if Trump comes back as a second-term president, regardless of his running mate."" Portraying the EU as a sailing boat preparing for a storm the diplomat, who preferred not to be named, added that whatever they might be able to tie down, it was always going to be rough. The US is Ukraine's biggest ally, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week: ""I'm not afraid about him becoming president, we will work together."" He also said that he believed most of the Republican party supported Ukraine and its people. Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump also have a common friend in Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister, who has consistently championed continued aid for Ukraine and recently met the former president at the Republican National Convention. Following the meeting, Mr Johnson posted on X that he had “no doubt that [Mr Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy”. But even if that sentiment is true, it might not apply to Mr Vance, who, days before the full-scale invasion, told a podcast he “doesn’t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other”. He also played a key role in delaying a $60bn military aid package from Washington. ""We need to try and convince him otherwise,"" says Yevhen Mahda, the Executive Director of the Institute of World Policy think tank in Kyiv. ""A fact we can use is that he fought in Iraq, therefore he should be invited to Ukraine so he can see with his own eyes what is happening and how American money is spent."" The question for Kyiv will be to what extent he can influence the decisions of his new boss. Yevhen Mahda agrees that Trump’s unpredictability could be a problem for Kyiv in the run-up to the US presidential election. The biggest supporter of the Trump-Vance ticket in the European Union is Hungary’s Viktor Orban who returned recently from a visit to see the Republican candidate, after visiting Mr Zelensky and President Putin, with whom he maintains close ties. In a letter to EU leaders, Mr Orban said a victorious Donald Trump would not even wait to be inaugurated as president before quickly demanding peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. ""He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,"" the letter states. Mr Zelensky has himself said this week that Russia should attend a peace summit possibly next November, and he has promised a “fully ready plan”. But he made clear he had not come under Western pressure to do so. Viktor Orban's recent ""peace missions"" to Moscow and Beijing have sparked accusations that he’s abusing his country’s six-month rotating presidency of the European Council. European Commission officials have been told not to attend meetings in Hungary because of Mr Orban’s actions. During the Trump presidency, the US imposed tariffs on EU-produced steel and aluminium. Although they were paused under Joe Biden’s administration, Trump has since floated a 10% tariff on all overseas imports should he get back into the White House. The prospect of renewed economic confrontation with the US will be seen as a bad, even a disastrous, outcome in most European capitals. ""The only thing we know for sure is there will be punitive tariffs levelled on the European Union so we have to prepare for another round of trade wars,"" said Nils Schmid, the Social Democrats’ foreign policy lead in the Bundestag. JD Vance singled out Berlin for criticism of its military preparedness earlier this year. While he didn’t mean to ""beat up"" on Germany, he said the industrial base underpinning its arms production was  insufficient. This will all pile further pressure on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, to ""step up"" as a principal player in underwriting European security. After his much-lauded ""zeitenwende"" (turning point) speech in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Olaf Scholz was often accused of hesitancy on supplying weapons to Kyiv. But his allies are always keen to point out that Germany is second only to the US in terms of military aid to Kyiv while it has – for the first time since the end of the Cold War – met the 2% GDP defence spending target, albeit via short-term budgeting. ""I think we are on the right track,"" said Mr Schmid. ""We have to build back an army that was neglected for 15 to 20 years."" But observers are far from convinced that behind-the-scenes European preparations are either serious or sufficient. There are few leaders with the political clout or inclination to champion the future security architecture of an unwieldy European continent. Chancellor Scholz has an understated style and clear resistance to taking a lead on bolder foreign policy positions – and faces a very real prospect of being voted out of office next year. French President Emmanuel Macron has been left a severely weakened figure after calling parliamentary elections that have left his country in a state of political paralysis. Polish President Andrzej Duda warned on Tuesday that if Ukraine loses its struggle against Russia “then Russia’s potential war with the West will be extremely imminent”. ""This voracious Russian monster will want to attack on and on."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134vmk074lo,US citizen sentenced to 13 years in Russian prison,Mr Leake is one of about a dozen Americans currently held in Russian detention.,18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.495579,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"US citizen Michael Travis Leake has been sentenced to 13 years in a Russian prison for ""attempted drug smuggling"", Moscow's court service said. According to the prosecutor's office, Mr Leake, a former paratrooper and musician, tried to sell drugs he had obtained from an accomplice between January and June 2023.  It was not clear how Mr Leake, who is one of about a dozen Americans currently held in Russian detention, pleaded.  Washington has urged its citizens to leave Russia immediately, citing the threat of arrest amid the highest tensions between the two countries since the Cold War. Mr Leake was accused of packaging the drugs for sale before giving them to another defendant in the case, a Russian woman named Veronika Grabanchuk.  Citing the investigation, Russian news agency Interfax reported that both Mr Leake and Ms Grabanchuk made four attempts to sell over 40g of mephedrone.  ""In addition, Leake stored more than 1.6g of mephedrone and 0.54g of pills containing the narcotic drug MDMA at his apartment on Zaporozhskaya Street without the intention of selling them. The drugs were found and seized during operational activities,"" the report added. In June, Russian state television broadcast footage from Mr Leake's trial that showed him locked in a metal cage. In a separate video shared online, he said he ""didn't know"" why he was detained. Appearing confused, he said he did not believe he had done what he was accused of, because he did not know what the charges were. In Russia, only 0.25% of all cases referred to court in 2018 ended with not-guilty verdicts. By comparison, the rate from 2017 to 2018 in UK magistrates' courts was approximately 15%, rising to 20% at Crown Court level. Mr Leake is at least the third American detained in Russia in recent years amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow. A musician and music producer in his early 50's, Mr Leake was a member of Lovi Noch, meaning catch the night, an ""American fronted rock band"" based in Moscow.  He is reported to have lived in Russia for many years.  US media outlet CNN reported that he appeared on the travel show Parts Unknown - hosted by the late chef Anthony Bourdain - for an episode in 2014 that was filmed in Moscow and St Petersburg. Darya Tarasova, who produced the episode, told CNN that Mr Leake was a ""showman"" who was ""very articulate"" and who ""loved Russia"". He often worked with local rock bands, Ms Tarasova said. Russian local media had earlier reported his arrest at his flat in Moscow. US officials have previously accused Russia of deliberately targeting American citizens for arrest. In March, Russian authorities arrested US journalist Evan Gershkovich, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, on espionage charges. He remains in pre-trial detention. Mr Gershkovich's trial started in June and closing arguments are scheduled for Friday.  Late last year, American basketball player Brittney Griner, who was jailed in Russia on drugs charges, was released in a prisoner swap for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. US marine Paul Whelan is serving a 16-year prison sentence on ""spying"" charges - he was sentenced before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has weakened relations between US and Russia."

""Most people prefer to be in a safe country. For us, England is now home,"" said Liudmyla Hrebeniuk. Mrs Hrebeniuk and her daughter Alina Liudchko came to the UK after meeting host Kev Draper as he delivered aid at a refugee camp on the Ukrainian-Polish border.

When informed there would be more money available from council to help hosts  with the cost of living, Mr Draper said he welcomed it. ""But we don't do this for the financial benefits, we don't calculate it,"" he said. ""You need to do this because you want to it,"" agreed Mrs Draper. ""If you're doing it because you think the finance will help you, it won't work.""  To help off-set the costs of rising energy and food bills, councils are increasing the amount they pay hosts. Among them is South Gloucestershire Council. It said it is now paying £500 pounds per month to ease the cost - an increase from £350.   The authority is also renewing an appeal for new hosts as 60 new refugees are expected to arrive in the area in the next few months. Cabinet member for Cost of Living, Equalities and Public Health, Councillor Alison Evans, said the hosts already helping people displaced by the war in Ukraine had been 'fantastic.' ""They've opened up their hearts as well as their homes to our Ukrainian guests, so if you have a spare room and time to help Ukrainians and really want to help, please contact us. ""What we provide is also a wrap-around service to provide support - financial, medical, housing and language support.""  Other authorities have also outlined what they are doing to help those taking part in the scheme. Bristol City Council, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES), Wiltshire County Council, Swindon Borough Council and Somerset Council are all boosting the payments to £500 a month when guests have been living in the UK beyond six months. Gloucestershire County Council, however, is providing £600 a month, regardless of how long the guests are with a host family. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgl9dgjgkxo,Trump VP pick Vance vows to fight for 'forgotten' Americans,The young vice-presidential pick channelled his working-class roots as he assailed “career politicians” like President Biden.,18 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.675815,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump’s vice-presidential pick JD Vance vowed in a primetime speech to fight for working-class Americans that he argued had been “cast aside and forgotten” by the Democrats. Introducing himself to millions of Americans watching on TV at home, the Ohio senator channelled his humble roots in the Midwest as he assailed “career politicians” like President Joe Biden. He argued in his address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that Trump was the ""last best hope” for Americans. Trump and his running mate will challenge the Democratic White House ticket, currently Mr Biden and his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, in November’s election. Mr Biden’s account on X, formerly Twitter, hit back at Mr Vance on Wednesday night, over his positions on abortion and Ukraine. Mr Vance, 39, is hoping to become one of the youngest vice-presidents in US history. In the speech, he charted his journey from a difficult childhood in small-town Ohio to the US Marines, Yale Law School, and finally the US Senate. The author of best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his impoverished family in Appalachian coal country, said “America’s ruling class” had destroyed communities like his hometown with trade agreements and foreign wars. “From Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the Great Recession, from open borders to stagnating wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again,” he said. He continued: “Donald Trump represents America’s last best hope to restore what – if lost – may never be found again. “A country where a working-class boy, born far from the halls of power, can stand on this stage.” The running mate, who is married to Usha Vance, a lawyer and daughter of Indian immigrants, said the US had traditionally welcomed newcomers, but that it ought not to import foreign labour. “When we allow newcomers, we allow them on our terms,” he said. Mr Vance was previously an opponent of Trump, once dismissing the Republican as an “idiot” who could become “America’s Hitler”. By then a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, he later mended fences with Trump. He won the former president's endorsement and was elected to the Senate in 2022, taking office the following year. Democrats have seized on some of Mr Vance’s past statements, including that he doesn’t “really care what happens to Ukraine” and support for a nationwide abortion ban. He has recently moderated his stance on abortion to align with the official Republican platform, which says the issue should be decided by individual states. He did not mention the war in Ukraine during his speech, or say much at all about foreign policy, which was the theme of the third day of the party conference. Mr Vance did say that US allies must share in the burden of securing world peace and America would avoid conflict but “punch hard” if provoked under a second Trump presidency. He began his speech by talking about last Saturday's assassination attempt on Trump. ""They accused him of being a tyrant,"" he said. ""They said he must be stopped at all costs. But how did he respond? He called for national unity, for national calm.” In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mr Vance blamed it on Mr Biden’s rhetoric and his warnings that his Republican rival poses a threat to democracy. Most Americans had little knowledge of him until Wednesday night. A CNN poll conducted last month showed that 13% of registered voters said they had a favourable opinion of Mr Vance and 20% an unfavourable one – nearly two-thirds either had never heard of him or had no opinion. Some convention-goers on Wednesday said they were still learning about his biography. Cindy Dore and Jackie Canon, two Republican delegates from Louisiana, said they were excited by Trump’s pick. “He’s young, vibrant,” Ms Dore said. She said she appreciated Hillbilly Elegy, but other than that, she didn’t know a lot about Mr Vance. The speeches began shortly after it was announced that President Biden had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and temporarily suspended campaign activities. The climax of the Republican convention will be Donald Trump’s speech on Thursday night. Chris Devine - an associate professor of politics at the University of Dayton and co-author of Do Running Mates Matter? - told the BBC that vice-presidential picks tend to have quite a small effect on the overall race. “If it’s the case that people look at JD Vance and see him as insufficiently experienced, they will think less of Donald Trump and his judgement,” he says. ""Not by a lot, but potentially on the margins."" But Mr Devine also noted that Mr Vance is an “incredibly talented communicator” despite being a relative political newcomer.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgmxw7g0veo,Government launches 'root and branch' defence review,"The review will look at the threats the UK faces in a ""more volatile world"", the government says.",16 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.753969,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Defence Secretary John Healey hailed the government's defence review as the ""first of its kind"" and said it will ""take a fresh look at the challenges we face"". Mr Healey noted the ""increasing instability and uncertainty"" around the world, including the conflict in the Middle East and war in Ukraine, and said ""threats are growing"". The strategic defence review will consider the current state of the armed forces, the threats the UK faces and the capabilities needed to address them. Sir Keir Starmer has previously said the review will set out a “roadmap” to the goal of spending 2.5% of national income on defence – a target he has made a “cast iron” commitment to but is yet to put a timeline on. On Monday, the prime minister said the “root and branch review” of the armed forces would help prepare the UK for “a more dangerous and volatile world”. The review will invite submissions from the military, veterans, MPs, the defence industry, the public, academics and the UK's allies until the end of September and aims to deliver its findings in the first half of 2025. “I promised the British people I would deliver the change needed to take our country forward, and I promised action not words,"" Sir Keir said. ""That’s why one of my first acts since taking office is to launch our strategic defence review. ""We will make sure our hollowed out armed forces are bolstered and respected, that defence spending is responsibly increased, and that our country has the capabilities needed to ensure the UK’s resilience for the long term.” The review will be overseen by Defence Secretary John Healey and headed by former Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson along with former US presidential advisor Fiona Hill and former Joint Force Commander Gen Sir Richard Barrons.  The group will have their work cut out. The global security threats facing the UK and its Western allies are more serious and more complex than at any time since the end of the Cold War in 1990. They also coincide with what many commentators have said is a catastrophic running down of the UK’s armed forces to the point where the country is arguably no longer considered to be a Tier One military force. In terms of the number of troops in its regular forces, the British Army is now at its smallest size since the time of the Napoleonic Wars two centuries ago.  Recruitment is failing to match retention, with many soldiers and officers complaining about neglected and substandard accommodation. The Royal Navy, which has spent vast sums on its two centrepiece aircraft carriers, is in need of many more surface ships to fulfil its tasks around the globe. Its ageing fleet of nuclear-armed Vanguard submarines, the cornerstone of the UK’s strategic defence and known as the Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), is overdue for replacement by four Dreadnought class submarines and costs are mounting. Commenting on the review, Mr Healey said: “Hollowed-out armed forces, procurement waste and neglected morale cannot continue.”  The defence and security threats facing the UK, Nato and its allies further afield are multiple. They include a war raging on Europe’s eastern flank in Ukraine against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The UK, along with the EU and Nato, has opted to help defend Ukraine with multi-billion pound packages of weapons and aid, stopping short of committing combat troops. The policy behind this is not entirely altruistic. European governments, especially those closest to Russia like Poland and the Baltic states, fear that if President Putin wins the war in Ukraine it will not be long before he rebuilds his army and invades them next. Some of those countries are already busy beefing up their own defence spending closer to 3% or even 4% of GDP. The challenge for Nato has been how to provide Ukraine with as much weaponry as it can, without provoking Russia into retaliating against a Nato state and risk triggering a third world war. The Royal Navy has been in action recently in the Red Sea, where it has been operating alongside the US Navy in fending off attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. But the UK has also made naval commitments further afield in the South China Sea with the Aukus pact, comprising of Australia, UK and the US, aimed at containing Chinese expansion in the region. Critics have questioned whether a financially-constrained UK can afford to make commitments like this on the other side of the world. Closer to home in Europe, there is a growing threat from so-called “hybrid warfare” attacks, suspected of coming from Russia. These are anonymous, unattributable attacks on undersea pipelines and telecoms cables on which Western nations depend. As tensions increase with Moscow there are fears such actions will only increase and the UK cannot possibly hope to guard all of its coastline all of the time. But while those nervous Nato partners living close to Russia’s borders are busy beefing up their defence spending closer to 3 or even 4% of GDP, the UK has so far declined to put a timetable on when it will raise its own defence spending to just 2.5%. Opposition figures have criticised the government for refusing to say when defence spending will be increased. Before his election defeat, former prime minister Rishi Sunak committed to reaching 2.5% by 2030. Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge previously said: ""In a world that is more volatile and dangerous than at any time since the Cold War, Keir Starmer’s Labour government had a clear choice to match the Conservatives’ fully funded pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030. ""By failing to do so, they’ve created huge uncertainty for our armed forces, at the worst possible time.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeer7lj5l0o,NI photographer caught in Russian ambush in Ukraine,A Belfast man found himself in the middle of a Russian ambush while reporting on Ukrainian troops.,15 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:00.840078,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Belfast conflict photographer has spoken of his experience in a Russian ambush whilst reporting on the war in Ukraine.  Conall Kearney had been commissioned by Ukrainian government funded United24 to join a unit on what was intended to be a simple reconnaissance mission along the frontline.  The attack in May this year lasted 14 hours with Mr Kearney sustaining numerous injuries.  Speaking to BBC News NI, he said he is ""lucky to be alive"". Mr Kearney said he had always been interested in how the story of war and conflict is documented. His job has seen him travel the world but his first forays into conflict photography were a lot closer to home, documenting ""various riots and parades"" in Belfast. He later moved to Berlin and began to cover various protests and riots. The photographer also reported on the Hong Kong 'Umbrella Revolution', as well as the 2022 Lebanon Election.  ""It is like an addiction. You chase this buzz,"" Mr Kearney said.  ""You've still got this genuine interest in the topic, but there is a thrill, especially when a situation is completely crazy and you come out unscathed with great photos. ""It's definitely something you chase too much at times."" Mr Kearney first visited Ukraine in 2018 and said he ""instantly fell in love with the country"".  When war broke out five years later, he described it as a ""no brainer"" that he had to go.  ""It was a direct train from Berlin to the Ukrainian border; within a week I was on the Russian border."" Mr Kearney was one of last journalists in Bakhmut, a Ukrainian city captured by Russian forces in February 2023.  He saw both the peak of the battle and the Russian military entering the city. He also witnessed the Russian advance in the Avdiivka region, as well as the siege of Kharkiv.  In May, Mr Kearney and a colleague joined the Kayfariki unit, a Ukrainian military group made up of left-wing FC Arsenal Kyiv fans. For safety reasons, he withheld specific details of the location, though confirmed it occurred in the Donbas region.  Unbeknownst to the Ukrainian forces, Russia had identified the unit's location and had planned an attack.  It was not until the early hours of the final day that this plan was put into action. Mr Kearney said his unit was bombarded for three hours.  ""Once this ended, a convoy of tanks drove into our town. All hell broke loose."" This initiated 14 hours of back and forth gunfire, artillery and drones.  Mr Kearney estimated there were roughly 70 Russian soldiers, compared to the eight Ukrainian fighters. He recalled that the Russians were so close he could hear them strategising. Asking the commander what the plan should be, he was met with the response: ""Dying is not part of the plan. We’re going to escape, but it’s probably not going to work.""  Outnumbered, injured, and quickly running out of ammunition, their situation was untenable.  ""I accepted I was dead,"" said Mr Kearney.  When he asked how one of the injured soldiers felt, the only reply was: ""I don’t feel anything, we’re already dead. ""Everybody was injured,"" said the photographer. ""We could hear the Russians screaming for our blood.  ""There was a point where the commander was like 'this is probably it'. When you hear something like that, I think back over my life and think 'I had a good run'."" ""Once night came we just sprinted out the back,"" said Mr Kearney.  He described how the unit ran three kilometres, facing Russian gunfire the entire time.  ""How they didn’t hit any of us is beyond a miracle."" Eventually, the group escaped beyond the reach of the Russian guns and were rescued by Ukrainian troops.   They survived with zero casualties.  ""I’m definitely one of the lucky ones,"" the photographer explained.  The Belfast man has already been back to Ukraine to catch up with the unit, which is now back on the frontline.   ""I met them all. They were in pretty good spirits,"" he said. During the ambush, Mr Kearney heard his comrades constantly repeating a phrase he could not understand.  ""When it finally got translated, I found out it was that the guys saying 'I love you' to each other."" "

The paper says a new bill in the speech will curb residents' rights to object to controversial building schemes. Sources also tell the paper that areas of green belt land considered ""low quality"" will be classified as grey belt and released for development.  According to the Times, the bill will mean councils will have to identify land for their housing needs, and there will be a ""presumption"" in favour of development. Locals will be able to agree the style of housing, but not block plans. Councils that fail to outline their housebuilding plans quickly could see ministers stepping in to impose blueprints for building more homes soon. The Guardian reports that senior civil servants warned former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a week before he called the election that he needed to take urgent action on the prison overcrowding crisis or risk breaching his legal responsibilities. The paper notes that senior civil servants felt the crisis was so severe that their boss, Simon Case, chaired emergency Cobra meetings on the issue. The Daily Telegraph has a photo of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson after their meeting at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The paper reports that the former prime minister used the meeting to urge Mr Trump not to abandon Ukraine if he's re-elected, in the wake of his decision to pick JD Vance, who strongly opposes American support for the war, as his running mate. Gareth Southgate's decision to call it a day as England manager - and the issue of who will replace him - features in many of the papers. The Daily Mirror calls him a ""man of honour"", and says he's bowing out with his reputation intact... but without the trophy the nation craves.  ""Thank you Gareth... for everything"" is the Sun's front page headline, echoing Southgate's farewell sign-off. Though it notes on its back page that ""nervous"" Newcastle have issued a ""hands-off"" warning to England over their manager Eddie Howe, who's being seen as a leading contender to replace Southgate.  The Daily Express thanks Southgate for ""taking us to the edge of glory"". It too says the Football Association face a fight if it wants to prise Eddie Howe away from Newcastle to become the new England boss.  The Daily Mail suggests Southgate's departure has sparked a frantic global scramble to replace him. It says the Argentinian Mauricio Pochettino, and the German Thomas Tuchel are both potential candidates. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."

James Kaye, who took on the title of Seigneur du Fief ès Poingdestre last year, had flown 5,000 miles (8,050km) from Colorado in the US to be part of the modernised tradition. It was an update to an 800-year-old custom of giving two dead ducks on a silver platter to a new monarch on their first visit to the island. Mr Kaye, a logistics manager for Lockheed Martin, said he would ""personally have preferred the ducks"", but  agreed the eggs were more appropriate ""in today's society"" and said the logistics ""make it a little bit easier for everyone"". The island has six seigneurs - previously feudal lords but now purely ceremonial titles - and the tradition dates back to Norman times. Mr Kaye bought the title last year when it was sold to raise funds to provide humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Mr Kaye said he made the journey for the royal visit because ""when you get an invitation from their majesties, well, you just do it; you sit in the rain, you do what your service determines you to do, because that is what we expect of their majesties"". He said he saw the value of ""the monarchy and what it is today"".  ""It's something that everyone can rally around as you've seen today. That's not political, that inspires people; that is service-bound and I think that that has inspired me to service bound to Jersey,"" he said. Mr Kaye, who had served in the 101st Airborne Division, said he was also excited to be close to the site of World War Two's Normandy landings. Mr Kaye has also teamed up with a fellow American who is a seigneur in Guernsey,  John Deichler, to set up a scholarship to ""provide Americans and Channel Islanders opportunities on both sides of the pond"".

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g4pjj2gwo,What are the big security threats coming down the track?,"Our BBC Security Correspondent, Frank Gardner, looks at the next foreign policy challenges for Starmer's government.",14 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:01.082759,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"On the face of it, this past week’s Nato summit in Washington has ticked the boxes. The alliance can show it is bigger and stronger than ever, its military support for Ukraine appears undiminished and it has just sent a robust message to China to stop secretly supporting Russia’s war on Kyiv. Sir Keir Starmer’s new government has had a chance to position itself as a linchpin in the transatlantic alliance at a time when political uncertainty hovers over the White House and much of Europe. Back home in Britain, the priorities for this new government are pressing: the economy, housing, immigration, the NHS, to name but a few.  Yet unwanted threats and scenarios can often have a habit of turning up and upsetting the best laid plans. So what could be coming down the track during the life of this new UK government?  No surprises here, this one is on everybody’s radar. But that does not make it any less dangerous, for Lebanon, Israel and the entire Middle East. ""The possibility of a large-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon this summer should be at the top of the new government’s geopolitical risk register.""  That’s according to Professor Malcolm Chalmers, the Deputy Director-General of the Whitehall think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  With the conflict continuing in Gaza and the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping continuing, Prof Chalmers believes ""we could be entering a period of sustained multi-front warfare in the region, for which neither Israel nor its Western partners will be prepared."" Ever since the Hamas-led raid into southern Israel on 7 October last year, there have been fears that Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza could escalate across borders into a full-scale regional war. Israel’s troubled northern border with Lebanon is where such a war is most at risk of igniting.  The daily exchange of fire across this border, between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia, have already resulted in hundreds killed, mostly in Lebanon.  More than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods in the north and an even greater number of people on the Lebanese side.  Domestic pressure is mounting for the Israeli government to ""deal with"" Hezbollah by pushing its forces north of Lebanon’s Litani River, from where they would have less chance of sending rockets into Israel. ""We don’t want to go to war,"" says Lt Col Nadav Shoshani of the IDF, ""but I don’t think any country could accept 60,000 of its citizens displaced. The situation has to end. We would like it to be a diplomatic solution, but Israeli patience is wearing thin.""  There are strong reasons for both sides not to go to war. Lebanon’s economy is already fragile. It has barely recovered from the 2006 war with Israel and a renewed full-scale conflict would have a devastating impact on the country’s infrastructure and its people. Hezbollah, for its part, would likely respond to a major Israeli attack and invasion with a massive and sustained missile, drone and rocket barrage that could potentially overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome air defences.  Nowhere in Israel is beyond its reach. At this point, the US Navy, positioned offshore, could well join in on Israel’s side. Which then begs the question of what Iran would do.  It too has a sizeable arsenal of ballistic missiles as well as a network of proxy militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria that could be mobilised to intensify their attacks on Israel. One way to take the heat out of the tension on the Israel-Lebanon border would be for the conflict in Gaza to come to an end. But after nine months and a horrific death toll, a lasting peace has yet to be achieved. The Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to contain and monitor Iran’s nuclear programme, was the crowning foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration in 2015.  But it has long since fallen apart.  One year after President Trump unilaterally withdrew from it, Iran stopped abiding by its rules.  Buried deep beneath gigantic mountains, ostensibly beyond the reach of even the most powerful of bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s nuclear centrifuges have been spinning frantically, enriching uranium to well beyond the 20% needed for peaceful civil purposes. (A nuclear bomb requires highly enriched uranium.) Officially, Iran insists its nuclear programme remains entirely peaceful, that it is purely for generating energy.  But Israeli and Western experts have voiced fears that Iran has a clandestine programme to reach what is known as ""breakout capability"": achieving a position where it has the capacity to build a nuclear bomb, but does not necessarily do so. It will not have escaped Iran’s notice that North Korea, an isolated, global pariah, has been steadily amassing an arsenal of nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them, constituting a major deterrent to any would-be attacker. If Iran gets the Bomb, then it is almost inevitable that Saudi Arabia, its regional rival, would also go after acquiring it. So would Turkey and so would Egypt.  And suddenly there is a nuclear arms race all across the Middle East. This depends on what you define as ""winning"".  At its maximalist, it means Russian forces overwhelming Ukraine’s defences and seizing the rest of the country including the capital Kyiv, replacing the pro-West government of President Volodymyr Zelensky with a puppet regime appointed by Moscow.  That, of course, was the original plan behind the full-scale Russian invasion of February 2022, a plan which failed spectacularly. This scenario is currently thought unlikely.  But Russia does not need to conquer the whole of Ukraine to be able to declare some kind of ""victory"", something that it can present to its population to justify the astronomically high casualties it is sustaining in this war. Russia already occupies around 18% of Ukraine and, in the east, its forces are slowly gaining ground.  Although more Western weapons are on their way, Ukraine is critically short of manpower. Its troops, fighting bravely, often heavily outnumbered and outgunned, are exhausted.  Russian commanders, who seem to care little for the lives of their men, have mass on their side. Russia’s entire economy has been placed on a war footing, with close to 40% of the state budget now devoted to defence. President Vladimir Putin, whose recent ""conditions for peace talks"" equated to total capitulation by Ukraine, believes he has time on his side. He knows there is a high chance that his old friend Donald Trump will be back in the White House within months and that Western support for Ukraine will start to crumble. Russia needs only to hang on to the territory it has already seized, and to deny Ukraine the chance of joining Nato and the EU, to declare a partial victory in the war it has portrayed as a fight for Russian survival. Again, there are plenty of warnings that this one might be coming.  China’s President Xi Jinping and his officials have stated on numerous occasions that the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan must be ""returned to the Motherland"", by force if necessary. Taiwan does not want to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing. But China considers Taiwan a renegade province and it wants to see it ""reunited"" well before the centenary of the founding of the CCP in 2049. The US has adopted a position of what it calls ""strategic ambiguity"" over Taiwan.  It is legally bound to help defend Taiwan, but Washington prefers to keep China guessing as to whether that means sending US forces to fight off a Chinese invasion. China would almost certainly prefer not to invade Taiwan.  It would be hugely costly, in both blood and treasure. Ideally, Beijing would like Taiwan to give up on its dreams of full independence and volunteer to be ruled by the mainland.  But as that currently looks unlikely – the Taiwanese have watched with horror the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong – Beijing has another option up its sleeve.  If and when it decides to move on Taiwan, it is likely to try to seal it off from the outside world, making life unbearable for its citizens, but with the minimum of bloodshed so as to avoid provoking a war with the US. Does Taiwan matter? It does.  This is about more than lofty principles of defending a democratic ally on the other side of the world.  Taiwan produces more than 90% of the world’s top-end microchips, the miniscule bits of tech that power almost everything that runs our modern-day lives. A US-China war over Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy that would dwarf the war in Ukraine. Not exactly, but there are some moderating factors here. For China, trade is all-important. Beijing’s ambitious plans to squeeze the US Navy out of the western Pacific and dominate the entire region may well be tempered by its reluctance to trigger damaging sanctions and a global trade war. In Ukraine, President Putin may be making slow, incremental territorial gains but this comes at a horrendous cost in casualties.  When the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s, it suffered around 15,000 killed over a decade, triggering protests at home and hastening the demise of the Soviet Union.  In Ukraine, in just one quarter of that time, Russia has suffered many multiples of that death toll. To date, protest has been limited - the Kremlin largely controls what news Russians see - but the longer this war goes on, the greater the risk that the Russian public will eventually baulk at the mounting number of their fellow citizens getting killed. In Europe, where worries abound over a future Trump presidency withdrawing its historic protection, a new UK-led security pact is being prepared.  As the US presidential election in November draws closer, plans are accelerating to try to  mitigate any possible downsides to the continent’s security."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5gr6p6g1xo,Story of Ukraine war victims' rescuer told in film,Much of the documentary is made up of footage recorded on Chris Parry's bodycam.,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:01.168997,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The story of a Truro man killed in Ukraine after rescuing hundreds of people from the front line has been turned into a documentary. The BBC film Hell Jumper features the work of 28-year-old Chris Parry, who went to the country shortly after it was invaded by Russia more than two years ago. Mr Parry died from gunshot wounds alongside fellow volunteer Andrew Bagshaw in January 2023. The film, documenting Mr Parry's actions, has just had its premiere for family and friends at Truro's Plaza Cinema, and is due to be shown on BBC2 on 24 July, as well as being available on the BBC iPlayer. The term ""hell jumper"" refers to those who go into the Ukrainian warzone to bring people out to safety. Mr Parry helped rescue more than 400 people before being shot by Russian mercenaries. Much of his work is captured on 10 hours of bodycam footage, which makes up a large part of the film. Director Paddy Wivell said he developed a huge respect for Mr Parry and his actions after studying the recordings. He said: ""It was in those pieces that I felt extraordinary admiration for him and thinking I could not do that, I am not brave in that way. ""I came to understand that he would not stop until he found the people he was going to evacuate. ""So, I really wanted to honour that process in the film and keep that section of the film quite long so the audience felt they were truly immersed in his experience, and in the danger that he was confronting."" One of Chris Parry's closest friends, Freya Osborne, was among those in the audience at the premiere screening and appears in the film. She said: ""In a really bizarre way, it was actually really lovely. ""I think a little boy from Truro, saving all those lives and putting himself in danger - it's incredible that there's such light in such horribleness."" The film was produced by Adriana Timco, who heard of Mr Parry's story and knew it needed to be told to a wider audience. She said: ""I found him so incredibly endearing as a person.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9031ez382do,Around the world walker set to swim Caspian Sea,"Karl Bushby, from Hull, set off on his journey in 1998.",16 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:07.087907,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Hull man hoping to become the first person to complete an unbroken walk around the world is planning a 186-mile (300km) swim across the Caspian Sea. Karl Bushby set off in 1998 and is more than two-thirds into his 36,000-mile (58,000km) adventure. However, he said tensions between the West and Russia and Iran have meant the only option open to him if he wants to continue is to swim from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan.  The ex-paratrooper said: ""This is the best route, because it's the only viable route. Failure here would be crippling."" Under the rules he set himself before beginning his adventure, which he has called the Goliath Expedition, Mr Bushby must not use any form of transport. According to his research, no-one has ever swam across the Caspian Sea - the biggest enclosed, inland body of water in the world. He said he intends to set off on the swim in mid August. Backed up by a support boat, he will be joined in the water by two members of Azerbaijan's national swimming team. Mr Bushby said: ""We have to be aware something very simple could doom this. A torn rotary cuff, pulled muscles, something along those lines could be real bad."" Explaining his decision to take to the water, Mr Bushby said: ""Being unable to cross Russia or Iran, north or south of the Caspian, means the shortest possible route - across the Caspian Sea - is next best."" Mr Bushby admitted he had ""limited swimming experience"", although he cited ""a few days floating down the Atrato River"" in the jungles of Colombia, as well as crossing the Bering Strait and navigating the Aldan River in Russia. ""I’m definitely not a swimmer, nor do I like swimming,"" he added.  In training Mr Bushby has been completing regular swims of up to 10 miles (16km), as well as gym sessions. The swim will be ""more strategy than brute force"", he said, adding ""the idea is to be in good shape by the end of each day, not a physical wreck"". He said he aims to complete a minimum of 6 miles (10km) per day, expending as little energy as possible. Mr Bushby said the Azerbaijani government is helping fund this stage of the expedition. He said: ""They [Azerbaijani government] have pretty much saved the day, stepping in just as it became clear we would not reach our funding goals this summer."" Mr Bushby described the progress of the expedition so far as ""so far, so good"". Conceding progress had, at times, been slow, he added: ""Slow progress is still progress in a troubled world. I've been lucky so many times. ""I will say in the latter half, it's being tougher, without doubt due to isolation. In general, not having a close relationship with anyone.  ""Being alone is becoming suddenly and unexpectedly harder. It’s something I didn’t necessarily think would have been a problem or had the impact it is having."" Mr Bushby said he was unable to say when he will cross the finish line in Hull. ""There is a lot to unfold between now and then,"" he said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr7ex16p32o,Russia antivirus firm Kaspersky quits US after ban,The move comes after sales and distribution of its products were banned by the Biden administration.,16 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:07.189521,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Russian antivirus giant Kaspersky Labs has told BBC News that it is leaving the US after the Biden administration banned sales and distribution of the firm's software. Kaspersky said it had made the ""sad and difficult decision"" to leave ""as business opportunities in the country are no longer viable"". It comes after Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last month that Moscow's influence over the company posed a significant risk to US infrastructure and services.  Kaspersky, which had been operating in the US for two decades, has denied the allegations. ""Starting from July 20, 2024 Kaspersky will gradually wind down its US operations and eliminate US-based positions,"" the firm said in a statement.  Its US website has already stopped selling its antivirus and cybersecurity tools, with a message reading ""purchase is unavailable for US customers"". The announcement came after sales and distribution of Kaspersky products were banned in the US. Ms Raimondo said the US was compelled to take action due to Russia's ""capacity and... intent to collect and weaponise the personal information of Americans"". ""Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the United States or provide updates to software already in use,"" the Commerce Department said. The ruling used broad powers created by the Trump administration to ban or restrict transactions between US firms and technology companies from ""foreign adversary"" nations like Russia and China. It effectively barred downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the products from 29 September, while new business was to be restricted within 30 days of the announcement. Sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department. According to the Commerce Department, the Moscow-headquartered multinational company has offices in 31 countries around the world, servicing more than 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries. At the time Kaspersky said it intended to pursue ""all legally available options"" to fight the ban, and denied it engaged in any activity that threatened US security."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0gn6nel6o,Trump's defeated Republican rivals show united front at convention,"Several of the former president's past challengers, including Nikki Haley, voiced full support for his candidacy.",17 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:07.280611,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"One by one, Donald Trump’s defeated rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination took the stage to sing his praises at the party's convention on Tuesday night. From his box just above the convention floor, Trump smiled at times as he watched his former opponents Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy voice their full support for his candidacy. If there were any doubts that this was Trump’s party, Tuesday’s programming put them to rest. “I’ll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” said Ms Haley, the former UN Ambassador who posed the strongest challenge to Trump earlier this year. She said Trump had asked her to speak at the event in Milwaukee in the name of “unity"". “For the sake of our nation we have to go with Donald Trump,” she told the crowd. Ms Haley said in May that she would vote for the former president, but her headline speech on Tuesday was her most direct endorsement of the Republican nominee yet. And when she declared her endorsement, Trump stood and clapped. Ms Haley’s arrival, however, was not universally welcomed in the arena. There was a noticeable intake of breath as she acknowledged that she and Trump had their differences. Some Republicans have struggled to forgive her for launching an aggressive campaign against their favoured candidate. Late in the race, she questioned whether Trump had the mental stamina to serve as president. A smattering of boos greeted her as she took the podium, though they were soon drowned out by cheers and chants. She deserves the booing, said Gregory Switzer, a conservative activist from Texas. “She stayed in that race a lot longer than she needed to and dragged out the inevitable,"" said Matt Bumela, a delegate from Washington state who had predicted the booing. “And said things about Trump that were negative all the way up to the end.” Ms Haley notably broke from Trump when she called for the US to continue to support Ukraine in its war with Russia. When she later said she would vote for him in November, she said the former president would be “smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me"". On Tuesday night, she told supporters of hers who might be on the fence: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him – take it from me.” “Tonight is our unity night,” said New Hampshire state Senator William Gannon, who had served as a delegate for Ms Haley. He believed Trump made the right choice to invite her to speak. “I wanna win the national election,” he said. “It was a wise move to bring her in.” The third-place finisher in the primary, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, received a far more enthusiastic welcome from the crowd. He touched on several conservative social issues, including diversity initiatives, which he said were “indoctrination”. He urged the crowd to rally behind Trump – though they were already solidly behind their current nominee. “We cannot let him down, and we cannot let America down,” Mr DeSantis said. He also took a swipe at Mr Biden’s age, an issue that is currently roiling the Democratic Party. “We need a commander-in-chief who can lead 24 hours a day and seven days a week,” he said. Daniel Willis, the 25-year-old chair of the Delaware Young Republicans, said Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley did more than enough “to bridge the gap” with Trump supporters. Lara Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, hit a conciliatory tone, telling the crowd: “You don’t have to admit that you like everything that he tweets, but Americans were better off when he was in office.” She added: “Last Saturday reminded us that we Americans must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us."" The rest of the night was devoted to the more common Republican campaign points, such as migrant crossings at the border, crime and an overarching commitment to defeating Mr Biden. Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, said there was a “literal invasion” of the United States. Dr Ben Carson, who served in Trump's cabinet, accused Democrats of “shredding the Constitution"". Trump himself led a huge standing ovation for Madeline Brame, a woman whose son was killed in New York in 2018 and has since called for tough-on-crime policies. Down on the floor, delegates said they were ready to move beyond the intra-party divisions of the primary and instead focus the party’s energy on President Biden. “At the end of the day,” said Georgia delegate Pam Lightsey, “We’re all Republicans.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0venrydg8yo,Is Brazil's Brics-building worth it?,The Brazilian president sees the Brics as a way to remake the world - but it is dominated by China.,15 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:07.374447,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"It's been more than a year-and-a-half since Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva returned to the country's presidency, back from the political dead after his conviction on corruption charges was dramatically annulled. In that time, President Lula's comeback has given renewed force to one of the world's most unlikely economic alliances - the Brics, a grouping that unites Brazil with Russia, India, China and South Africa. In his previous time as president from 2003 to 2010, Lula was instrumental in efforts to weld the Brics into a geopolitical entity, and an emerging counterweight to the West. Now the bloc has momentum on its side once again. It's come to be known as Brics Plus, after the original members agreed at a watershed summit in Johannesburg in August last year to admit a handful of new joiners, including Saudi Arabia and Iran. Not bad for a grouping that was originally willed into being by sheer high-concept financial whimsy, the brainchild of economist Jim O'Neill, who saw it more as an  investment opportunity than a new gang of nations. ""When the Brics were invented, it was pretty much an asset class,"" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""But it caught on in Brazil, because it directly spoke to Lula's aspirations in foreign policy."" At the Johannesburg meeting, Lula was particularly bullish about the group's long-term economic prospects. “We have already surpassed the G7 and account for 32% of global GDP in purchasing power parity,"" he said.  ""Projections indicate that emerging and developing markets will be those that will show the highest growth rate in the coming years,"" he went on.  ""This shows that the dynamism of the economy is in the global south and the Brics is its driving force.” But that is disingenuous on Lula's part, to say the least. As has been pointed out by the originator of the Bric acronym, who now rejoices in the title of Baron O'Neill of Gatley, all the economic growth in the group has actually come from Xi Jinping's China and Narendra Modi's India. ""None of the other Brics has performed anywhere near as well as those two,"" he said in an article written in reaction to the bloc's expansion. ""Brazil and Russia account for around the same share of global GDP as they did in 2001, and South Africa is not even the largest economy in Africa [Nigeria has surpassed it].""  As he also points out, China ""dominates the Brics by being twice the size of all the others combined"", in much the same way that the US dominates the G7. So what does slow-growth Brazil gain from being dragged along in China's economic slipstream?  Rodrigo Zeidan, a Brazilian economist based at China's New York University Shanghai, tells the BBC that Brazil and China alike see the Brics as a ""hedge"" in terms of global alliances, rather than as a top priority. ""The Brics right now, for Brazil, cost almost nothing,"" he says. ""So if the benefits are not high, it's fine. They are neither a big benefit nor a hindrance."" Since China is its biggest trading partner, Brazil is comfortable maintaining close relations with Beijing, even if the Brics grouping provides it with some ""strange bedfellows"", as Mr Zeidan puts it. Lula has certainly maintained an ambiguous position on Russia's war in Ukraine, but that is more due to Brazil's traditional neutrality in foreign policy than to a wish to support a fellow Brics nation. For Monica de Bolle at the Peterson Institute, herself a Brazilian economist, President Lula showed ""a lot of naivety"" in committing to the Brics because of his belief in furthering relations among the big so-called global south nations. As a result, Brazil has now acquired ""a China dependency"" that could harm it in other foreign policy relations, she says. ""If you are in the US, you know that the US stance on China is not going to change [whoever wins the presidential election in November],"" she adds. ""In either case, it's moving in the direction of greater anti-China sentiment. At some point, that's going to create additional reactions from China, which could put Brazil in a very difficult position, because it's perceived as being aligned with China."" One tangible gain for Brazil from the alliance comes in the shape of the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral lender founded by the Brics and described by Lula as ""a milestone in effective collaboration between emerging economies"". It is currently headed by Brazilian ex-President Dilma Rousseff. She was President Lula's political protegee, and succeeded him in 2011. But her time in office came to a chaotic end when she was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws. The NDB has not only returned her to public life, but since the bank's headquarters are in Shanghai, it makes her key to maintaining links between Brazil and China. ""Dilma is definitely huge in terms of political image. Having Dilma here in Shanghai is very important for strengthening Brazil-China relations,"" says Mr Zeidan. Brazil has also benefited directly from NDB money. In June, Ms Rousseff and Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin signed a loan deal worth more than $1.1bn (£880m) to help pay for reconstruction after widespread floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Regarding the NDB and Russia, the bank put all transactions involving the country on hold in March 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the NDB has complied with international sanctions against Russia. But Russia is due to take over the rotating presidency of the bank in mid-2025 and there is some uncertainty over what will happen then. In the meantime, Ms Rousseff is not averse to attending financial gatherings in Russia, and shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has praised her work at the helm of the NDB. President Lula is a passionate advocate of the Brics as a means of reforming global governance and giving a greater voice to the developing world.  He has criticised the ""paralysis"" of global institutions, while praising the expansion of the Brics as strengthening the fight for more diverse perspectives. But other observers retort that the Brics are themselves paralysed by their own internal contradictions, with Russia at war in Ukraine, while China and India have their own mutual squabbles. Ultimately, says Ms de Bolle in Washington, the Brics are ""a heterogeneous group of countries that have nothing in common, apart from the fact that they are big"". ""The Brics have no clear agenda that has any real weight,"" agrees Mr Zeidan in Shanghai.  ""Right now, China doesn't ask much of Brazil. However, anything that China asks, Brazil does. ""It's fine to be part of the Brics when the stakes are low. But what if the stakes rise?"" In other words, the effect of the Brics, on Brazil and on the world, may be minor for now. But if China decides to become more assertive, that could change rapidly - and Brazil could be faced with some uncomfortable choices."

Staff at Five Sisters Zoo in West Calder said they were ""utterly devastated"" that Yampil had died following an anaesthetic procedure. The 12-year-old Asiatic black bear had been rehomed at the zoo in January after being rescued from the village of Yampil in the Donetsk province of eastern Ukraine.   Ukrainian soldiers had discovered an abandoned zoo in the village when they arrived there in July 2022, five months after the Russian invasion. They found Yampil injured and traumatised after Russian shelling of the zoo. Of nearly 200 animals at the zoo, he was one of seven survivors. Rescuers initially moved him to an animal sanctuary in Belgium before he was permanently rehomed in Scotland. Romain Pizzi, a specialist vet at Five Sisters Zoo, said Yampil had been ""comfortable and happy"" at the West Lothian zoo. However, he said animals that had been rescued from such ""traumatic circumstances"" could have ""complicated health problems such as dental problems or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."" He said: ""Yampil was anaesthetised for further treatment for his health problems which were worrying the team. ""Sadly, anaesthetising animals always carries risks, and Yampil did not recover from the procedure."" The bear was being observed for signs of PTSD when he arrived at the zoo after being concussed by shellfire in the warzone. The vet said staff at the zoo were all ""deeply affected by the loss of our beloved Yampil"". He added: ""We appreciate this will be a truly sad day for all the incredible people who helped make his rescue possible. ""While the zoo will remain open as usual, we kindly request respect and privacy for our owners and staff during this difficult time."" The Asiatic black bear - also known as moon bears because of crescent-shaped yellow fur on their chests - are classed as a vulnerable species by conservation groups, with estimates suggesting there are fewer than 60,000 of them left in the world. They are medium-sized bears averaging 4.5 - 5.4ft (137-165cm) in height, and weighing 90-115kg. The males are often heavier and can weigh up to 181kg."

There are about 290 host households already in place said Derbyshire County Council, but about 15 to 20 refugees arrive each month who need homes. The council on Wednesday approved an increase in “thank you” payments from its share of the national Homes for Ukraine scheme to residents and landlords who are hosting, to £700 a month. A free bus pass scheme for Ukrainian guests in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire was also extended to March 2025. Councillor Carol Hart said: “We greatly value the role Derbyshire hosts are playing in providing safe refuge for more than 750 people who came to our county to escape the war in Ukraine. “Previous enhancements to ‘thank-you’ payments for hosts in Derbyshire has proved highly effective in reducing homelessness, providing stability, and maintaining hosting arrangements. “As a result, the number of hosts has remained relatively static over the last 12 months.” Councillor Hart said the increase would bring payments closer to current rental costs, help keep existing homes in the scheme, and attract new households to the scheme. Anyone wanting to host a Ukrainian family needs to guarantee at least six months of accommodation and agree to provide a basic level of support for their new tenants.

He is hosting about 50 leaders for the fourth European Political Community summit on Thursday. The World Heritage Site, usually a big pull to the town, has been closed since the weekend and road closures will remain until Friday. But outside the cordon in Woodstock, a stone's throw from the palace, the summit got a mixed reception. Geoffrey Naf, who runs Woodstock Butchers, predicts trade has been hit by about 50%. ""A lot of my locals can’t get in from the outlying villages because the roads are closed,"" he said. ""I have had everyone asking me, 'Are we even bothering to open on Thursday?'"" He added: ""Obviously, I’m here, I’ve got work to do and hopefully might make a few pounds over the till - but I'm not feeling very hopeful about today."" Mark Harris, from Woodstock Grocers, said his business was set to lose between £500 and £1,000 because of the summit. ""People are frightened to come into Woodstock,"" he said. ""All the signs coming into Woodstock say avoid the area, so what shoppers are going to be here? None,"" he said.  Is he proud the summit is being held in Oxfordshire?  ""No,"" he replied. ""It shouldn't be here. It should be somewhere where it's not going to be affecting locals.""  Former US president Donald Trump visited Blenheim Palace, and the then prime minister Theresa May, on the first part of his first UK visit in July 2018.   But it is thought this is the most leaders the palace - famed as Sir Winston Churchill's birthplace - has hosted at the same time. Yet despite some irritation at the road closures and disruption, there is plenty of local pride and excitement. Dog walker Isabelle Phillips had a challenging morning stroll around Woodstock. She said her dog Peggy loves officers in uniform and hi-vis jackets.  ""We’ve been playing a little game of count the police officer to see how many we can say hello to,"" she said.  ""I think it’s because the palace staff at the gates always have a tin of dog biscuits. And so anyone who is in any type of uniform, or high-vis jacket, she thinks has treats."" Janey Velasquez is a teacher at Woodstock Primary School. ""I’m excited to see the children coming in this morning because I know there will be a lot of talk about it,"" she said. ""We’re proud to be on Blenheim’s doorstep - we’re kind of relishing it. ""It’s quite nice to turn on the TV and see our local landmark there; it makes us feel important."" On a personal level, getting into work was ""probably easier than normal"", she said. ""The only difference was that I had a policeman at the bottom of my road and that's never happened before. I get the bus and it was on time and empty so I'm winning.""  Bethan Nimmo Political reporter, BBC Radio Oxford The town is relatively quiet, apart from so many police officers.  There are police officers on bikes, police officers on horses, there are armed police walking around Woodstock - which is not something you usually see. Then through the town we’ve seen motorcade after motorcade to get world leaders - from Oxford Airport I imagine - straight into the palace itself. Calum Miller, Bicester and Woodstock's Lib Dem MP - who was elected earlier this month, said he was aware there was a “mix” of feelings about the summit. “I’m aware many have been inconvenienced by what’s going on but it’s also, I hope, a source of real pride to have all of these leaders coming to our beautiful part of Oxfordshire to meet and have some really important discussions over the course of the day,” he added. Peter Henley  Political editor, BBC South Blenheim Palace is a magnificent setting for the arrivals they've flown into Oxford Airport and an hour this morning was taken up with the new prime minister Sir Keir Starmer greeting each foreign politician as they arrived. This is quite a test for the new government, not just striking the right tone and trying to get progress on hugely challenging issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine, but this is the first time this huge meeting has been hosted by the UK.  President Macron of France described it as an opportunity for a reset in our relationship with Europe. Journalists used to attending these gatherings say this is mega - closest only to the United Nations and the arrangements have been hugely complex.  Among facilities laid on, there’s a gelato truck serving refreshments in the sun, and Blenheim’s friendly ducks have been entertaining everyone. Getting on for 1,000 journalists have been brought in through Oxford Parkway station this morning, a fleet of buses taking us in through the gates of the palace to work in air-conditioned tents that have been set up in the grounds, with a live feed of all the discussions inside. So far the sun has shone and the atmosphere inside has not been too frosty, but with so many different political leaders here still anything could happen.

Adam McQuire and Holly Tann will set off in their 4x4 on Saturday to deliver medical and search and rescue materials to the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. They are members of Casus Pax, a non-profit community interest company which has been delivering aid to the country since the outbreak of the war with Russia in February 2022.  Ms Tann said the work is ""incredibly rewarding"", describing Ukrainians as the ""most resilient people they have ever met"". She said: ""The local Ukrainian people are so supportive, they offer to put us up in their houses, they offer us food, they are incredibly generous people."" The couple will take medical supplies such as spine boards, an evacuation sled, bandages, chest seals and an X-Ray machine for a paediatric hospital.  Several businesses have donated to and sponsored the mission. While the trip is rewarding, it is not without its risks, Ms Tann said. She said: ""If we ever feel like we are in danger then we make a plan to get back to safety as soon as possible.  ""With practice, and through the partnerships we have with the emergency services, we have a good way of assessing risk before we do certain things."" As part of their visit, Casus Pax will also be providing educational support to students across Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Mr McQuire said the education system was under particular strain because of the number of schools damaged or destroyed in the fighting.  He said: ""A lot of the schools have doubled in size and a lot of the resources are gone, teachers are gone, so it is a massive challenge and it is something we can assist with.""

He made the comments after meeting the country's president Volodymyr Zelensky at Shannon Airport on Saturday. Mr Zelensky made a brief stop at the County Clare airport on his way back from a summit marking the 75th anniversary of Nato in Washington. It is the leaders' first bilateral meeting in the Republic of Ireland. Mr Zelensky landed at noon and hugged and shook hands with the taoiseach after descending the steps from his state aircraft. The Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland Larysa Gerasko was also present. The meeting comes after Ukraine's largest children's hospital was bombed earlier this week. The two leaders last met on the fringes of the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland in June. Speaking at a press conference, Mr Harris said he had a ""very good meeting"" with President Zelensky and he was pleased to welcome him to Ireland. Mr Harris also confirmed that the two leaders had discussed a potential bilateral agreement on demining, energy, humanitarian assistance and food security. The taoiseach also confirmed his trip to Kyiv and that he had invited Mr Zelensky to conduct an official visit to Ireland. The Ukrainian president was also ""very eager"" to address the Irish parliament, Mr Harris added. Mr Harris also used the meeting to express his condolences for Ukrainian citizens who had died during the ""brutal illegal war of Russian aggression"". He also expressed Ireland's full support for Ukraine's bid towards EU membership. Mr Harris, who became taoiseach in April, offered further Irish assistance for thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly relocated to Russia and Belarus and entered into Russian re-education programmes since the war began. He confirmed Ireland's membership of an international coalition for the return of the estimated 20,000 children. Prior to the meeting, Mr Zelensky thanked the people of Ireland for its support. ""Thanks to Ireland for hosting a lot of Ukrainian refugees,"" he told reporters. ""You were with us from the very beginning of the Russian invasion."" The Irish government has provided €250m (£210m) in non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine under the European Peace Facility and the country has welcomed over 108,000 Ukrainians under the EU Temporary Protection Directive. Irish Defence Forces members have trained 455 Ukrainian personnel in demining, battlefield casualty care and the use of non-lethal mine clearance equipment."

But his close economic relationship with Russia’s president leaves him open to the charge of acting as Mr Putin’s puppet. The right-wing Hungarian PM says a ceasefire tied to a specific deadline would be a start. ""I am not negotiating on behalf of anyone,"" he told Hungarian radio during a brief stopover in Budapest between visits to Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and Mr Putin in Moscow. For the next six months, Hungary holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. Mr Orban followed up his first visit to Kyiv since the start of the war with the first trip by an EU leader to Russia since April 2022. That visit to the Kremlin clearly angered his European partners. Charles Michel, the head of the European Council of 27 EU governments, said the rotating presidency gave no mandate to engage with Russia on the EU’s behalf. Mr Orban admitted that was the case, but insisted: ""I’m clarifying the facts… I’m asking questions."" In Kyiv he posed ""three or four"" to President Zelensky ""so that we can understand his intentions, and where the red line is, the boundary up to which he can go in the interest of peace"". He has also been generous in his praise of two other allies, Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Meeting Mr Erdogan on arrival at the Nato summit in Washington, he spoke of him as ""the only man who has overseen an agreement between Russia and Ukraine"" so far, referring to a now defunct Black Sea grain agreement. ""China not only loves peace but has also put forward a series of constructive and important initiatives [for resolving the war],"" he said of President Xi Jinping, according to Chinese state media. The final visit on his whirlwind tour was to presidential candidate Donald Trump, another close ally who he strongly backs to win again in November and who he refers to as a man of peace. In one interview, he declared that during Trump’s four-year term as president “he did not initiate a single war"". This has been a remarkable trip in the international limelight for the leader of a small East European country with 9.7 million inhabitants. But who is it designed to impress, and could it have any effect? A key target of his message is the domestic public. Viktor Orban has had a relatively bad year so far, losing the two most prominent female politicians in his party to a scandal in February, and witnessing the emergence of his first serious challenger for more than a decade - Peter Magyar. In June, Mr Orban’s Fidesz party won an impressive 45% in European elections, to 30% for Mr Magyar’s three-month-old Tisza party. But he lost more than 700,000 votes (one in four) compared with the last parliamentary elections in 2022.  For the first time, he does not look invincible. What better way to show Hungarians that their leader was still strong than to parade across the world stage, in a global tour ""to make peace""? His mission was also targeted at an international public, in the week that his new Patriots for Europe (PfE) group in the European Parliament attracted 84 MEPs from mainly far-right parties in 11 countries. Patriots for Europe has emerged as the third largest faction in parliament, edging aside the rival Conservatives and Reformist group of Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. Mr Orban's visit to Moscow won him effusive praise from the Russians: “We take it very, very positively. We believe it can be very useful,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The US was less impressed. “We would welcome, of course, actual diplomacy with Russia to make it clear to Russia that they need to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, that they need to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity,” said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. “But that is not at all what this visit appears to have been.” At the same time, the US did welcome Mr Orban's first visit to neighbouring Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. The Hungarian leader has given very little away about the actual content of his talks in Kyiv, Moscow or Beijing. A leaked version of his letter to Charles Michel, sent from Azerbaijan, offers some clues. Mr Putin was open to a ceasefire, Mr Orban told the European Council president, provided it did not provide Ukraine with a chance to reorganise its army on the front lines. Three days earlier in Kyiv, on 2 July, the Ukrainian leader used a similar argument, telling Mr Orban that the Russians would abuse any ceasefire to regroup their invading forces.  Mr Orban was apparently ""surprised"" that President Zelensky still believed Ukraine could win back its lost territories. And Vladimir Putin told Mr Orban that ""time favours Russian forces"", according to the leaked letter. Arriving in Washington days later, Mr Orban posted yet another video on Facebook, saying he would argue that Nato ""should return to its original spirit: Nato should win peace, not the wars around it"". Unlike his Nato allies, Viktor Orban views Russia’s two-and-a-half year war in Ukraine as a civil war between two Slav nations, prolonged by US support for one of them. One thing he probably does agree on is that this autumn the conflict will become only worse. A Trump presidential victory in November, he believes, would force the Ukrainians and Russians to the negotiating table."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wej84e9l7o,German shock at reported Russian assassination plot,German political figures respond to a reported plot against Rheinmetall chief Armin Papperger.,12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.431609,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"German political figures have reacted angrily to a report that Russia had plotted to kill the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall, Armin Papperger. The CNN report said US officials had told their counterparts in Berlin earlier this year and security around him was stepped up. Germany's interior ministry refused to comment but Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock appeared to confirm the details. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months,"" she told reporters at the Nato summit in Washington. ""Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression."" In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations. ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously."" Rheinmetall avoided commenting on issues of ""corporate security"", but Mr Papperger is now being described as the most highly protected figure in Germany's economy. He told the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"". The company is one of the world's biggest producers of ammunition and has become key to supplying Ukraine with arms, armoured vehicles and other military equipment. Rheinmetall recently opened a tank repair plant in western Ukraine. Last month, it signed an agreement with Ukraine to expand co-operation in the coming years, including a joint venture to produce artillery shells. Mr Papperger said at the time his company wanted to hand over the first Lynx infantry fighting vehicles later this year and to start producing them in Ukraine soon. Although Chancellor Olaf Scholz avoided commenting on the reported assassination plot directly, he said it was well known that Germany was exposed to a variety of Russian threats and was paying close attention to them. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said ""we are taking very seriously the significantly heightened threat of Russian aggression"". Earlier this week, a senior Nato official told the BBC that Russia was ""engaging in aggressive covert operations across Europe – involving sabotage, arson and assassination plots – aimed at weakening public support for Ukraine"". The German foreign minister said the Baltic states had already highlighted the various methods deployed by Russia's Vladimir Putin in his war on Ukraine. As well as sabotage, she spoke of cyberattacks and disrupting GPS signals so that Baltic flights could no longer land in neighbouring countries. ""We have seen that there have been attacks on factories, and that again underlines that, together, we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,"" Ms Baerbock told reporters. In early May, a building complex owned by the Diehl Metall firm went up in flames in south-west Berlin. Although a technical fault was blamed for the fire, sabotage has not been ruled out. Suspicious fires have also been reported in Poland and Lithuania. Last April, Mr Papperger's garden house was set alight at Hermannsburg in northern Germany, although there has been no evidence of a Russian link. The fire was quickly brought under control and a rambling, anonymous confession purportedly from leftist militants appeared on activist network Indymedia.  The reported plot against such a high-profile German CEO has prompted widespread alarm. Leading conservative figure Roderich Kiesewetter said the chancellor should come clean with the German population about how great the threat from Russia really was. German intelligence needed to be boosted to the level of neighbouring countries, he said. ""We must take it very seriously and also prepare ourselves accordingly,"" he told public broadcaster ZDF. Michael Roth, who chairs Germany's foreign affairs committee told Bild newspaper that Vladimir Putin was waging a ""war of extermination not only against Ukraine, but against its supporters and our values"".  The head of the defence committee, Marcus Faber, added his condemnation, saying if information about Russian intelligence involvement came to light, then ""the expulsion of diplomats must follow and, if necessary, international arrest warrants must be issued""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxx24850k8yo,China hits back at Nato over Russia accusations,"The West has called Beijing a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia's war on Ukraine.",12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.532056,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"China's foreign minister Wang Yi has hit back at Nato's ""groundless accusations"" that Beijing is helping Russia in its war on Ukraine. He has also warned the Western alliance against stirring up confrontation. Mr Wang's comments, made in a call with his Dutch counterpart, came hours after leaders of Nato member states gathered in Washington DC and issued a declaration that mentioned the war. They accused China of being a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia through its ""large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base"", in some of their harshest remarks yet about Beijing.  They called on China to stop ""all material and political support"" to Russia's war effort such as the supply of dual-use materials, which are items that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. Western states have previously accused Beijing of transferring drone and missile technology and satellite imagery to Moscow.  The US estimates about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports now come from China. Beijing was also accused of conducting ""malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation"" on Nato states. In a press conference on Thursday, US President Joe Biden said that he had discussions with other leaders about spelling out the consequences for China. ""China has to understand that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, working with North Korea and others to help Russia and [their] armament, that they're not going to benefit economically as a consequence of that,"" he said. ""I think you'll see that some of our European friends are going to be curtailing their investment in China."" Pointing out that Russia had been seeking weapons from China and North Korea, he added that Nato states were looking into a new policy to turn the West into an ""industrial base"" for munitions and to develop new weapons systems. On Thursday, while speaking to the Netherlands' new foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp, Mr Wang said ""China absolutely does not accept"" all these accusations and insisted that they have ""always been a force for peace and force for stability"". In comments carried by state media, he said that China's different political system and values ""should not be used as a reason for Nato to incite confrontation with China"", and called for Nato to ""stay within its bounds"". His remarks was the latest in a flurry of angry responses from Beijing.  Earlier on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Nato was smearing China with ""fabricated disinformation"", while Beijing's mission to the EU told the alliance to ""stop hyping up the so-called China threat"". Beijing has long rebutted accusations that it has been aiding Russia in the war and insists that it remains a neutral party. It has called for an end to the conflict and proposed a peace plan, which Ukraine has rejected. But, besides the growing accusations of military support, observers have also pointed out that Beijing's purchases of vast amounts of oil and gas have helped prop up Russia's economy crippled by sanctions and replenish coffers drained by war spending.  Beijing's official rhetoric on the conflict often mirrors Moscow's - like them, China still does not call it a war. Chinese President Xi Jinping has maintained a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with both of them famously declaring their partnership has ""no limits"". Beijing has accused the US and other Western states of pouring ""fuel on the fire"" by supplying lethal weapons and technology to Ukraine for its defence.  In recent weeks, several countries have gone a step further and allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to hit targets inside Russia.  During Nato's three-day summit, which ended on Thursday, the alliance continued to underscore its commitment to Ukraine. Member states said they would support Ukraine on its ""irreversible path"" to future membership, adding that ""Ukraine's future in Nato"". They also announced further integration with Ukraine's military and support for its defence. The alliance has committed at least €40bn ($43.3bn, £33.7bn) in aid in the next year, including F-16 fighter jets and air defence support. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gr90jnxjvo,US allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato - but is that even possible?,The prospect of a second term for Donald Trump has loomed over the Nato summit in Washington.,12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.662714,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Only one US president has been at the Nato summit in Washington this week, but the shadow of another - his predecessor - has loomed over this meeting of the world's most powerful military alliance. While the host Joe Biden has presided over a message of unity from the group's 32 members, the Nato-sceptic views of his rival for power, Donald Trump, have imbued conversations here with an urgency and an anxiety. At times the smiles from world leaders in the conference hall have felt fragile. Trump “hangs over every conversation here"", said one Eastern European diplomat who asked to remain nameless.  The Republican's election as president in November ""could change everything”, the diplomat said. The fact that Mr Biden has been trying to fend off a political crisis over his frailty has only sharpened the sense that a second Trump term could bring far-reaching changes to an alliance forged in the ashes of the World War Two and still reliant on hard US military power to deter adversaries. So does Nato need to “Trump-proof” itself - as some describe it -  and if so, is it possible?  There is a lot of evidence of efforts by Nato allies to reach out already to those in  Trump’s political orbit to try to manage relationships and limit what they would see as the potential damage of a second term. But others suggest something more unmanageable. Camille Grand, a French former official who was one of Nato’s deputy leaders throughout the Trump administration, described himself as “much more worried” than colleagues who think a second term may be “Trump [term] one on steroids” but ultimately workable for the alliance.  “He doesn't have the same sort of guardrails, he doesn't have the same sort of adults in the room. And he has around him a team that is trying to turn his instinct into policy,” said Mr Grand, who is now a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.  Four members of visiting delegations, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC their concern was not necessarily that a Trump administration would withdraw entirely from Nato, as he has threatened before. Rather it is a fear that the US commitment to the alliance's core principle of collective security - ""all for one and one for all"", meaning any ally under attack can expect defence from the others - could wane. Trump’s positions on Nato have veered erratically from outright hostility - portraying the alliance as a bunch of freeloading Europeans surviving off protection paid for by US taxpayers - to suggesting his outbursts are simply part of a cunning negotiating tactic to compel more of Nato’s members to meet its defence spending targets.  He has frequently tried to rally crowds of supporters with attacks on the organisation. As the summit began, he posted to his Truth Social network that when he started as president most Nato members were “delinquent” until they “paid up” due to his pressure.   By the end of Trump’s presidency, four more Nato countries had hit the alliance’s guidelines of spending at least 2% of national income on defence. So far during President Biden’s term, another 13 countries have reached the target. That progress is frequently touted by the Biden administration and its backers, although in reality much of the increase was triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to Nato countries that did not spend enough.  That sparked outrage from some quarters in Washington, but privately his threats are said to have gone further.  At a panel event in January,  European Union commissioner Thierry Breton  described a meeting he had attended in 2020 between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  “Donald Trump said to Ursula: ‘You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you. And by the way, Nato is dead. And we will leave, we will quit Nato.’  ""It was the president of the United States of America,” recalled Mr Breton. “He may come back.""    Trump’s campaign has been approached by the BBC with a request to confirm whether the account was accurate. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, believes there remains a real concern even over Nato’s existence under Mr Trump.  “I think there is a danger with Trump that he tries to pull us out of Nato. I won't sugarcoat that,” said Dr Farkas, now executive director at public policy think tank the McCain Institute.  “The reality is Trump is dangerous to the alliance in that America is still the strongest economic, political, military power and Nato is stronger if Nato has the United States inside the alliance."" But one of those familiar with the thinking in Trump’s political orbit, Dan Caldwell from the right-wing think tank Defence Priorities, believes the former president's priority is to push European nations to invest more in their own militaries.  “I don't think he wants to withdraw from Nato, but he has said that the United States should re-evaluate its role and the purpose of Nato going forward,” he said.  “Not only the former president but more and more national security experts on the right believe the United States has really no choice but to do less in Europe. So I think that there's some larger forces at play, that will eventually force the next president, regardless of who it is… to substantially pull back from Nato."" The most detailed account of policy positions that might influence a second Trump term comes from an initiative being brought up by supporters and detractors of Trump alike. Overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, “Project 2025” is a 900-page detailed blueprint for a Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.  The initiative says a future president should “transform Nato” so that America’s role is primarily for its nuclear deterrent, while other members should field “the great majority” of conventional forces required to deter Russia.  This is in keeping with the project’s foreign policy position, seeing the main threat to US primacy as China and therefore calling for the next president to “bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions” sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  Trump himself has equivocated over the war but has said he would end it in “24 hours”. He favours brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine on terms that many Nato allies would see as surrender for Kyiv.  Trump has partially disavowed Project 2025, saying he does not know who is behind it but many of his former officials had a hand in writing it, including a former acting defense secretary.  Since Trump left office, the increase in the number of Nato members spending at least 2% of their income on defence has better insulated the alliance for the future, said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Asked about ""Trump-proofing"", he said Congress had also moved to shield America's membership of Nato from the whims of the White House, in a law passed last year. “We clarified no president can unilaterally withdraw from Nato without a vote of approval from the Senate,” Mr Coons told the BBC.  He also highlighted the $60bn military assistance package for Ukraine finally passed in April in a bipartisan effort following nine months of paralysis, after allies of Trump blocked passage of the bill through Congress.  ""It is my hope that we will continue to be a counterweight and a counterbalance to the president should we, I think, make the tragic mistake of moving forward with a second Trump term.” But Trump has repeatedly challenged current levels of US military provision for Ukraine, again arguing he could negotiate the war’s end with Russia.  Another possible attempt to future-proof US support for Ukraine is by moving more co-ordination for arms supply to Nato itself - taking it further out of reach of a future American president. Such a move has been pitched by Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as a way to ""shield"" Ukraine's supply of aid “against the winds of political change"", officials told The Financial Times.  At the summit the alliance agreed to launch a new program in which Nato will supplement, but not replace, a 50-nation “contact group” that co-ordinates delivery of weapons. Camille Grand, the former Nato official, thinks the summit may have “raised the cost” for a future President Trump to roll back the ""messaging” from Nato, but in the end, he said, Trump-proofing was impossible.  “If the US, as the biggest shareholder in the alliance, decides to be tough on the alliance, on Ukraine, there is no nothing in the [summit agreement] and previous summits that prevent it from doing that.  “But I think it's sending an important message to Trump and his team, which is that the Europeans have turned the corner when it comes to [increased] spending.” Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský reiterated that, telling me that any future president of the US that wanted to change things on Nato had the power to do so.  The real work of “Trump-proofing” at this summit has instead felt like Nato supporters pitching the alliance to conservative Americans to try to change their view. This found its most striking moment when President Zelensky appeared at the Reagan Institute for an on-stage conversation with Fox News host Bret Baier.  Mr Zelensky repeatedly raised the memory of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan, quoting Cold War lines on deterring enemies through working with allies.   Reagan is a favoured reference for Democrats trying to expose Republican divisions and what they see as the maverick isolationism of Trump. The subtext is: Reagan would turn in his grave at Trump’s Nato-sceptic stance. But it's a message that may fall flat with those who Mr Zelensky thinks need to hear it.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o,"What we know about JD Vance, running to be Trump's second-in-command",The junior senator from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and morphed from a 'never-Trumper' into a Maga champion.,1 Oct 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.764435,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"“I’m a 'never Trump' guy. I never liked him.” “My god what an idiot.” “I find him reprehensible.” That was from JD Vance in interviews and on Twitter in 2016, when the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy catapulted him to fame. In the same year, he wrote privately on Facebook to Josh McLaurin, his former law school roommate, now a state Senator in Georgia: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole... or that he's America's Hitler."" 'To go from those texts... to being Trump's biggest cheerleader, it's just kind of unbelievable,"" McLaurin, who is a member of the Democratic Party, told BBC Newshour. In just a few years later, Vance has transformed himself from ""never Trump"" into one of the former president's most steadfast allies. The 40-year-old first-term senator from Ohio is now by Trump’s side as vice-presidential running mate – and, by extension, an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 – with a reliably conservative voting record, relative youth and Midwestern roots that Republicans hope will boost support at the ballot box. On the campaign trail he has established himself as an ""attack dog"" relentlessly criticising the opposition - a role traditionally filled by a running mate, albeit one that seems less crucial given Trump's own rhetoric. Vance regularly ventures onto cable TV shows and takes questions from reporters at rallies, often drawing a contrast with the more cautious media strategy of the Harris campaign.  But his hardline views immigrants have attracted controversy. Since being picked by Trump, he's doubled down on false rumours about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. Remarks from past interviews and speeches have resurfaced, including Vance supporting a nationwide ban on abortion and calling the UK an ""Islamist country"".  He has been forced to defend a remark he made on Fox News three years ago about ""a bunch of childless cat ladies"", including Vice-President Harris. Polls indicate that the controversies have helped make Vance one of the least-popular vice-presidential nominees of recent times. They've also distracted from his populist message on the economy, an issue that the Trump campaign sees as a strength. McLaurin said that his former roommate previously felt like the Republican Party needed to give working people hope as well as economic opportunities. If unsuccessful in doing so, Vance believed a ""demagogue"" would fill that vacancy, he said.  According to McLaurin, Vance saw Trump as the demagogue - but clearly changed his mind.  Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy. A revolving cast of father figures - he changed his surname several times - and his mother's substance abuse issues resulted in a chaotic childhood, and he regularly found refuge in Mamaw's house.  When he married, both JD and his wife Usha took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents' family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance.  Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, but Vance identified closely with his extended family’s roots to the south in Appalachia, the vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest and north-east. Largely but not exclusively white, it includes some of the country’s poorest areas. In Hillbilly Elegy, Vance painted a personal portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of family members, neighbours and friends. While criticising outsiders for looking down on Appalachia's hillbillies, he took a decidedly conservative view, describing his people as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on government welfare payments and mostly failing to work hard and pull themselves up by their bootstraps. He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”. “The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.” By the time the book came out, Vance’s own bootstrap-tugging had slung him far away from Middletown: first to the US Marines and a tour of duty in Iraq, and later to Ohio State University, Yale Law School and a job as a venture capitalist in California. Hillbilly Elegy not only made him into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white, working-class voters.  He rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee. “I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016.  ""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.” But ironically, those are some of the finger-pointing themes that he has regularly raised as part of the Trump campaign.  In 2017 Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife Usha, whom he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. As the child of Indian immigrants who grew up in San Diego, Usha Vance has a different background to her husband. The daughter of academics, she also attended Yale as an undergraduate and received a master's degree from University of Cambridge.  She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and most recently worked for Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that a leading legal journal described as ""progressive"" and ""woke"". Mrs Vance resigned shortly after her husband was selected by Trump. Meanwhile, Vance had long been whispered about as a political candidate, and he saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022.   North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here. Those outside the UK can sign up here. Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, he got a kick-start via a $10m  (£7.7m) donation from his former boss, Silicon Valley powerbroker Peter Thiel.  His rhetoric shifted, and he spent less time talking about the failures of hillbillies and more about elites and Democrats. He began appearing on Fox News but also on fringier political outlets. Many of the controversial clips resurfacing now date from around the time his Senate campaign was starting to gain traction.  But the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected in increasingly Republican Ohio was his past criticism of Trump. Vance remained a Trump sceptic as late as 2020, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post. He wrote four years ago that the president had ""so thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy)"" and predicted that Trump would lose the presidency. But during the Senate campaign, Vance apologised for his previous public remarks and earned Trump’s endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate. In the process, Vance became an important player in the world of Make America Great Again politics – and signed up almost completely to Trump’s agenda. In the Senate he has been a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine. Given his short tenure in the Democratic-led chamber, the bills he has sponsored have rarely moved forward, and have more often been about sending messages than changing policy. In recent months, Vance introduced bills to withhold federal funds for colleges where there are encampments or protests against Israel's war in Gaza, and to colleges that employ undocumented immigrants. Vance also sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government off from US capital markets if it did not follow international trade law. He hit all of these themes at a speech in July at the National Conservatism Conference, saying: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."" He said the idea of the American Dream – ""This very basic idea that you should be able to build a good life for yourself and your family in the country you call home"" - was ""under siege by the left"". And he said that American involvement in Ukraine had ""no obvious conclusion or even objective that we’re close to getting accomplished"". At the same conference, he said the UK was ""not doing so good"" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country would become the “first truly Islamist country” with a nuclear bomb. He received a rapturous welcome when he entered the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, shortly after his selection was announced. But since then, the headlines have more often focused on his controversies than his folksy appeal.  His comments about Haitian immigrants eating pets, based on unsubstantiated internet rumours, were repeated by Trump during the presidential debate earlier this month and caused huge upheaval in Springfield, a city not far from Vance's hometown in Ohio. During a CNN interview Vance said he felt the need to ""create stories so that the... media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people”. But he also insisted that constituents have told him stories of pet-eating by immigrants, even though his Senate office has not responded to requests for further details.  He has moderated his views on the issue of abortion.  Vance, who was baptised as a Catholic in 2019, has expressed support in the past for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.  But he recently backed Trump's view that the matter was for states to decide.  Yet when he went further and said that Trump would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress were to pass one, he earned a rebuke from his boss.  “I didn’t discuss it with JD, in all fairness,” Trump said during the presidential debate. “And I don’t mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.”"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09234xxn1o,Poland considers downing Russian missiles over Ukraine,"Foreign Minister Sikorski says of the proposal, included in a defence agreement, ""at this stage this is an idea"".",12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.847520,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has said Warsaw is considering a proposal from Kyiv to shoot down Russian missiles heading towards Polish territory while they are still in Ukrainian airspace. The proposal was included in a joint defence agreement between the two countries signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Warsaw earlier this week. ""At this stage, this is an idea. What our agreement said is we will explore this idea,” Mr Sikorski told the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. He said some Russian missiles fired from the St Petersburg area towards Ukrainian targets near the western city of Lviv, not far from the Polish border, traversed Belarus and entered Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before turning towards their targets in Ukraine. Mr Sikorski acknowledged that such a short time gave Poland little time to react. However the proposal would theoretically cover any missile traversing western Ukraine in the direction of Poland. “We are a frontline state and Russian missiles breach our airspace. We assume by mistake,"" Mr Sikorski said. “Our dilemma is the following. If we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property.  ""And the Ukrainians are saying, ‘Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they’re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory.  ""To my mind, that’s self-defence but we are exploring the idea,” Mr Sikorski said. Mr Sikorski said an unarmed Russian missile landed near his home in Bydgoszcz about 500km (311 miles) from the Belarusian border, without harming anyone, in December 2022. Two Polish citizens had been killed by falling debris when Ukraine shot down a Russian missile near the Polish border a month earlier,  he added. Earlier this week, Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would consult with its Nato allies and seek their agreement before attempting to shoot down any Russian missiles. “If there would be such a decision, it can only be an allied decision. It will never be an individual decision,” Mr Kosiniak-Kamysz told Poland's TVN broadcaster at a Nato summit in Washington DC.  ""The key opinion is the United States, who is quite sceptical in this matter, so Poland will certainly not make such a decision on its own,” he added. Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polityka Insight, told the BBC the idea could prove perilous for Poland. “Without robust allied support, which there isn’t, this proposal is very risky,"" he said. ""From the point of view of our air defence assets and the fact we might be subject to some kind of Russian response.” Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Poland has provided Ukraine with 44 packages of weapons and ammunition, including more than 250 tanks, MiG-29 fighter jets, combat helicopters, artillery systems and portable air defence missile systems worth more than €4bn ($4.4bn; £3.4bn). Poland plans to provide additional military assistance to Ukraine this year."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx992q2nyx0o,JD Vance named as Trump's running mate,"Mr Vance, 39, is a former ""never Trump"" Republican, venture capitalist and author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy.",16 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:12.932632,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Donald Trump has named former ""never Trumper"" Republican and Ohio Senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential nominee. Republican National Convention (RNC) delegates formally selected Mr Vance, 39, on Monday after Trump announced on his social media platform he had chosen him after ""lengthy deliberation and thought"". Mr Vance is a Yale-educated venture capitalist and author of the bestselling memoir-turned-film Hillbilly Elegy. He has previously criticised his new running mate, once suggesting privately that Trump could be ""America's Hitler"", but has since become an ardent supporter. In the 2022 midterm elections, he won a seat in the US Senate with Trump's endorsement - his first time being elected to public office. After his confirmation as Trump's running mate, Mr Vance took aim at Joe Biden, claiming on Fox News that Americans elected an ""empty vessel"" in 2020 who is now ""an incapacitated president"". He claimed Democrats had lied about Mr Biden's health, and voters could ""either reward or punish that behaviour"" in November. Mr Vance added that he had said ""bad things"" about Trump but it was important to admit he was wrong. A native of Ohio, Mr Vance gained attention after the release of Hillbilly Elegy, which tells of his blue-collar upbringing and how it affected his politics. Trump said on the Truth Social platform that the book ""championed the hardworking men and women of our country"". ""As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,"" he continued. Mr Vance was confirmed at the RNC, which is taking place this week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He entered the venue on Monday accompanied by his wife, Usha, and greeted delegates as a country song played with the chorus ""let's build America first"". Addressing the crowd in the basketball arena where the event is taking place, Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Senate candidate, said: ""To JD, America First isn't just a slogan. It's his north star."" ""It's an incredible pick,"" said Donald Trump Jr, Trump's son, at the RNC. ""Truly a great choice."" The choice came before the opening of the RNC in Milwaukee on Monday, and two days after Trump survived an attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania. In the aftermath, Mr Vance tweeted that Democratic Party rhetoric had ""led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination"". Trump has said he will tone down his RNC speech and call for national unity. Mr Vance has become an increasingly important player in the world of Make America Great Again [MAGA] politics. The choice suggests the former president knows that this election will be won and lost in a handful of industrial Midwest battleground states - Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In the Senate he has been one of the biggest congressional skeptics of aid to Ukraine. In recent months, he has introduced bills to withhold federal funds for universities where students have protested over the Gaza war or that employ undocumented immigrants. He sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government out of US capital markets if it does not follow international trade law. He has also frequently appeared at Trump's campaign events, and travelled to New York City to attend Trump's fraud trial. Mr Vance, who was baptised as a Catholic in 2019, is anti-abortion. He has backed Trump's repeated statement that the issue is a matter for individual states. He is one of the youngest vice-presidential nominees in US history.  Attending the RNC, Ohio Lt Gov Jon Husted called Mr Vance ""the living embodiment of the American dream"".  ""He came from humble beginnings and he never forgot where he came from,"" he said.  Mr Vance and Trump will face the Democratic nominees, President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, at the 5 November general election. In brief remarks to reporters on Monday, Mr Biden criticised Mr Vance as ""a clone of Trump on the issues"". The Biden campaign said that Trump picked Mr Vance ""because Vance will do what  [Trump's former Vice-President] Mike Pence wouldn't ... bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c29d03574zdo,Nato vows 'irreversible path' to Ukraine membership,"The alliance also pledges more aid to Ukraine, but China warns it to stop ""provoking confrontation"".",11 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:13.121419,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Nato members have pledged their support for an ""irreversible path"" to future membership for Ukraine, as well as more aid. While a formal timeline for it to join the military alliance was not agreed at a summit in Washington DC, the military alliance's 32 members said they had ""unwavering"" support for Ukraine's war effort. Nato has also announced further integration with Ukraine's military and members have committed €40bn ($43.3bn, £33.7bn) in aid in the next year, including F-16 fighter jets and air defence support. The bloc's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Support to Ukraine is not charity - it is in our own security interest."" The ongoing invasion of Ukraine was top of the agenda at Nato's summit, and a declaration agreed by all members said Russia ""remains the most significant and direct threat"" to security. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed US-built F-16 jets are in the process of being transferred to Ukraine from Denmark and the Netherlands. It will be the first time Ukraine has received the advanced aircraft, something which Kyiv has long called for. Mr Blinken told the summit the jets will be in use ""this summer"". Nato members agreed to set up a new unit to coordinate military aid and training for the Ukrainian army as part of measures designed to deepen ties between the alliance and Ukraine. The joint statement said these measures, combined with aid commitments from individual members, ""constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership in Nato"". It said Ukraine had made ""concrete progress"" on ""required democratic, economic, and security reforms"" in recent months - but that a formal membership invitation would only be extended when ""conditions are met"". ""As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including Nato membership,"" the statement added.  It also accused China of being a ""decisive enabler"" for Russia's war against Ukraine, in some of its harshest remarks yet on Beijing's involvement. This prompted an angry response from Beijing's mission to the EU, which called on Nato to ""stop hyping up the so-called China threat, and provoking confrontation and rivalry"". China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said on Thursday that the alliance had been smearing his country with “fabricated disinformation”. China has also called on Nato to stay out of the Asia-Pacific, saying that the alliance's efforts to strengthen military and security ties with China's neighbours were undermining the country's interests, as well as peace and stability in the region.  The comments come as Beijing holds military exercises with Belarus, the country that Russian President Vladimir Putin used as a springboard for his invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was invited to the Nato summit and had meetings with world leaders, including his first with Sir Keir Starmer since he became prime minister of the United Kingdom. Sir Keir told Mr Zelensky there would be ""no change in support"" for Ukraine's war effort despite there being a new government in London.  Mr Zelensky also met US politicians from both the Democrat and Republican parties, a move designed to shore up cross-party support for Ukraine after a stand-off in Congress earlier this year saw a large military aid package delayed for several months. Nato leaders had hoped this week's summit would provide an opportunity to present a united front on Ukraine after modest Russian gains on the battlefield in recent months. However, there may be some disappointment in Kyiv that there was no clear public indication as to how long it would be until Ukraine was offered full membership. The summit - which marked the 75-year anniversary of the alliance's foundation - came months ahead of an election which could see Donald Trump, a Nato critic, return to the White House, and amid political troubles for US President Joe Biden. As Mr Biden, 81, met other Nato leaders on Wednesday, some influential Democrats publicly called for him to quit the race over fears he is too old to perform against Mr Trump, 78, in what is likely to be a closely fought campaign. Responding to a question from the BBC, Mr Stoltenberg refused to be drawn on whether the US's domestic politics could impact the alliance. He said: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to stay out of domestic political debates. ""It's important for me to continue to do what I can to ensure that that continues to be the case."" Mr Biden used the summit to reaffirm his support for Ukraine and call for more defence investment from other members which have lagged behind on spending. He said Russia was on a ""wartime footing"" in terms of defence production with support from China, North Korea and Iran - and leaders ""cannot allow the alliance to fall behind"". ""We can and will defend every inch of Nato territory"", the president added."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1x540k7vvo,Russian activist compares courts to Nazi Germany,"Oleg Orlov is defiant as he loses his appeal against a jail term for ""discrediting the Russian army"".",11 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.507919,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A Russian human rights activist has compared the country's judicial system to that of Nazi Germany. Oleg Orlov, who was appealing against a prison sentence for discrediting the armed forces, quoted a US prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials as saying the Nazis totally destroyed justice and law during their rule. Orlov, 71, who chairs the now banned human rights group Memorial, lost his appeal. He was jailed five months ago for two-and-a-half years after calling Russia a fascist state and criticising the war against Ukraine. The sentence was seen as a clear sign that Russia was increasingly cracking down on public dissent. Speaking by video link from custody in the central city of Syzran, Orlov told the Moscow city court in his final statement that he regretted nothing and would not repent. ""I'm in the necessary place at the necessary time,"" he said. ""When there are mass repressions in the country, I am with those who are being persecuted."" He also quoted a passage by Telford Taylor, a US prosecutor involved in the convictions of senior members of the Nazi regime after World War Two, who said: ""They distorted, perverted and in the end achieved the total destruction of justice and law. They made the judicial system an integral part of the dictatorship."" ""These words can be uttered now by any Russian political prisoner,"" he added.  ""These words are surprisingly appropriate to characterise the current state of the Russian judicial system.""  The appeal was attended by ambassadors from the US, UK and several other Western nations. Orlov's conviction resulted partly from an article written for French media titled ""They wanted fascism. They got it"", about Russia's apparent descent into dictatorship. His sentencing in February itself followed a retrial. In the original trial in October last year he received a 150,000 rouble fine (£1,290; $1,630) and walked free from the court. However, prosecutors complained that the sentence was too lenient and a higher court cancelled the ruling. Orlov has been an important figure in Memorial, which has for decades sought to preserve the memory of victims of Soviet oppression while also campaigning against human rights abuses in modern Russia. In 2021 it was banned and dissolved in Russia but the following year received the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski and the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties for demonstrating ""the significance of civil society for peace and democracy""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4v7ylj80lo,What world leaders thought of Biden’s Nato summit performance,"Western allies defend the US president's performance, while media in Russia ridicules his gaffes.",12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.614268,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Western leaders have rallied round Joe Biden at the Nato summit, amid concerns about the US president's age and ability to serve another term. Calls are growing for Mr Biden to drop out of the presidential race this November, and his attempts to diminish fears about his re-election bid at the summit were marred by two serious gaffes. French President Emmanuel Macron said Mr Biden was ""in charge"" and ""clear on the issues he knows well"", while UK PM Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""on good form"". But Mr Biden's first gaffe, in which he introduced Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin, was ridiculed in the Russian media.  And later in a news conference - Mr Biden's first unscripted public appearance since the debate - he referred to his ""Vice-President Trump"" when meaning to say Kamala Harris. The US president has been under pressure to quit since a disastrous performance two weeks ago in a debate with his Republican rival in the upcoming elections, Donald Trump. But throughout the summit, other Nato leaders have defended him and his ability to lead.  Mr Macron, speaking after Thursday's White House dinner, said he had had a long discussion with Mr Biden during the meal, and appealed for understanding of his flaws. ""I saw him as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well,"" he said. ""We all make slips of the tongue sometimes. It has happened to me before, it will probably happen to me tomorrow. ""I would ask you to show the same leniency that should be shown between caring people."" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also addressed the gaffes.  “Slips of the tongue happen, and if you always monitor everyone, you will find enough of them,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir said repeatedly during the summit that the US president had achieved much to be proud of there, and was ""across all the detail"". On Friday he added: ""We've been through two days of this council and come to a very good outcome... And I think he should be given credit for that."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was a privilege and a pleasure to work with Mr Biden. ""[Biden's] depth of experience, his thoughtfulness, his steadfastness on the greatest issues and challenges of our time is a credit to the work that we're all doing together,"" he said. Polish President Andrzej Duda, seen as being close to former President Trump, said, quoted by AFP: ""I talked with President Biden, and there is no doubt that everything is ok."" Meanwhile Finnish President Alexander Stubb combined a defence of Mr Biden with fears about the atmosphere in the US elections. ""I have absolutely no concern about the capacity of the current president of the United States to lead his country and to lead our fight for Ukraine and to lead Nato,"" he said, quoted by AFP. ""The only thing I'm worried about is that the political climate in the United States right now is too toxic, is very polarised, and that doesn't leave enough room for a civilised and constructive debate."" Not all Nato leaders were prepared to weigh in on behalf of Mr Biden, though. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán reportedly made almost no comments to the media in Washington. Instead he left immediately after the end of the summit for Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump's Florida residence, where the two men talked about the war in Ukraine. ""We discussed ways to make peace,"" Mr Orbán said on social media. ""The good news of the day: he's going to solve it!""  But if leaders of allied countries have been unwilling to criticise the US president for his frailties, Moscow has been similarly restrained. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the gaffes were clearly slips of the tongue and ""not our business, an internal matter for the USA"". Not so the Russian media, which have been all over Mr Biden's confusion of Mr Putin with Mr Zelensky. Official Rossiya TV showed it at the top of its 9pm bulletin, saying that ""America's vassals pretended that they'd not noticed anything"". NTV said Biden had never been so close to a fiasco and that his ""latest slip of the tongue is worthy of an Oscar"". And popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets ran an article headlined ""Senile Leaders"", comparing Joe Biden to the elderly Communist leaders of the USSR. ""What's more dangerous, a monkey with a grenade or a shaking hand on the nuclear button?"" it asked. Additional reporting by Vitaliy Shevchenko"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08kl145j3o,Starmer quizzed over Biden's gaffe at Nato summit,Keir Starmer finds himself a character witness in the debate raging about the US president's mental capacity.,12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.725648,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"From the exit poll, to the White House balcony - it has been quite a week for Sir Keir Starmer. The prime minister is clearly revelling in his new role, with his nine years in opposition over. He headed to Washington for the Nato defence alliance summit, his government not yet complete, news of ministerial appointments pinging into my inbox as we zipped over the Atlantic. From hustling for votes one week to high diplomacy the next is quite the fortnight - and perhaps one an incoming government wouldn’t choose in an ideal world. But while governing provides the capacity to shape much, that doesn’t extend to shaping the scheduling of international summits. The Nato summit in the American capital has been in the diary for months. Whoever had been prime minister would have been turning up, election or not. So, no matter that jobs still had to be allocated and Sir Keir himself had only just been sworn back into parliament, the airport beckoned. And so began an attempt to turn the scheduling logjam to their advantage. “It was great to have the ability to see so many leaders here in the first full week in office,” one senior prime ministerial aide told me. “It shortcut a process that could otherwise have taken months to get round everyone.  ""It meant we could make the most of the momentum coming out of the election and while there was maximum interest in Keir to raise all the strategic issues we wanted to and reset from our predecessors.” The prime minister sought to place his “unshakeable” commitment to Nato within the Labour tradition. “I represent the party that was instrumental in creating Nato 75 years ago.  ""It was a Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, and a Labour foreign secretary, Ernie Bevin, that fought so hard to make this a reality.  ""This is our history - we are proud of it,” he told us in his closing news conference. He added that the alternative to Ukraine’s victory was “unthinkable.” But the issue that is dominating the national conversation in the US - President Biden’s future - was catapulted to prominence again when the 81-year-old confused the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, of all places, just moments before the prime minister’s own news conference. With President Zelensky standing just yards away, President Biden managed to introduce him as President Putin. At the end of a Nato summit dominated by the war in Ukraine, and a few weeks dominated by questions about President Biden’s mental capacities and political future, it was about as bad a gaffe as you could possibly imagine. There were audible gasps in the press room as the words were uttered. Reporters from all over the world were dumbstruck at what they had just heard. Moments later, Sir Keir Starmer went from witnessing that cripplingly embarrassing moment to facing repeated questions on it. Earlier, when the prime minister had done a series of interviews with the travelling British press pack, me included, he had been asked about his impressions of the president, having spent about an hour with him, for the very first time, the day before. He was, in essence, a character witness to this raging debate, in the United States and around the world, about Joe Biden’s ability to carry on and run for re-election this autumn. Sir Keir told me President Biden had been “on really good form” and “across all the detail.” Except this latest evidence suggested he really wasn’t. Sir Keir stuck to this formulation repeatedly - that the President Biden he had seen had achieved much at the conference to be proud of. What else could he really say? But the truth is Nato’s attempt to project a united, steadfast alliance its members can believe in has been shaken by yet another wobbly moment from the leader of its most powerful member."

His visit to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach is the latest in a number of meetings between the two men.  Mr Orbán has publicly endorsed Trump's re-election bid and recently said there was a ""very, very high chance"" that President Joe Biden would lose the election.   In a tweet, Mr Orbán called the visit ""peace mission 5.0"", adding: ""We discussed ways to make #peace. The good news of the day: he’s going to solve it!"" The Hungarian leader has been frequently criticised in Europe for his pro-Russian views but remains popular among Trump supporters and US conservatives. He has also recently met China's Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a self-described ""peace"" initiative. On Wednesday, Russian newspaper Izvestia wrote such initiatives were futile, ""but Viktor Orbán may pass information he has collected to Trump's team"".  Mr Orbán told German media earlier this week that the former US president was a ""self-made man"" with a ""different approach to everything"".  A Trump victory in the US election would be ""good for the world politics"", he added.  ""He [Trump] is a man of peace. Under his four-year term he did not initiate a single war, and he did a lot in order to create peace in old conflicts in very complicated areas of the world."" Mr Orbán, whose country currently holds the presidency of the European Union, also criticised the Biden administration for failing to end the conflict in Ukraine.  “I think new leadership will provide new chances,"" he said. Mr Orbán was the first and only EU leader to back Trump's bid for presidency in 2016, but had to wait until May 2019 for his first visit to the White House. Trump has found more time for the Hungarian leader out of power. At the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, he told cheering delegates: ""The globalists can all go to hell... I have come to Texas."" His creation of a similar group in his country, CPAC Hungary, has boosted his relationships further. In March this year, after meeting Trump in Florida, Mr Orbán posted on X/Twitter: ""We need leaders in the world who are respected and can bring peace. He is one of them! Come back and bring us peace, Mr President."" In April this year, Trump sent a short video message to CPAC Hungary, saying he was ""honoured to address so many patriots in Hungary... proudly fighting on the front lines of the battle to rescue western civilisation.  ""Together we’re engaged in an epic struggle to liberate our nations from all of the sinister forces who want to destroy them.’ He referred to Mr Orbán in the same address as ""a great man"". Mr Orbán has boasted that he has created an ""illiberal democracy"" in Hungary, and claims ""progressives"" have unleashed a ""virus"" of ""migration, gender, and the woke movement""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yg2g12jno,Biden pledges air defences for Ukraine as Nato summit begins,"In a forceful defence of Nato, the president warned that ""autocrats"" were overturning global order.",10 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:18.921684,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"US President Joe Biden has pledged to provide Ukraine with five new strategic air defence systems to counter relentless Russian attacks, in a forceful speech welcoming Nato leaders to Washington DC. In brief but strongly delivered remarks at the opening of the summit, the president declared the military alliance ""more powerful than ever"" as it faced a ""pivotal moment"" in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Mr Biden said the US would partner with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Romania to donate Patriot missile batteries and other systems to aid Ukraine, amid growing civilian casualties in the conflict.  The announcement comes just two days after a Russian missile levelled a children's hospital in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv - an attack the city's mayor said was among the worst since the beginning of the war. Some 43 people were killed by blasts across the country in Monday's attack, with over a hundred more injured, officials said. Russia denied responsibility for the attack, but the UN - and analysts who spoke to BBC Verify - pinned the blame on Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky has spent months pleading with his Western allies to step up supplies of air defences. In total, Nato plans to donate five strategic air defence systems and dozens of smaller, strategic anti-air batteries over the coming year.  ""The war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country,"" Mr Biden said on Tuesday afternoon. ""Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail."" President Biden spoke for about 13 minutes in a clear voice, a marked difference from his fumbling tone during last month's presidential debate with Trump. In a speech which seemed pitched to reassure allies overseas and closer to home that he can fight off an election challenge from Donald Trump, the president warned that ""autocrats"" had overturned global order.  Meanwhile, congressional Democrats met privately to debate Mr Biden's leadership of the party and the mood was ""sad"", lawmakers told the Associated Press news agency. Later on Tuesday, a seventh House of Representatives Democrat - Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey - publicly called on Mr Biden not to run for re-election, saying the stakes were ""too high"". Visiting diplomats also expressed scepticism about Mr Biden's future, according to reports.  ""We don't see how he can come back after the debate,"" one unnamed European envoy told Reuters news agency. ""I can't imagine him being at helm of the US and Nato for four more years."" Mr Biden's team has responded by trying to show that the 81-year-old remains vigorous enough to handle the demands of the presidency.  The White House has credited Mr Biden's leadership for the expansion of Nato since Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, with Finland and Sweden joining the alliance. Shashank Joshi, defence editor at the Economist, told the BBC that the Patriot missile batteries are ""very good at shooting down ballistic missiles"" but that Ukraine ""needs a mix of systems"".  ""Without a mix of system it’s going to be spending on incredibly expensive interceptor missiles, for example for the Patriot, on very, very cheap incoming threats. That is not economically sustainable."" Leaders from the 32 member countries are converging on the US capital for the summit. Joining them is the UK's new Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Before leaving for Washington, he said he was pleased to ""confirm and reaffirm Labour's strong support, unshakeable support for Nato"". Asked by reporters travelling with him to the summit for his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sir Keir said the gathering “should be seen as a clear and united resolve by Nato allies… to stand with Ukraine and stand up to Russian aggression”. He said a deadly attack on a children’s hospital in Kyiv earlier this week “strengthens the resolve and that is a very important if tragic backdrop to this summit”. Sir Keir added the package of support for Ukraine the UK was seeking to advance at the summit “goes beyond the support that's been put in before"". Sir Keir is due to meet Mr Biden on Wednesday, as well as Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress. Tuesday's event was steeped in the alliance's history.  It was held in the very venue where the original treaty was signed decades ago, which Mr Biden invoked in his speech. Near the conclusion of his speech, Mr Biden called Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on to the stage to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour. On Tuesday evening, Trump, 78, criticised Nato allies during a campaign rally at his golf club in Doral, Florida.  The event was attended by all three of his sons, including his youngest, Barron, who was at his first ever Trump rally, according to his father, and received more applause from the audience than his brothers, Eric and Don. Trump has repeatedly lambasted Nato member states for failing to meet an agreed goal of spending at least 2% of gross domestic product on defence. Many more Nato countries now meet that benchmark since Russia invaded Ukraine. Trump told supporters that these countries were contributing “hundreds of billions of dollars” more because when he was president he had warned them “No, I will not protect you from Russia” unless they paid more to the alliance.  When Trump made similar remarks at a rally in February this year, Mr Stoltenberg said such talk ""undermines all of our security"".  But the Nato chief remained tight-lipped on the Republican candidate as the summit began on Tuesday. Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky said at an event held elsewhere in Washington DC that the whole world was ""waiting for November"", when the US general election takes place, and he urged American voters to stand by Ukraine. Mr Zelensky is due to meet Mr Biden on Thursday."

The announcement came at the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow, during which he raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin. Delhi has been seeking the release of Indians, who say they were lured to Russia on the promise of non-combat jobs in the army, but were later forced into active combat in Ukraine. At least four Indians have been killed in the fighting. On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said at a press briefing that Mr Modi had ""strongly raised the issue of early discharge"" of Indians who had been ""misled into the service of the Russian army”.  “The Russian side promised early discharge of all Indian nationals from the service of the Russian army,” he added. Mr Kwatra said there were about 35-50 Indians in the Russian forces, of whom 10 had already been brought home. The two countries would now work to bring back the remaining men, he added. Indians stuck in Russia said they were duped by agents with the lure of money and a Russian passport. Most of these men were  from poor families who were promised jobs, sometimes as ""helpers"" in the Russian army. Families of the men had appealed to the Indian government for help in bringing them back home. India's foreign ministry had called this a ""matter of deep concern"" and said it was ""pressing very hard with the Russian authorities"" to bring back its citizens. Earlier this year, the ministry urged ""all Indian nationals to exercise due caution and stay away from this conflict"". In March, Indian authorities said they busted a network of agents sending people to fight for Russia under the pretext of giving them jobs. Mr Modi took up the issue with Mr Putin on Tuesday during his two-day visit to Russia, his first since 2019.  A joint release by India and Russia after their talks said the two sides had set out nine key areas for closer co-operation, including nuclear energy and medicine. The leaders also said they would aim to boost bilateral trade by more than half to hit $100bn (about £78bn) by 2030."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yr36e6l9o,Canada to hit Nato spending target by 2032 - Trudeau,Nato members have pressured Canada to step up its spending to reach the alliance's benchmark.,11 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:19.108655,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Canada will reach the benchmark that requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military by 2032, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said. Speaking at the Nato summit in Washington DC, Mr Trudeau also hit back at those using a ""crude mathematical calculation"" to criticise an ally that ""continually punches above its weight"". As the military alliance marks its 75th anniversary, pressure has been mounting for members to meet the spending target set out by its doctrine. Canada currently spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military. The Nato founding member places seventh overall among 32 nations in the amount of money it spends on defence. But using the 2% metric, America's northern neighbour is ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the 32-member alliance.  By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%. Frustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators, who urged the country to immediately develop a plan to increase its spending.  Some US lawmakers have more bluntly criticised Canada over its Nato benchmark shortfall.  “They have the safety and security of being on our border and not having to worry about that. I think that’s shameful,"" Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson said this week.  ""I think if you’re going to be a member nation and participant, you need to do your part.”  Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters at the close of the annual summit on Thursday. ""Since 2015, we've added C$175bn in defence spending,"" he said. ""Canada fully expects to reach Nato's 2% of GDP spending target by 2032."" He added that the government has ""built in a regular cycle of review in Canada's defence, including a new defence policy update in 2028"". ""Through that process, we will continue to explore opportunities that will further increase defence spending and advance Canada's strategic interests,"" he said. The Nato alliance finds itself at a critical moment, as member nations grapple with a more aggressive Russia that continues to wage war in Ukraine.  European allies are also concerned about the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency and the dramatic foreign policy shifts that would come with it."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd91pe5r9go,Modi's balancing act as he meets Putin in Moscow,"Mr Modi's visit coincides with a Nato summit, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine will be a major theme.",9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:19.270030,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being keenly watched by his Western allies as he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on his first foreign trip since he returned to office for a third term in June. Mr Modi landed on Monday, just hours after Russian bombing killed at least 41 people in Ukraine, including at a children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking a global outcry. Photos from Moscow showed a beaming Mr Modi hugging the Russian president. A video of a smiling Mr Putin calling Mr Modi ""my dearest friend"" and telling him that he was ""delighted to see him"" has gone viral in India.  Mr Modi's two-day visit - his first to the Kremlin since 2019 - coincides with a Nato summit in Washington, where the 2022 invasion will be a major theme. India, a key global economy, has close ties with both Russia and the US and its partners and officials in Delhi are playing down questions over the timing of Mr Modi's trip. They say the annual summit is part of a long-standing strategic partnership and its scheduling has nothing to do with the Nato summit. But a sour note has been struck with the US expressing concern. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller urged Mr Modi to emphasise Ukraine's territorial integrity during his talks in Moscow.  Mr Miller also said the US had raised concerns with India regarding its relationship with Russia. ""We would urge India, as we do any country when it engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN charter, that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty,"" he said at a press briefing on Monday.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky went further - and did not mince his words. ""It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,"" he posted on X (formerly Twitter) late on Monday. Mr Modi told President Putin that India was ready to offer any assistance in establishing peace in Ukraine. Russian state TV quoted him saying that war was ""not a solution"".  He also said the death of children was painful and terrifying, a day after the deadly attack on the Kyiv children's hospital. ""Whether it is war, conflict or a terrorist attack, any person who believes in humanity, is pained when there is loss of lives,"" Mr Modi said. ""But even in that, when innocent children are killed, the heart bleeds and that pain is very terrifying."" The Nato summit in Washington, which begins on Tuesday, is being held to mark the 75th anniversary of the Western defence grouping which was mainly formed as a bulwark against the then Soviet Union after World War Two. Nato countries have been vehemently opposed to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, while India and Mr Modi have refrained from any explicit criticism of President Putin except calling for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. As Western nations try to isolate Moscow by imposing sanctions, President Putin has been having summit-level meetings with leaders of key nations like China, India, Turkey and others. Some are now asking whether Mr Modi's presence in Moscow could be to Mr Putin's advantage. Is the message India is sending out playing into the hands of Russia? “The bilateral visit this time is just a scheduling priority that we have undertaken. And that’s what it is,” Vinay Kwatra, permanent secretary to the Indian foreign ministry, told the BBC ahead of Mr Modi’s visit, rejecting any connection between the two events. India and Russia share close defence and strategic relations from Cold War days and Moscow remains a key supplier of weapons. India, which maintains one of the largest militaries in the world, has long-standing border disputes with its neighbours Pakistan and China. Experts say Mr Modi giving importance to Moscow is not a surprise and the relationship goes beyond defence procurement. “If you look at the historical trend, it [Moscow] has been one of the constants in Indian foreign policy,” Pankaj Saran, former Indian ambassador to Moscow, told the BBC. “The main pillars of the relationship include defence co-operation, energy and science technology.” Over the years, Russia has provided technical assistance to build several nuclear power plants in India.  Since the Ukraine war began, Delhi has also been buying billions of dollars of discounted oil from Moscow after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia to limit what it could sell or charge for the product. Driven by a surge in the purchase of oil, bilateral trade between India and Russia in the last few years has soared to $65bn (£50.76bn). India’s exports to Russia stand at just $4bn. Indian officials say a key priority for Mr Modi will be to address this trade imbalance and encourage Russian investment in India as well as moving some defence production to India. For the past 20 years, the West, particularly the US, has cultivated closer ties with India in what many see as a bulwark against the threat posed by an increasingly assertive China. India also became a member of the Quad - a strategic forum with the US, Australia and Japan - which is seen as a grouping aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Asia Pacific. But faced with increasing Western hostility, President Putin has developed closer strategic and economic ties with Beijing. The development has not gone unnoticed in India, China's long-time rival. A deadly brawl on the disputed border in Ladakh region in June 2020 killed 20 Indian and at least four Chinese soldiers and escalated tensions. There are apprehensions in India that it may be left out of the Moscow-Beijing equation. “One option currently being exercised by Delhi is to keep the Russia channel open to maintain the friendship and avoid taking any measures which may further aggravate Russia’s drift into Chinese arms that is being caused by US and Western policies,” says Mr Saran. Though Delhi has diversified its weapons inventory in recent decades by buying American, French and Israeli arms systems, it still relies heavily on Moscow and there have been concerns the war in Ukraine has had an impact on its defence exports. “There are reports of delays in the supplies of some spare parts and the delivery of the remaining S-400 anti-missile defence system. So, there will definitely be some discussion on this during the visit,” says Anil Trigunayat, a former ambassador and now a Distinguished Fellow at the Vivekananda International Foundation in Delhi. Delhi and Moscow are not without their own differences. There have been several reported cases of Indian nationals who were lured with false promises of lucrative job offers and ended up fighting for the Russian army in Ukraine. Four Indians have died so far in the fighting. Indian officials insist that during this visit, Mr Modi will press his Russian counterparts for an early discharge of Indians - thought to number in the dozens - still fighting in the war. India is aware that it needs both the United States and Russia to counter its rival China. Hence, it feels the need to strike a balance not to offend either of the two.  “India follows a policy of strategic autonomy and multi-alignments. We have strategic relationships with both the US and Russia. These are mutually exclusive partnerships,” says Mr Trigunayat."

The five-part series, named 'Wisdom from the Global Majority', was made in collaboration between University of the West of England students and social enterprise ACH. One of the pieces is about Ukrainian Tetyana who fled the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022 and started a children's clothing business in Bristol. MA journalism student Molly-Rose Crossley said it was a ""brilliant way"" to learn more about the community. ""It was refreshing to discuss the language used around refugees and migrants,"" she said. “It’s incredibly important for universities to work with social enterprises like ACH. ""There are limited opportunities for students and these communities to mix, so encouraging these collaborations in a university setting is a positive experience."" Other contributors to the podcasts travelled to the UK from places such as Sudan and Afghanistan and worked with ACH to start new businesses. ACH’s marketing and communications officer Sena Vicdan said: “We are incredibly excited to launch our new podcast series, which provides a platform for individuals from refugee and migrant backgrounds to share their powerful stories. “By creating a platform for their narratives, we're promoting equitable representation and celebrating the rich diversity within our community.” The podcast series begins on Tuesday 9 July and will be released on the second Tuesday of every month on Soundcloud.

The main children's hospital in the capital Kyiv was among buildings hit in cities across the country on Monday. Two people died when a missile flattened part of the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - and a search for survivors beneath the rubble continued into the early hours of Tuesday. Elsewhere, the governor of Russia's southern Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, said four people had died in Ukrainian strikes in the last 24 hours. On Monday, Russia denied targeting the Kyiv hospital, saying it had been hit by fragments of a Ukrainian air defence missile, while Ukraine said it had found remnants of a Russian cruise missile. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack ""brutal"" and described his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as a ""bloody criminal"". Nato is preparing to hold a summit  later on Tuesday in Washington, where the military bloc's response to the invasion of Ukraine will be high on the agenda.  World leaders allied to Ukraine have condemned the attack, including the new British Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer.  He said ""attacking innocent children"" was ""the most depraved of actions"" and promised continued support for Kyiv after the change of government in the UK. Calling the strikes a ""horrific reminder of Russia's brutality"", US President Joe Biden said additional support for Ukraine's air defence systems would soon be announced. Mr Zelensky said that Russia had launched more than 40 missiles on Monday, damaging almost 100 buildings in Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Pictures from the scene of the blast at the Kyiv hospital - which specialises in cancer treatment and organ transplants - showed children hooked up to IV drips sitting outside the damaged facility awaiting evacuation. Rescue workers and medics dug through the rubble to look for survivors, though it was unclear how many were still trapped. On Monday afternoon, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 16 people, including seven children, had been injured in the hospital strike. He said the attacks across the city were among the worst Kyiv had faced since the beginning of the war, as he ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Tuesday and cancelled entertainment events. Following the strike, Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina wore a black ribbon as a mark of respect when she played in the round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday afternoon. She fought back tears during her post-match interview, saying: ""It wasn't easy to focus today on the match.  ""Since the morning it was difficult to read the news. To go on the court is extremely tough."" The UN's human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has said civilian casualties have been mounting in recent months, as Russia renewed its air campaign.  A recent report said May was the deadliest month for civilian deaths in almost a year. On Tuesday morning, the governor of the Rostov region in southern Russia said a fire had broken out at a powerplant after Ukraine launched ""tens"" of drones."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lkq58q5d1o,Biden condemns 'Russian brutality' after deadly Ukraine strikes,The US president promised boosts to Ukraine’s air defences ahead of a Nato meeting in Washington.,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:24.539047,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"US President Joe Biden has condemned a wave of Russian missile strikes that killed at least 38 people in Ukraine as a ""horrific reminder of Russia's brutality"", as he vowed to strengthen Kyiv's air defences. At least 190 were injured across the country, including some at Ukraine's biggest children's hospital in the capital, Kyiv, on Monday. Ukraine published photos on Tuesday of what it said were recovered fragments of a Russian cruise missile that hit the Ohmatdyt hospital. Russia claimed the blast was caused by a misfiring Ukrainian air defence missile, but the UN said it was highly likely Moscow was behind the attack - a conclusion shared by analysts who spoke to BBC Verify. It comes as President Biden prepares to host a Nato summit in Washington later on Tuesday. He said further boosts to Ukraine’s air defences would be announced at the meeting. Leaders from the 32 Nato member states, their partner countries and the EU are gathering to mark the 75th anniversary of the bloc. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is also expected to attend. He has been urging Western allies to step up deliveries of air defences for months, amid increased Russian attacks. UN officials said May was the deadliest month for civilian casualties in almost a year.  The summit will focus on defence and deterrence in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is not a Nato member, but it has asked to be admitted as soon as possible after its war with Russia ends. Nato's outgoing secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said it is ""inevitable"" that Ukraine will eventually become a member, but not until after the war. Russia fiercely opposes Ukraine joining the bloc, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its own territory. ""We will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes,"" Mr Biden said. ""I will be meeting with President Zelensky to make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable."" The UN Security Council is also meeting on Tuesday at Ukraine’s request. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres joined Western officials in condemning Russia's missile attack on Ukraine. Kyiv's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, declared 9 July as a day of mourning following the deadly attacks on the capital. Two people died when a missile flattened part of the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - and a search for survivors beneath the rubble was completed on Tuesday morning. Ukraine's SBU security service published photos of what it said were fragments - including an engine part - of a KH-101  cruise missile fired by Russia. In a statement, the SBU said its experts' ""conclusions are unequivocal - it was a targeted attack"" by Russia. The Kremlin denied carrying out the attack and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed the blast was caused by a misfiring NASAMS air defence missile.  But the UN's human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine said there was a high likelihood that Russia carried out the attack on the children's hospital. Officials said video footage and a site assessment indicated the building was directly hit by a Russian missile. BBC Verify has analysed two videos showing a missile striking the hospital, and have geolocated each to confirm the strike location. Six munitions experts who saw the footage unanimously agreed that the missile was not an air defence missile. They all said they cannot be definitive about the type of munition used, but formed a consensus it was likely to be an air-launched Russian missile. Four of the six specifically mentioned a Russian Kh-101 missile as a possibility, in line with the claim by the SBU.  Speaking to the BBC, one expert expressly noted the presence of a small turbofan engine at the rear of the missile, which they observed was consistent to the Kh-101.  President Zelensky called the attack ""brutal"" and described his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as a ""bloody criminal"". Pictures from the scene of the blast at the Kyiv hospital - which specialises in cancer treatment and organ transplants - showed children hooked up to IV drips sitting outside the damaged facility awaiting evacuation. Mr Zelensky said that Russia had launched more than 40 missiles on Monday, damaging almost 100 buildings in Kyiv, Dnipro, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and his home town of Kryvyi Rih.  His government in Kyiv says it desperately needs new US-made Patriot air defence systems. But Western officials have been reluctant to surrender any more of the limited number such surface-to-air batteries scattered across the Nato alliance.  The UK's new Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, also condemned the attack, calling it ""the most depraved of actions"".  Britain has been one of Ukraine's key Western allies, and Sir Keir has vowed that his new administration will maintain support for Kyiv. He is set to meet President Biden at the White House on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Nato summit.  Mr Peskov told the BBC that the Kremlin would be following the gathering  ""extremely closely"". ""It is an alliance which has repeatedly and openly declared that its aim is to deliver Russia a strategic defeat on the battlefield,"" Mr Peskov. Meanwhile, Russian officials said a fire had broken out at a power substation in the Rostov region, bordering Ukraine, after overnight drone attacks. The regional governor said four people were killed and 20 injured in attacks by Ukraine over the past day. Additional reporting by Benedict Garman."

Mr Biden, who is hosting a Nato summit in Washington on Tuesday, also vowed to strengthen Kyiv's air defences. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is attending the summit, said: ""We are fighting for more air defence systems for Ukraine... We are fighting for more planes."" At least 46 people - including 33 in Kyiv - were killed across Ukraine in a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes on Monday, local officials said.  Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko declared 9 July as a day of mourning in the city. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

The family fled their home shortly before the start of the war with Russia in February 2022 and moved to London in December last year. After the mother said she wanted to take the child back to their homeland, the father successfully applied for a court order blocking them from leaving the UK. Now Mr Justice Hayden has ruled they should be allowed to travel back despite the ongoing conflict. The judgment said the city where the mother lives in Ukraine has “weathered the war effectively” and that the family are “very well-placed” to protect the child should the situation “start to deteriorate” due to the conflict. Mr Justice Hayden said: “I have no doubt that they have the real capacity to construct sensible and pragmatic solutions if a point comes where the mother considers that [the child] would be safer outside Ukraine. “For the time being, [the child] needs the safety and stability of their home and their family. This is only capable of being met with their mother in (Ukraine).” Anita Guha KC, representing the mother, said there was “never any collective intention or agreement” between the pair to permanently move to London and that the father “blatantly knew” her position. She said the court order blocking their return to Ukraine was “shocking and draconian” and that the mother would do “everything in her power” to protect her child if the situation in Ukraine deteriorated. But Jacqueline Renton, for the father, said “it is clear the parties agreed” to the child’s relocation to London and that the move was agreed as early as 2020. The father argued “it will be better” for them to stay in London, describing life in Ukraine as “very dangerous”. Mr Justice Hayden said that he was “entirely satisfied” that the child was “most integrated” in their home country.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng24pxkelo,US officials uncover alleged Russian ‘bot farm’,"The justice department says nearly 1,000 social media accounts distributed pro-Russia stories.",10 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:24.851198,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"US officials say they have taken action against an AI-powered information operation run from Russia, including nearly 1,000 accounts pretending to be Americans. The accounts on X were designed to spread pro-Russia stories but were automated “bots” - not real people. In court documents made public Tuesday the US justice department said the operation was devised by a deputy editor at Kremlin-owned RT, formerly Russia Today. RT runs TV channels in English and several other languages, but appears much more popular on social media than on conventional airwaves. The justice department seized two websites that were used to issue emails associated with the bot accounts, and ordered X to turn over information relating to 968 accounts that investigators say were bots. According to the court documents, artificial intelligence was used to create the accounts, which then spread pro-Russian story lines, particularly about the war in Ukraine.   “Today’s actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Russia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government,” Mr Wray said in a statement. The accounts now appear to have been deleted by X, and screenshots shared by FBI investigators indicated that they had very few followers.  The court documents detailed how the so-called “bot farm” was the brainchild of an RT deputy editor-in-chief who was looking for new ways to distribute stories. RT America was shut down when several major US cable TV providers dropped it shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Another RT employee developed the network, the court documents said, and later a Russian intelligence officer joined the effort, which the justice department described as an attempt “to sow discord in the United States by spreading misinformation”. Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor-in-chief, told the BBC via email: ""I’m more than happy to tend to my farm (dacha) - made up mostly of tomatoes and strawberries, but sadly without any help from the FSB,"" the Russian security service. No criminal charges have been made public in the case, but the justice department said that its investigation is ongoing. Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation, said it was not surprising that a Russia-linked operation was relying on AI to create fake accounts. “This used to be one of the more time consuming parts of their work; now it has been made much smoother by the technologies that abetted this operation,” she said, noting that the operation appears to have been thwarted before it gained traction. “Artificial intelligence is now clearly part of the disinformation arsenal,” Ms Jankowicz said. The BBC contacted X and the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment. A recent BBC investigation uncovered details of a separate attempt to bolster a Russia-based disinformation network, through the use of fake news sites populated by stories rewritten by AI."

The prime minister travelled to the US overnight for a Nato summit, on the 75th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Speaking on the plane, Sir Keir told reporters he hopes the bilateral in Washington DC will be a chance to talk about Nato and the so-called UK-US special relationship. “This is obviously a very special relationship we have between the UK and the US,” he said, adding there was “a special aspect when it comes to defence and security for obvious reasons, including our commitment to Nato”. He also told journalists that the UK had a ""cast-iron commitment"" to spend 2.5%  of national income on defence but avoided putting a deadline on when that would be met. A review of defence capabilities, to be ordered by the new government, will set out a roadmap towards reaching the target.  Defence Secretary John Healey said the review would help the government ""get to grips with the threats we face, the capabilities we need for the future, the state of our armed forces"". Pressed on when the target would be met, he said the government had to have ""the chance to open the books and get to grips with the terrible state of public finances"".  He said the defence review could not be done in weeks but would be ""done properly"" and ""done at pace"". The Conservatives, who during the election pledged to meet 2.5% by 2030, have said failure to set out a timetable would ""cast serious doubt"" on the government's commitment to security. Alongside Mr Healey, the prime minister has been joined on his trip by Foreign Secretary David Lammy and minister for European relations Nick Thomas-Symonds.  After arriving in Washington, Sir Keir and Mr Thomas-Symonds met German  Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  The prime minister also met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.  Sir Keir reaffirmed his support for Ukraine, saying: ""There's a change of government but no change of approach."" He told BBC Political Editor Chris Mason he discussed with President Zelensky ""what further support he needs"" and he said he would use the Nato summit ""to make sure that support is agreed"". The UK prime minister said he also wanted to send ""a message to Putin"" about the resolve of Nato, that it was ""more united than it has ever been"" and ""absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression"". Mr Zelensky thanked the UK for being ""with us from the very beginning of the war"". While the prime minister is in Washington, more than 300 new MPs continued to be sworn in at Westminster, ready for the state opening of parliament next week, when the government's programme is laid out in the King's Speech. During his flight to the US, Sir Keir was asked about whether he believed age restrictions the government plans to introduce in the House of Lords, forcing peers to retire at the age of 80, should be applied across the board. The size and role of the House of Lords have come under increased scrutiny in recent years, with 784 sitting members, and Sir Keir has previously suggesting an alternative, elected second chamber based on models elsewhere in the world.  This would affect Labour peers such as figures like Labour's Lord Alf Dubs, who came to the UK as a child fleeing the Nazis and has long campaigned on refugee rights, and is 91-years-old.  Sir Keir said: “We’ve got 800-plus members of the House of Lords - it’s simply too big.   ""We need to reduce it, so it doesn’t reflect on how other elected representatives are chosen in other countries, it’s to do with the size of the House of Lords."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xxeelxy7eo,Does Scotland need a new fossil fuel power station?,Scottish ministers are considering plans to build a new power station using carbon capture and storage technology.,12 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:25.137576,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Scottish ministers are due to choose within months whether to give consent to build a new gas-fired power station on vacant land north-west of the existing one at Peterhead. Environmental campaigners are against the move, saying there is no logical case for allowing a new fossil fuel power station to be built. But supporters say new carbon capture technology could slash emissions from the new site by more than 90%. They say Peterhead 2 would have a system that could capture planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and send them via pipes from the power station to nearby St Fergus - where they would be injected into depleted oil wells under the North Sea about 50 miles offshore. The current Peterhead facility has been generating electricity for more than four decades but it is now the last in Scotland to burn fossil fuels. Kate Raffan has worked there as a chemist for 10 years and despite the long-term plan to wean Scotland off oil and gas, she did not think it was a bad move for her daughter to follow in her footsteps. ""It's an exciting time for the youth of today to get involved,"" she said. ""There are always skills to be learnt in every walk of this industry and they're very transferable."" Catriona, now 19, began a commercial and procurement apprenticeship three years ago and was worried about whether it was a wise decision. But she now thinks fossil fuels could remain part of Scotland's energy mix. The imminent decision on Peterhead 2 is placing the SNP government in an awkward position, having previously opposed new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. A draft energy strategy contained a 'presumption against' new exploration but after pressure from within the party and the industry, that presumption could go.   Energy firm SSE says the new Peterhead power station will be built so that more than 90% of the carbon it creates through burning gas can be captured and stored. But opponents dispute that claim, saying no carbon capture and storage (CCS) scheme has ever consistently trapped that much CO2. They claim the new power station could double Peterhead's greenhouse gas emissions for years. Research by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has questioned the effectiveness of CCS technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector. Its study says existing projects across the world - of which there are only about 50 - usually target 90% of emissions at peak capacity with some falling as low as 65% in the early years of deployment. The existing Peterhead power station has been the most polluting site in Scotland for the past five years, responsible for emitting 1.35 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022. The Tyndall study was commissioned by environmental campaign groups Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoES) and Global Witness. Caroline Rance, climate and energy campaigner at FoES, insists the new power station isn't needed because renewables are already generating the equivalent of all Scotland's electricity demands, with some excess being exported. But aside from the environmental impact, she says that it's ""really bad for bills."" She says: ""We know that the cost of fossil fuels are driving up household bills and a new gas power station would just trap Scottish households into that same system for the next 25 years or more."" Some environmentalists argue that CCS should be reserved for industries like cement and steel production where it's more challenging to find alternatives to fossil fuels which produce the super-high temperatures needed. They say the electricity sector should focus instead on shifting to renewables like wind and solar. But the Dundee-born chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Prof Jim Skea, has argued that CCS has an important role to play in energy generation. He told the Financial Times that power stations could be the ""anchor"" source of carbon dioxide which make it economical to run CCS across larger industrial hubs. That's exactly the plan for the Scottish CCS cluster at St Fergus which will pull CO2 from the industrial heartlands around central Scotland such as Grangemouth and Mossmorran.  Finlay McCutcheon, managing director of SSE Thermal, which operates Peterhead power station, says gas provides a flexible means of generating electricity quickly when the National Grid needs it.  He said: ""I don't - and SSE doesn't - believe that you can have a wholly renewable system."" He added that energy storage, whether through large batteries or pumped storage hydro schemes, will play an important role during ""extended periods"" of low wind and solar generation. While campaigners say carbon capture is a licence for oil producers to continue ""business as usual"", the International Energy Agency (IEA) says rollout of it has been slow. Climate campaigners are concerned that the new Peterhead power station - if it's given the go-ahead - will be allowed to run for extended periods without the carbon being captured and stored - or that both the old and the new facilities will continue operating together. They cite an SSE submission to the environmental regulator Sepa which says changes in national energy security because of the war in Ukraine mean they have to consider the possibility of not closing the old site when the new one opens. The company denies this and says this is a ""worse case scenario"" but the intention is still to replace the current operation with 'Peterhead 2'. A Scottish government spokesperson said it would not be appropriate to comment on a live planning application, adding: ""A decision will be taken by ministers in due course, following consideration of the application information, consultation responses and representations made by members of the public."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4ygzlz4mzo,Canada faces pressure at Nato summit for riding on 'coattails',Canada lags behind its commitment to spend 2% of its GDP on its military and allies have taken notice.,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:32.053737,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Canada is under mounting pressure to increase its military spending as it continues to fall short of the target set out for Nato members, raising fears that the country is becoming an outlier among its allies. That message is expected to be made clear this week as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends the Nato summit in Washington DC to mark the military alliance’s 75th anniversary. Canada, a Nato-founding member, ranks seventh overall in the amount of money spent on defence among the 32-nation alliance. But it falls way short of the alliance’s doctrine, which requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military. Using that metric, Canada - which spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military - is  ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the alliance. By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%. Canada’s defence budget currently stands at C$27bn ($19.8bn, £15.5bn), though the Trudeau government has promised in its most recent budget that it will boost spending to almost C$50bn by 2030. Still, that would only make up 1.76% of Canada’s GDP, meaning the country will continue to lag behind its allies in the coming decade. Frustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators. “We are concerned and profoundly disappointed that Canada’s most recent projection indicated that it will not reach its two percent commitment this decade,” the senators wrote. The US ambassador to Canada David Cohen has also taken note, saying in a recent interview with Global News that Canada is now “the outlier in the entire alliance”. In less diplomatic remarks, US House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Monday that it is “shameful” Canada has not hit the 2% mark. “Talk about riding America’s coattails,” he said. In response, Canada’s defence minister, Bill Blair, said at the Foreign Policy Security Forum on Monday that the country will soon share a “credible, verifiable plan” to boost its military spending. “I’m very confident that it’s going to bring us to that threshold,” Mr Blair said. Meanwhile, Canada’s ambassador in Washington, Kristen Hillman, told reporters that while the pressure is on to step up, there is also “a strong recognition that Canada is a steadfast ally in all aspects”. The alliance finds itself at a critical moment.  Member nations are dealing with a more aggressive Russia that is continuing to wage a war in Ukraine. There is also the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, who successfully pushed European Nato members to boost spending when he was US president. Mr Trump has continued to speak on Nato spending on the campaign trail, once floating the idea of letting Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to alliance members who failed to meet targets.  If Canada does not meet its spending commitments, it could open itself up to pressure from Mr Trump if he wins November's presidential election.  European allies may also grow resentful, said Christopher Sands, head of the Washington DC-based Wilson Center’s Canada Institute. Canada is already feeling the consequences in other ways, he said.  It has ambitions to be part of  US-led Indo-Pacific economic talks, which includes countries like Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea.  But so far, Canada has been left out.  It has also been excluded from the AUKUS defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US. “That’s where the real rubber hits the road for Canada. Nobody invites you to the conversation because - without wanting to embarrass you - they know you don’t have what it takes to be a serious player,” Mr Sands said. Philippe Legassé, a Carleton University professor whose research focuses on defence policy and procurement, said there are a number of reasons why Canada lags behind in spending despite being a relatively financially strong country. First, the Canadian public does not see defence spending as a priority when measured against other needs, like healthcare and other social services. “Both major parties in Canada recognise that it is in their political interest to spend at a certain level that shows you are taking care of the armed forces, but not necessarily at a level where it begins to impact your other priorities,” Prof Legassé said. Another reason is that, historically, Canada did not focus on its military spending as much because it was protected by nuclear allies like the UK and the US.  It saw its value in other collective security endeavours, including peacekeeping.  At the onset of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, deficits in Canada’s military capabilities became clear and launched a wave of spending, said Mr Sands. But Canada is still playing catch up after decades of neglect and struggles when it comes to critical issues like procurement. Aside from the pointed remarks by Speaker Johnson, experts anticipate much of the pressure on Canada at the Nato summit will be made behind closed doors, rather than direct criticism aimed at Mr Trudeau. “It’s a little delicate because Canada is doing quite a bit in terms of tangible contributions,” Prof Legassé said. That includes support for Ukraine and work leading the multinational Nato battlegroup in Latvia. He added that US President Joe Biden and a number of other Nato leaders are ideologically aligned with Mr Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, and would prefer not to pressure him publicly.  “They don’t necessarily want to give fuel to the idea amongst Canadian conservatives and the general public that the Trudeau government is failing miserably,” he said."

Svitolina, 29, broke down in tears during an on-court interview after she beat China's Wang Xinyu to reach the quarter-finals. She played the match wearing a black ribbon on her white outfit, knowing there had been mass casualties from the assault on her homeland. ""Today was one of the most difficult matches in my life,"" said Svitolina. ""Mentally it was beyond anything I have ever faced but fails in comparison to what my people at home are going through."" The 2023 Wimbledon semi-finalist is one of Ukraine's most prominent athletes and has spoken regularly about the impact of the war on her country. After her 6-2 6-1 win, Svitolina said: ""It was a good performance from my side and it's a very difficult day today for Ukrainian people."" Svitolina trailed off as she began to cry, with the court two crowd offering sympathetic support. ""It was not easy to focus on the match,"" Svitolina added. ""It was very difficult to read the news and just to go on the court it's extremely tough. ""I'm happy I could play today and get a win."" Svitolina will face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals. Ukraine's Elina Svitolina is a two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist after runs in 2019 and 2023 Svitolina, a mother of one, said she did want to leave her room after seeing the news when she woke up. At least 36 people were confirmed dead and 140 were injured as a result of Russian missile attacks across Ukraine on Monday. The rare daytime attack killed at least 19 people in Kyiv, including two at the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - which sustained major damage. Svitolina, along with former Ukraine footballer Andriy Shevchenko and heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk, is an ambassador for United24, a fundraising organisation sent up by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier this year, Svitolina said many Ukrainians felt people have lost interest in their ongoing battle to repel the Russian invasion. She wants to use her on-court success to maintain awareness but admitted she feels ""guilt"" at being happy for reaching a Grand Slam quarter-final. ""Many people cannot leave the country. Many people are at war. Many people are fighting, defending our front lines,"" she said. ""We've been living with this feeling for over two years. It's nothing new. But yes [guilt] is not a pleasant feeling to have."" American Danielle Collins' Wimbledon career ended in defeat as the 11th seed was beaten by Czech Barbora Krejcikova under the roof on Court One. Collins, 30, announced in January that this season would be her last on the tour. The former Australian Open finalist was on her best run at Wimbledon, playing in her first fourth-round match, but was beaten 7-5 6-3 by 31st seed Krejcikova. Both players had chances in the opening set before Collins lost serve at 5-5. She was then broken early in the second and needed a medical timeout after injuring her leg while trailing 3-1. Former world number two Krejcikova, 28, broke twice more on her way to a convincing win. The 2022 French Open winner is into her first Wimbledon quarter-final and will face a fellow former Roland Garros champion, Jelena Ostapenko. Earlier on Court One, Latvian 13th seed Ostapenko beat unseeded Kazakh Yulia Putintseva 6-2 6-3 with a dominant performance. Ostapenko's powerful hitting from the baseline proved too much for Putintseva - the player who knocked out top seed Iga Swiatek in the previous round. This video can not be played Kalinskaya retires during second set due to injury against Rybakina Fourth seed Rybakina underlined why she is the new title favourite with a dominant performance against Anna Kalinskaya before her opponent retired injured. Rybakina was 6-3 3-0 ahead on Centre Court when Russian 17th seed Kalinskaya left the last-16 match in tears having been unable to recover from a wrist problem. Russian-born Kazakh player Rybakina is the highest seed left in the women's draw and will face Svitolina next. Rybakina, 25, is the only former Wimbledon champion left in the womenâs draw, and her bid has been strengthened by Swiatek and Coco Gauff featuring in a flurry of big names knocked out over the weekend. Rybakina dropped serve in the first game of the match and trailed 3-1 in the opener, but she then won five consecutive games, with two breaks to love, to take the first set, and the procession continued until Kalinskaya forfeited the match.

Director Yevgenia Berkovich and playwright Svetlana Petrichuk were sentenced to six years each for the production of their play The Brave Falcon Finist. Loosely based on true events, the play tells the story of Russian women who travelled to Syria during the country's civil war to marry members of the Islamic State group. The two women's defence lawyer vowed to appeal against the verdict. Held partly behind closed doors, the trial heightened alarm about freedom of expression in Russia among members of the country's artistic community.  In addition to being jailed, both women will be banned from ""administering websites"" for three years after their release. In custody since May 2023, they will now be sent to a penal colony to serve their sentences, according to Russian news agency RBC. The prosecution said the women had formed a positive opinion of IS and prosecutor Yekaterina Denisova argued the play contained ""signs of justification of terrorism"", according to RBC. At the beginning of the trial in late May, Berkovich, 39, and Petrichuk, 44, said they had staged the play because they opposed terrorism. Berkovich said the performance had been put on to ""prevent terrorism"", adding she had ""nothing but condemnation and disgust"" for terrorists. ""I have absolutely no idea what this selection of words has to do with me... I have never shared any forms of Islam, radical or otherwise,"" RBC quoted Berkovich as saying. Both she and Petriychuk maintained their innocence throughout the trial. Speaking after the women had been sentenced,  defence lawyer Ksenia Karpinskaya described the hearing as ""absolutely illegal"" and ""unfair"" and pledged to appeal against it though there was ""little hope"". ""I want you to know that these girls are absolutely innocent,"" the lawyer added. Supporters of Berkovich have suggested her prosecution was linked to a series of poems she wrote criticising Russia's military offensive in Ukraine. Russia's artistic community has come under increasing pressure from the Kremlin since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Several high-profile Russian artists, writers and journalists have come out in support of the women, including newspaper editor Dmitry Muratov and actress Yulia Peresild. The play, which premiered in 2020, won two Golden Mask Theatre Awards for best playwright and best costumes. In recent months, Russia has been subjected to deadly attacks by Islamist militants in both Moscow and Dagestan. The Kremlin has made unsubstantiated suggestions that Ukraine was involved in both incidents."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y1pjk2dzo,Children's hospital hit as Russian strikes kill dozens in Ukraine,"Two people were killed at the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital after an intense Russian barrage, officials say.",9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:32.342892,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"A children's hospital in Kyiv has been hit after Russia launched a wave of missile strikes against cities across Ukraine. Two people died when the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - sustained major damage during the blast.  Thirty-six people were killed and 140 people were injured in the strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Monday. Russia denied targeting the hospital, saying it had been hit by fragments of a Ukrainian air defence missile, while Ukraine said it had found remnants of a Russian cruise missile. Lesia Lysytsia, a doctor at the hospital, told the BBC the moment the missile struck had been ""like in a film"" with a ""big light, then an awful sound"". ""One part of the hospital was destroyed and there was a fire in another. It's really very damaged - maybe 60-70% of the hospital,"" she said. Pictures from the scene showed young children - some with IV drips - sitting outside the hospital as it was evacuated. Vitaliy Klitschko, Kyiv's mayor, said the two who died at the hospital were adults - one of whom was a doctor. He added that rescuers feared more people were trapped under the rubble. Ohmatdyt is a major hospital which carries out cancer treatment and organ transplants. ""Now we are in the process of evacuating patients to the nearest hospital.. [but] many patients are intubated and on ventilators and cannot have contact with other patients or go outside,"" Dr Lysytsia said. Hospital officials told Ukrainian TV that about 20 children were being treated in the ward which was hit. Following the strike, Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina wore a black ribbon as a mark of respect when she played in the round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday afternoon. Mayor Klitschko accused Russia of attempting the ""genocide of [the] population in Ukraine"". ""Right now the whole world can see how Russian missiles and Kamikaze drones killed Ukrainian citizens in our peaceful city.""  The mayor added that a separate maternity hospital in Kyiv's Dniprovsky district had also been partially destroyed by falling debris, killing seven people. Mr Zelensky wrote on social media that ""more than 40 missiles of different types"" had hit buildings and infrastructure in cities including Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. He called for a stronger Western response ""to the blow that Russia has once again delivered on our population, on our land, on our children"". Dnipro regional head Sergiy Lysak said one person was killed in Dnipro city and six more injured. He added that a high-rise building and a business had been hit. Three people were killed in Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken control of a number of villages in recent weeks. The Russian bombardment comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Moscow for a two-day state visit where he is due to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin. The Security Service of Ukraine has published pictures of what it says are fragments of a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile recovered from the site. Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov responded to the attacks by urging the country's allies to help quickly strengthen its air defences. ""Our defence capabilities are still insufficient... We need more air defence systems,"" he said. Ukraine's allies have condemned the attack on the Ohmatdyt hospital, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accusing Russia of ""ruthlessly targeting Ukrainian civilians"". New UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said ""we must hold those responsible for Putin's illegal war to account"". UN chief António Guterres strongly condemned the strikes, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, adding he found the attack on the children's hospital and another medical facility ""particularly shocking"". ""Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects is prohibited by international humanitarian law, and any such attacks are unacceptable and must end immediately,"" he said. The UN's human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has said civilian casualties have been mounting in recent months, as Russia renewed its air campaign. A recent report said May was the deadliest month for civilian deaths in almost a year. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06kxke71y4o,PM urged to up defence spend as Kyiv hospital struck,The general election may be over but Tuesday's front pages are dominated by UK politics.,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:32.455744,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine," Pictures of children wounded in an attack on a Ukrainian hospital are on most front pages. ""Putin bombs cancer kids"" is the Daily Mirror's headline. The Daily Mail describes the attack as an ""atrocity that shows why Britain and Nato must spend more on defence"". There is another call for an increased military budget in the Times. A former head of the Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, tells the paper Britain's forces are so worn down that they would be able to fight only a small war, for no longer than a month. He says troop numbers have fallen alarmingly because of funding cuts and ammunition stockpiles are dangerously low.  The general also warns that - as he puts it - ""the new axis powers"" or Russia, China and Iran, pose an even more lethal challenge than the Nazi alliance in 1939. In a joint article in the Daily Telegraph, Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey say the government will increase military spending to 2.5% of the economic output ""as soon as possible"". The also say the UK will be arguing that all Nato countries should adopt that target. The Guardian highlights  what it calls the first major policy announcement by Health Secretary Wes Streeting. He is diverting billions of pounds from hospitals in England to GPs, to help patients access help sooner. Less than 10% of the NHS budget in England is currently spent on primary care - a share that has been falling despite record-high demand at GP surgeries. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is accused by both the Mail the Daily Express of laying the groundwork for tax rises, after she said the public finances were in the worst state since the Second World War.  The Mail says the economic circumstance the Conservatives inherited from the last Labour government in 2010 were far worse than where the country is now. In an editorial, the paper says ""we are not in the economic wasteland Ms Reeves likes to pretend"" - and accuses her of using such imagery to justify ""difficult decisions"" that lie ahead. The Telegraph also says an institute founded by former prime minister Sir Tony Blair has predicted that the new government will have to raise an additional £50bn in taxes - unless it finds radical new ways to increase productivity. The report says the money will be needed to stabilise debt, meet the increasing health costs in an ageing society and plug the decreasing tax take from oil and gas, as the country transitions to net-zero. Sir Tony is calling for a greater use of artificial intelligence to boost growth. According to the Mirror, female jails could be converted to hold men as the UK runs out of male cells. The paper says the option is being considered as Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood prepares to announce emergency measures. The paper quotes the charity Prison Advice and Care Trust, which says many female prisoners pose a very low risk, if released. Finally, the Sun says England football fans are fuming that the German referee, Felix Zwayer, has been appointed to officiate the Euro 2024 semi-final between England and the Netherlands on Wednesday. They are asking how he could be neutral given that he clashed with Jude Bellingham in 2021, when the England midfielder was fined for comments he made about the referee.

From Bristol with Love for Ukraine has sent a total of 71 vans full of supplies to Ukraine since 24 February 2022, including more than 11,000 boxes.  On July 6 the latest van was sent off with a ceremony that included a speech from Bristol's Mayor councillor Andrew Varney. Volunteer Dr Ann Kennard said: ""People think that Ukraine is being forgotten but it's not, this country has been very positive in its help and we will not forget them."" The van was loaded with supplies from the charity that are based in the Bristol International Centre for Ukraine on Greystoke Avenue. It will take the team driving the van a few days to make it to Romania where they will then be taken over the border into Ukraine. There they go to community hubs at safe underground locations where civilians can charge laptops, mobile phones, baby-cot batteries, torches and allow cooking to take place. The charity relies on public donations. Dr Kennard, a retired lecturer from University of the West of England said: ""We have heard from our friends in Ukraine that the thing they need most is generators and we're pleased to help. ""Ukraine's power plants have been really damaged, for instance Kharkiv’s three major power plants have been completely destroyed.  ""So we know this is what they need and everyone has been so generous"". Dr Kennard explained that the group are inundated with donations of items and money which has enabled them to buy the generators to send over. From Bristol with Love was set up by Dr Razvan Constantinescu, honorary consul of Romania in Bristol. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4wypn23wo,New foreign secretary wants to reset UK-EU ties,The new UK government wants to signal its desire to engage in the face of multiple world crises.,8 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:32.660786,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"David Lammy’s whirlwind first trip as foreign secretary, organised at very short notice, is not about instant results or even brave new horizons. It is all about perception - the appearance of a new, vigorous administration, determined to hit the ground running, brimming with goodwill towards some of the UK’s most important partners. After an evening spent with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock - the two found time to watch a few minutes of England’s European Championship quarter-final - Mr Lammy’s tour moved to the bucolic surroundings of the country estate of Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. After a couple of hours of talks, it was back on the plane for a short flight north to one of Nato’s newest members, Sweden. Why Germany, Poland and Sweden? Partly because of Ukraine. Along with Britain, all three countries play important roles in sustaining Kyiv’s war effort. With the new Defence Secretary John Healey on the ground in Odesa, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s government is keen to stress that the UK’s commitment to Ukraine will remain rock solid. Following a meeting with President Zelensky and his counterpart Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, Mr Healey said the UK would provide more artillery guns, a quarter-of-a-million ammunition rounds and nearly 100 precision Brimstone missiles. ""There may have been a change in government, but the UK is united for Ukraine,"" he said, promising to ""reinvigorate"" support via increased military aid. He also pledged to fast-track the reinforcements to ensure they arrive with the next 100 days.  “We want to double down on our commitment to Ukraine,” Mr Lammy said, as dragonflies swooped over a tranquil lake and a pair of majestic eagles circled overhead. France, in the midst of its own election - one which seems destined to have far-reaching consequences - was not on the itinerary. Not this weekend. No stop in Brussels, either. Sir Keir has said the UK will not return to the EU “in my lifetime”. But Poland and Sweden are both key European partners and fellow Nato members - good places for the foreign secretary to start exploring the outlines of closer future relations. “I want to reset both our bilateral relationship and our relationship with the European Union,” Mr Lammy said, adding a reference to Labour’s still rather nebulous pledge to strike a new EU-UK security pact. Meanwhile, on a visit to Edinburgh on Sunday, the prime minister said work was already under way to improve the UK's relationship with the EU. He said his government ""can get a much better deal than the botched deal that Boris Johnson saddled the UK with"". Mr Lammy said that when European leaders gather at Blenheim Palace on 18 July for the next meeting of the European Political Community (established by Emmanuel Macron in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), “the new spirit of co-operation will be on show”. The trip comes just days before Sir Keir takes his own first steps on the international stage as prime minister, at the Nato summit in Washington DC. These are tricky times to be shoring up relationships, with France taking a lurch to the right and the US possibly on the verge of returning the unpredictable Donald Trump to office. Mr Lammy agreed this was a “tough geopolitical moment”, but said it was important not to confuse disagreements between mature democracies with the threats posed by authoritarian regimes. “I am concerned when I see Iranian drones turning up in Ukraine,” he said.  “I am concerned when I see shells from North Korea being used here on European soil.  ""And of course I'm concerned with the partnership that I see Russia brokering across those authoritarian states.” Other issues hang heavy over the new foreign secretary’s first trip, in particular the war in Gaza. In Germany on Saturday, Mr Lammy spoke to the need to strike a “more balanced approach to Israel-Gaza”. It is not clear exactly what he meant, but with ceasefire talks apparently poised to resume, finding a way to end the Gaza war and revive the Arab-Israeli peace process seems destined to consume a large amount of diplomatic time in the coming months. For his part, Mr Lammy’s famously anglophile host said the relatively new Polish government shared something in common with the incoming Starmer administration. Both, Mr Sikorski said, were “the product of the public being tired with enthusiasts on the nationalist side of politics” - a remark which perhaps only partially reflected the true nature of last week’s general election. Mr Sikorski said he looked forward to “a more pragmatic approach” from Britain to its relationship with Europe and said the two ministers had discussed “some creative ideas of how to further that”."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4zd4x46yo,England bid for Euro glory and Starmer's defence plan,"Many front pages look ahead to England's Euro 2024 semi-finalz, while the PM's plans for defence spending also feature heavily.",10 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:32.763218,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Several papers lead on the Nato summit in Washington.  The Guardian says Sir Keir Starmer will urge other countries in the alliance to increase their defence spending to 2.5% of their economic output. According to the Times, the prime minister has been accused of ""playing with fire"", because he is delaying a decision to increase the UK's military budget until after a major review of the armed forces.  The paper says that could take months, and some former military leaders say investment in the forces can't wait, given the gravity of the threats facing the UK. The Daily Telegraph says the review will consider an increase in the size of the armed forces. The paper says that will include troop numbers, which have been cut to their smallest size since the Napoleonic era.  According to the article, the review will focus on the changing threats of warfare, including a focus on drones. Separately, in an editorial, the Telegraph urges European Nato powers to start taking greater responsibility for their own security, and increase defence spending.  The paper says, despite the war in Ukraine, Sir Keir has yet to say when the military budget will reach 2.5% cent of the economic output, and the German government has approved an increase in defence spending amounting to just a fifth of what the country's defence minister said was necessary. According to the i, the national security adviser, Sir Tim Barrow, has been told that he will not be Britain's next ambassador to Washington, even though he was appointed in the final weeks of Rishi Sunak's administration.  The paper says the prime minister is now expected to make a political appointment to the job, and the frontrunners are the former Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and the former Business Secretary, Lord Mandelson. In an editorial, the Daily Express criticises Labour's decision to scrap the Conservatives' plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The paper says Sir Keir and his friends have axed a vital deterrent.  The shadow home secretary, James Cleverly, tells the paper the new government has in effect hung an ""open"" sign on the white cliffs of Dover. A report in the Daily Mail says Royal Mail will no longer use trains to transport post, after nearly two centuries of doing so.  The postal service will tell its staff today that it is planning to sell its freight trains and increase deliveries by road. The paper says the decision represents a major U-turn - coming just a year after Royal Mail opened its super hub at Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal. And ""how's the nerves?"", asks the Daily Star as it leads on tonight's Euro 2024 semi-final between England and the Netherlands.  ""Let's make history"", is the rallying cry from the England manager, Gareth Southgate, in the Daily Express.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05yyn941qo,"As Keir Starmer heads to the US, Labour readies for a possible Trump presidency",If Donald Trump returns to the White House the US could become more isolationist,9 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:39.326255,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"When it comes to Britain’s relationship with the United States, the new government has a simple watchword: continuity. One of Sir Keir Starmer’s first calls in office was to President Joe Biden. Unusually, Downing Street even published footage and audio of the prime minister making the call. To the relief of officials, Mr Biden uttered the words “special relationship”. With those words ringing, Mr Starmer heads to Washington DC this week for the Nato summit where he and his wife will attend a dinner at the White House. To the even greater relief of officials, the President will hold a private meeting with the prime minister, not something all Nato leaders will get. The PM is going mob-handed with his defence and foreign secretaries, John Healey and David Lammy. The message could not be clearer: the transatlantic relationship remains the bedrock of UK foreign policy. Much will be made of Mr Lammy’s American credentials: he has lived, studied and worked in the US. He has family there; his father is buried in Texas. He boasts regularly that he has visited the US more than France. But it would be a mistake to think Labour is throwing its lot in with a politically sympathetic Democratic president and administration. “Whoever is in the White House or Number 10 in a big election year, we must work together,” Mr Lammy told the Institute for Government recently, nodding towards the prospect of Donald Trump re-entering the White House. Back in 2018, Mr Lammy called the former US president “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath” and a “profound threat to the international order”. It wasn’t a one off: he has also accused Mr Trump of promoting racism and separately labelled him a fascist. Since then, the foreign secretary has been on quite a journey and has been working hard to build a relationship with Republicans and allies of Mr Trump. In recent months he has met an array of Trump campaign advisers - past and present - along with Republican members of Congress, including possible Trump running mate JD Vance, whom Mr Lammy refers to as “my friend”. And in a speech to the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Trump’s uncertain commitment to European security had been “misunderstood”. The message from both Downing Street and the Foreign Office is this Labour government will work with whoever lives in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Yet Labour’s preparation for a possible Trump presidency is not limited to pragmatic engagement with his team. The government is also preparing a foreign policy that assumes the long-term trend of US detachment from Europe will continue, alongside growing economic protectionism and a greater focus on domestic US issues. And that will mean the UK doing less with the US and more with other international partners. Take Europe. In recent days both Mr Starmer and Mr Lammy have emphasised their plans to agree a defence and security pact with the European Union (EU), most likely a non-legally binding political declaration. They have made clear they envisage a broad definition of security, including anything from energy and climate change to pandemics and illegal migration. It could even involve some kind of UK participation in the European Defence Fund, the body that coordinates EU cooperation on defence research. There is talk of an early bilateral defence agreement with Germany. Mr Lammy may attend a meeting of EU foreign ministers in September. On one level this is Labour’s way of trying to reset Britain’s relationship with the EU post-Brexit, using defence as a way of building bridges and fostering trust. They hope this could eventually help to improve trade relations with the EU - to boost economic growth - while not unpicking the Brexit settlement, a political row they wish to avoid. But the policy is also a more fundamental recognition that Europe as a continent needs to do more to defend itself and rely less on America’s security blanket. This is equally true of Ukraine. Kyiv fears US support could weaken if Mr Trump is re-elected. Much of this week’s Nato summit will be about how the alliance can “future proof” military support for Ukraine against American political volatility. Labour has gone out of its way to show that London’s backing will remain “iron-clad” despite the change in government, sending Mr Healey on a visit and announcing more military aid within hours of his appointment. But none of this will be easy. Labour is promising to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national output, currently about 2.3%. But that will happen only when a strategic defence review is completed and the Treasury says there is enough tax revenue in its coffers, two conditions no one expects to be achieved soon. And as for greater cooperation with the EU on defence, that will have to wait for the new European Commission to be formed later this year; it will come at a cost of long and difficult negotiations involving many compromises demanded by EU member states; and few expect France to allow the UK much access to lucrative European defence markets by easing EU procurement rules. On climate change, Mr Lammy wants to forge what he calls a “clean power alliance” of developed and developing countries that are committed to generating renewable energy in coming years. He envisages a kind of energy alliance similar to that among oil producing nations, namely OPEC. This is designed to reclaim some of the economic and technical market in renewables from China. But it is also a policy that does not involve the UK looking across the Atlantic and depending on a president who once described climate change as a hoax and who could take the US out of the Paris climate agreement. The foreign secretary has a similar approach towards developing countries, known collectively as the “global south”. He says he wants to “reconnect” the UK with countries that felt ignored or lectured by British ministers in the past, countries denied access to western Covid vaccines or adequate climate finance. The strategic aim – one also adopted by Mr Lammy’s predecessor, Lord Cameron – is to deny countries like China a free hand when it comes to diplomatic and trade opportunities in Africa and Asia. But again, this is a policy that does not involve the UK being dependent on what Washington is thinking. As for Britain’s relationship with China, Labour wants to “compete, challenge and cooperate” with Beijing. That is in stark contrast to bipartisan opinion in Washington that sees China as a long-term strategic threat. Labour is promising a full audit of UK-China relations. But if Donald Trump wins, there are fears he could trigger a full-scale trade war with China that could damage European economies and leave Labour’s central growth plan in ruins. Where the government has less room for manoeuvre is the Middle East. The US is the biggest player in the region and drives western policy. The UK has much less influence. Mr Lammy may at some point renew Britain’s funding for the UN agency in Gaza, UNWRA, drop a UK attempt to delay the International Criminal Court’s decision on issuing an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and even restrict UK arms sales to Israel. This would ruffle feathers in Washington but might be seen by analysts as internal Labour politics designed to counter the loss of a handful of seats to pro-Gaza candidates in last week's general election. It would not change the fundamentals on the ground which remain bleak. There are growing fears of a possible Israeli attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon with bloodshed on a mass and devastating scale. Would the UK support any US military action? Would Mr Starmer deploy British forces in harms’ way to rescue British nationals in Beirut? With US political leadership so uncertain, the government is having to hedge its geopolitical bets. Mr Lammy may be an avowed Atlanticist. But his first official words as foreign secretary did not mention the US once. Instead he declared: “We will begin with a reset with Europe, on climate and the global south.” BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Work is under way to restore power, National grid operator Ukrenergo said, following the strikes, which caused emergency shut-offs for consumers in the city and region of Sumy, which borders Russia. There were no reports of casualties or damage apart from the energy facility, Reuters reports. Russia continues to pummel energy facilities across Ukraine, often plunging the country into extended blackouts with people enduring sweltering summer conditions without running water, air conditioning, or life-saving medical equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says, losing all of its thermal power plants to enemy action and seeing all hydroelectric sites damaged by drones or missile strikes.  This is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption, and more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, according to the national grid operator. Poland has been diverting surplus electricity to Ukraine to help it cope with the Russian strikes, but Ukrenego has scheduled cut-offs of electricity throughout the day across the country as domestic generation and electricity imports could not cover the deficit. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo told the BBC she is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it is obvious why: all our life, all our civilisation, is built on electricity,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian air defences shot down 24 out of 27 Shahed kamikaze drones Russia launched on the night of 5-6 July, the Air Force Command has reported on Telegram. The drones were intercepted over areas including the Sumy region, using electronic jamming and anti-air defences, it said."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9vre72wpdo,Bardella to lead new far-right European Parliament group,The 28-year-old leader of France's National Rally will head the European Parliament's newest grouping.,8 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:39.510840,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The leader of France's far-right National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, will head a new right-wing grouping in the European Parliament, Patriots for Europe. The announcement came the day after Mr Bardella’s party lost the second round of France’s snap legislative election. In a post-election speech on Sunday night, Mr Bardella announced that the RN’s members of the European Parliament (MEPs) would join a “large group” that would influence the “balance of power in Europe, rejecting the flood of migrants, punitive ecology, and the seizing of our sovereignty”. On Monday Mr Bardella said Patriots for Europe represented “hope for the tens of millions of citizens in the European nations who value their identity, their sovereignty and their freedom”. He also vowed to “work together in order to retake our institutions and reorient policies to serve our nations and peoples”. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Herbert Kickl of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and Andrej Babis, the leader of the populist Czech ANO, announced the launch of the Patriots for Europe alliance last month. Mr Orban said they had signed a ""patriotic manifesto"", promising ""peace, security and development"" instead of the ""war, migration and stagnation"" brought by the ""Brussels elite"". Within a week, parties from the right wing and far-right in 12 European countries said they would join the grouping, including the Portuguese Chega, Spain’s Vox, the Dutch PVV of Geert Wilders, the Danish Peoples Party, and Vlaams Belang from Belgium. On Monday morning, the RN and Italy's right-wing populist League party joined too, bringing the group's total members to 84. Most of these parties used to belong to the Identity and Democracy (ID) group, which will now likely cease to exist. With 30 MEPs, Mr Bardella's RN contingent will be the largest in the Patriots grouping. The alliance is now the third-largest in the European Parliament, after the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and the centre-left Socialists & Democrats (S&D). Notably absent from the Patriots for Europe grouping are Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, which belongs to the European Conservatives and Reformists alliance, and the German Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), which has been politically homeless following a string of scandals earlier this year. Belgium’s far-right Vlaams Belang party chairman Tom Van Grieken said the “right-wing, patriotic and nationalist parties” that make up the Patriots alliance have “more in common than what divides us”. However, the parties do differ in some key areas – notably on their stance on Nato and on the EU’s support for Ukraine. European elections were held on 9 June and resulted in gains for far-right and nationalist parties, although the centre-right also performed well, holding its position as the largest grouping and managing to gain seats. The RN was one of success stories of the night. It won more than 30% of the vote, double that of French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renaissance party. This spurred Mr Macron to call snap parliamentary elections. While the RN came out on top in the first round on 30 June, it lost to a left-wing coalition and to Mr Macron’s own Ensemble alliance in the second round, which took place on 7 July."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vel0q7jv9o,After France's election shock comes the real power struggle,"France’s left-wing bloc has won the election - now the real battle begins, writes Andrew Harding.",8 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:39.614905,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"The drama and vitriol of France’s sudden summer election is over. Now comes the drama and vitriol of stage two - and what could be a much longer and equally agitated struggle to build a functional coalition out of the inconclusive results of Saturday’s vote. “A lot of things are unclear. We know who lost but we don’t know who won. Can we learn the art of compromise which is so unusual for us? Nobody knows - the signs are not necessarily good,” Sylvie Kauffmann, a newspaper columnist for Le Monde, told me. The risks of deadlock – for France itself, for its constitutional order, for European stability, and even for Ukraine’s war against Russian aggression – are serious. But it’s worth remembering that this country is no stranger to coping with political upheavals. Revolutions aside, there was the chaos and revolts that followed World War Two and eventually upended France’s constitutional order, leading to the current system of government, known as the Fifth Republic. And more recently there were the challenges of “cohabitation”, when presidents and prime ministers from rival parties were obliged to share power. As politicians now sidle away for their summer holidays, or refocus their attention on the imminent Paris Olympics, it seems more than likely that the political temperature in France will subside by a degree or two, at least briefly. But the cohabitation battles of the 1980s and 1990s look like gentlemanly squabbles over a wine menu compared with the furious, guillotines-at-dawn brawls that many observers expect to preoccupy France’s National Assembly for weeks, or even months, to come. Some wonder if the French electorate – by saddling parliament with three minority blocks of almost equal size – has rendered the country “ungovernable,” or whether it is simply faced with the sort of deal-making challenge that so many other European nations wrestle with almost as a matter of course. Having emerged, to almost universal surprise, with the most seats at this parliamentary election, France’s left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NPF) has now earned the right to pick – or try to pick - the next prime minister and to implement its agenda. But with no working majority, any viable candidate will need to win support from other, more centrist parties. Who could possibly fit that bill? The NPF was quick to unite around a common platform ahead of the elections. But it contains deep political rifts – stretching as it does from anti-capitalists and communists to mainstream social democrats. The coalition is also home to some divisive figures, like the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who could quickly trigger the coalition’s collapse over the factionalism that has often marked the left of French politics. Some wonder if the Green Party leader, Marine Tondelier, might be a good fit. Her relatively low profile could be an asset in a political landscape scarred by years of deeply personal, and sometimes vitriolic, feuding. In the midst of this, President Emmanuel Macron remains on his throne, scarred by self-inflicted political wounds, but arguably a little stronger than he was a few days ago. His centrist grouping lost almost a third of its seats in the National Assembly as a result of his entirely unnecessary electoral gamble to dissolve parliament and call elections. But a disciplined frenzy of deal-making with the NPF helped it cling onto many more seats in the second round than the pollsters predicted. Could deadlock in parliament enable Mr Macron to float above the chaos and strengthen his position? Even his allies seem sceptical, convinced he is now trapped in a “stranglehold” between the extremes he once promised to banish from French political life. “Today, the President of the Republic will maintain a small margin of manoeuvre to act. But he will no longer be the political programmatic driving force in the country. From this point of view, after seven years, Macronism is dead,” Gilles Legendre, a disillusioned former MP who used to lead Macron’s party in the Assembly, told the BBC. As for the far-right National Rally (RN), it will no doubt recover quickly from the shock of Sunday night’s results, which prompted sombre silence at the party’s headquarters - a jarring contrast with the euphoric street celebrations by left-wing voters which swept through parts of Paris that same evening. The RN has already sought to reframe its third-place disappointment as the result of cynical deal-making by a “dishonest alliance” of its rivals, rather than evidence of its own shallow pool of credible candidates and its failure to convince enough French voters of the sincerity of its move away from the extreme right. The RN will surely try to promote its own agenda – including a clampdown on immigration and reforms of schools and policing. Its commitment to supporting Ukraine remains unclear, given the party’s recent support for the Kremlin and its occupation of Crimea. The RN must now be hoping that the Assembly is either deadlocked or dominated by an economically profligate far-left agenda that could further threaten France’s already strained budget. Months, or even years, of turmoil could then give the party a chance to portray itself as a stable and modernising force, thwarted by left-wing extremists and old elites. That in turn could, potentially, give the RN a good chance of increasing its vote share in any subsequent snap parliamentary election, or – and this is the real prize – sweeping its leader Marine Le Pen into the Presidency in 2027.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724532nqyno,'We've learnt to do surgery without electricity': Ukraine's power cuts worsen,"Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid, forcing Ukrainians to live and work by torch light.",6 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:39.709181,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Power supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son.  He was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication. ""We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,” Tetiana tells the BBC. Ukrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country. Persistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day. Tetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant.  She has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down. Power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too. ""Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,” she says. “My son can die if he doesn't get oxygen. I'm lost for words.” Recent blackouts have lasted as long as 12 hours a day in Tetiana's neighbourhood. For millions of Ukrainians, the absence of power can mean no running water, air conditioning, lifts or access to life-saving equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says. This is more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. It is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption – or Slovakia, Lavtia, Lithuania and Estonia combined, Ukrenergo says. ""All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. All hydropower plants in our country are damaged by Russian missiles or drones,"" Ukrenergo spokeswoman Maria Tsaturian tells the BBC. The lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems. To cope with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country, which last for many hours a day every day. As a result, millions of Ukrainians have become increasingly reliant on fuel-powered generators or big power banks. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been experiencing lengthy power cuts. Roksolana was elected by residents of her 24-storey apartment block to help run the building's facilities. She says living in tower blocks is not easy because power cuts also mean no running water on the upper floors. “The lifts are not working either, so mothers with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on when there is electricity,” she adds. “They've got to stay indoors for six hours on end, our elderly ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread."" Such residents in tall buildings are stuck inside their sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working.  They are also more exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go to the safety of the bomb shelters, which are typically located underground. In Zaporizhzhia, dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv says appointments have to be rescheduled at the last moment, and there've been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery. ""If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have started. There's no other way - we can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow,"" he says. ""Literally a couple of weeks ago power cuts became particularly frequent. Of course they're very disruptive."" To perform urgent or less complicated operations during blackouts, Mr Stefaniv uses a head torch. This is a skill he acquired and perfected while treating soldiers on the front line, and his firm still provides free or heavily discounted services for members of the Ukrainian army. ""I can treat toothache or swelling without electricity. We've learnt to perform surgery without electricity,"" he says. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it's obvious why: all our life, all our civilization, is built on electricity. You just have to destroy your enemy's power grid, and they will have no economy, and they will have no life,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom."""

The Telegraph says freeing prisoners who have served as little as 40% of their sentence is among the options being considered by Labour to address overcrowding in jails.  A prison service source is quoted by the paper as saying the proposal ""feels like the only measure that buys time"" with reports prisons could run out of spaces within weeks.  The article does not carry a direct response from ministers, but says no final decision has been taken and the matter will have to be agreed by the Cabinet.

Robert Fico was shot several times on 15 May while greeting people outside a cultural centre in Handlova, about 180km (112 miles) from the capital Bratislava, after holding a meeting there. He was rushed to hospital to undergo emergency surgery, before later being discharged to receive care at home. On Friday, Mr Fico spoke during a ceremony at Devin Castle in Bratislava to mark Saints Cyril and Methodius Day, a public holiday in Slovakia. Cyril and Methodius were brothers credited with converting Slavic people in the region to Christianity in the 9th Century and creating an early version of the Cyrillic alphabet. Mr Fico, 59, used a speech at the commemoration to criticise the supposed expansion of progressive ideologies and the West's stance towards Russia over the war in Ukraine. He said ""meaningless"" liberal ideas were ""spreading like cancer"", and that there were ""not enough peace talks"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the Russian invasion, according to local and international media reports. Mr Fico, a populist who returned to office last October, is a divisive figure both domestically and within the wider EU, with calls to end military aid to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. He has also proposed abolishing Slovakia's public broadcaster. His attacker, previously named as 71-year-old Jurac C, has been described as a writer and political activist. Footage of the incident shows a gun being pulled in the crowd and five shots ringing out. The Slovakian PM was then bundled into a car by his bodyguards while the suspected shooter was detained at the scene. In a video address posted on social media on 5 June, Mr Fico said he forgave his assailant and felt no hatred towards him, while blaming the attack on his parliamentary opposition."

He insists that he wants to reset relations with governments around the UK, hence his decision to make an early dash through Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as meeting English mayors, in his first few days in the job. Sir Keir is attempting to style himself as the sensible leader of a grown-up government, a man whose watchwords are moderation and co-operation. The intended contrast is not just with politicians on his right but also with those on his left, not least his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, who is back in parliament as an independent. It is striking that Mr Corbyn secured 40% of the vote in 2017 when he lost to Theresa May while Sir Keir's victory was built on a 33.7% share and the second lowest turnout since World War Two. In other words the new prime minister's well of support may be shallower than a majority of 174, just shy of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, suggests. In fact, Scotland was the only part of the UK where Labour’s vote share rose sharply in this election, jumping by 17 percentage points as the party took 36 seats from the SNP. Sir Keir retooled a familiar phrase in his address to new Scottish MPs and other supporters in a hotel looking out over Edinburgh Castle. ""We won because we campaigned as changed Labour,"" he said, adding: ""And we will govern as changed Labour."" It was an obvious reference to Sir Tony, who entered Downing Street 27 years ago with the words: ""We ran for office as New Labour, we will govern as New Labour. "" But this is not 1997.  Starmer has inherited a stagnating economy, with low growth, low productivity and high inequality. He is dealing with the fallout from Covid, the war in Ukraine and Conservative cuts to public spending in response to the financial crisis of 2007/8, known as austerity. Winning control of the Scottish government from the SNP at Holyrood in 2026 could yet depend on Labour delivering the change it has promised voters as quickly as possible. That will be a huge challenge when the party has pledged to stick to Conservative spending plans, a point the SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney made repeatedly during the election campaign. Yesterday, though, both men were stressing co-operation. Mr Swinney told broadcasters that, on eradicating child poverty, improving public services and tackling climate change, “there is common ground to be achieved by working collaboratively with the United Kingdom government.” Sir Keir also sounded positive, focusing on Scotland's only oil refinery at Grangemouth, where hundreds of jobs are under threat. “We discussed the economy. We discussed energy and as you would expect, we discussed Grangemouth,” he said, promising that “our governments will work together on that issue straight away.” More generally, says new Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the way to reinvigorate the economy is growth aligned with an industrial strategy which will include a new publicly-owned green energy company based in Scotland. However, there is still confusion about whether the proposed ""Great British Energy"" would operate as an actual energy generation company, as Labour originally promised or, as Sir Keir later told BBC Radio Scotland, ""an investment vehicle."" Regardless, trade unions, which have traditionally supported Labour, are worried about the impact on North Sea jobs of an accelerated transition to renewable power. That is not their only concern. ""We haven't got time to wait for growth,"" said Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""People are literally hurting out there, and we're going to have to borrow to invest, and our crumbling public services need money."" The other big economic issue hanging over Sir Keir as he takes office is the UK's decision – against Scotland’s wishes – to end free trading arrangements with its biggest market, the European Union. As he spoke to journalists on a terrace overlooking Edinburgh Castle on Sunday, I asked the prime minister if he had anything practical to say about how he would address the impact of Brexit, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates will reduce UK productivity (output per worker) by 4% in the long term. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""We intend to improve our relationship with the EU and that means closer trading ties with the EU. ""It means closer ties in relation to research and development and closer ties in relation to defence and security. ""I do think that we can get a much better deal than the botched deal that Boris Johnson saddled the UK with,"" Sir Keir added. Could that mean a return to some form of free-trading arrangement with the EU? ""I think we're going to have a much better deal than the one we've got now. That depends on respectful relationships, talking to leaders across the EU and, of course, that work has already begun,"" he replied. There are plenty of other challenges for Sir Keir. He arrived for and left his meeting with Mr Swinney at the first minister’s official residence in Edinburgh by the back door amid noisy pro-Gaza protests outside the building. The pair could clearly hear the chanting as they chatted inside the building. Outside, one of the protestors, who didn't want to give her name in case it caused trouble with her employer, told me she was unimpressed by the prime minister's decision not to go in the front door of the building. ""I think it's ridiculous but laughable at the same time,"" she said, adding: ""Back door Starmer. He can't face the people. He's meant to be Labour, one of the people, and he can't face us."" Downing Street said they would not comment on the prime minister’s logistics. Sir Keir will hope the rest of his trip around the UK, indeed the rest of his premiership, goes a little more smoothly."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93n7lgw5qo,'Protectionism eroding global business' - world trade chief,The boss of the World Trade Organization warns the global economy is facing numerous challenges.,8 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:45.763012,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Global trade “is not having the best of times at the moment”. That is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “We are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,” she tells the BBC. “Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.” In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Both Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West. President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips. Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports. EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. “We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,” he says. Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year. However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech. “What we've seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we've seen since the end of the Cold War.""  “The last few years, you've had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,” she said. That’s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis. “We're also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. “We're seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.” She warns that “it will be costly for the world” to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (£5.8tn) of lost output in the long run. The EU’s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU. BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help. After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.” When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it’s “mind boggling” that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China’s economy has been growing steadily. Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: “I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.” The chamber’s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China. It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to “de-risk not de-couple” its relations with China. Brussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine. Companies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China. Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars. However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world. This year Panama Canal officials had to reduce the number of ships allowed to traverse the waterway. This is due to a lack of rainfall to fill the lake that feeds the canal. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal is effectively cut off because of ongoing attacks on commercial ships by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Traffic through the canal is down 90%, according to logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel. Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd, says this disruption means that the rates his firm charges are up between 30% and 40%. Whilst shipping costs are a small part of retail prices, Mr Habben Jansen says “these extra costs in the end get passed on” to consumers. That could end up pushing inflation up just as central banks are showing signs of getting it under control. That would be “detrimental to consumers,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. Despite all the tensions, she says trade has shown signs of resilience, and she adds that her organization can help countries solve their differences. Meanwhile, Dr Okonjo-Iweala admits that some WTO rules will need to change to help meet the challenge of climate change.  “I strongly believe that some of our [global trade] rules, we do need to look at them,"" she says. “When they were put in place, decades ago, we were not confronting the kind of climate change threats we confront today.” Regarding the increased use of tariffs, she adds: “We hope we don't have a repeat of what we saw in the 1930s. We had retaliatory tariffs, and it was downhill from there and everyone lost. “So I do hope we will not enter into that kind of era again”. "

The Rotary Club of Northampton Becket plans to load the equipment onto a second-hand ambulance, which will be driven to the Ukrainian border next month. The club has also appealed for warm clothing for all ages, as the forthcoming winter season in the country will see temperatures drop well below freezing. One of the drivers said the handover point for the ambulance would be ""a long way from the fighting and bombing"". During its weekly meetings at the Overstone Golf Club near Northampton, one of the town's five Rotary clubs discussed plans to get an ambulance into Ukraine filled with rehabilitation equipment and clothing. David Smith, one of the drivers who will be making the trip, said: ""This is a humanitarian mission. ""We've bought a second-hand ambulance from a dealer in Birmingham. They pick up loads of ambulances that the NHS have finished with - they're still mechanically sound and the condition of the bodywork doesn't matter."" The ambulance has been stripped of its equipment, although the club will retain a stretcher.  Mr Smith said he had bought  stretcher brakes online which ""clamp into the floor to stop the patient flying off as you pull away"". There will be plenty of space in the back for mechanical aids, so the club has appealed for donations of wheelchairs, crutches and walking frames.  They have also appealed for winter clothing suitable for any age which will become essential when temperatures start to drop. The club has worked with Rotarians in Ukraine to organise a handover on the Ukrainian side of the border with Poland. Mr Smith said the handover would take place ""a long way from all the fighting and the bombing so we should be fairly safe"", although he admits to saying it is ""very safe"" when his wife is listening.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml29r8d2zxo,Hungary's Russia-friendly PM meets Putin in Moscow,"Viktor Orban's self-styled ""peace mission"" was heavily criticised by EU leaders and by Ukraine.",5 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:45.962555,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, in a visit that has been heavily criticised by EU leaders and Ukraine's government.  Friday's meeting was part of what Mr Orban called a ""peace mission"", coming three days  after a visit to Kyiv where he met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hungary has just taken over the presidency of the Council of the European Union, but EU leaders have stressed that Mr Orban is not acting on behalf of the bloc.  Mr Orban is the EU's only head of government to have kept close ties to the Kremlin following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After the meeting, which lasted several hours, Hungary's PM said Russia and Ukraine were still ""far apart"" in their views on achieving peace.  ""Many steps are needed to end the war, but we took the first step to restore dialogue,"" he said.  The Russian leader called it a ""frank and useful"" conversation. He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy. Volodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Earlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting ""not just as a long-time partner"" but as a European Union representative.  However, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU.  ""The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU,"" Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X.  ""The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine."" ""Appeasement will not stop Putin,"" European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. Ukraine also condemned the visit: ""For our country, the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all states to strictly adhere to it,"" the foreign ministry said a statement.  Earlier this week, Mr Orban visited Kyiv, saying ""a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations"". President Zelensky - who has had frosty relations with Mr Orban - did not publicly respond to the proposal.  Ahead of Ukraine’s offensive last summer, Mr Orban warned that Ukraine cannot win on the battlefield.  Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Hungarian prime minister has underlined that Russia’s advantage in resources and men makes Putin’s country unbeatable.  However, many Ukrainians believe any ceasefire would simply cement Russia’s hold over territory it has seized from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot. Mr Orban has been a vocal critic of Western support for Ukraine. He previously slowed agreement on a €50bn ($54bn; £42bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia. Tuesday's visit to Kyiv was his first in 12 years, while he met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time. During Mr Orban's joint appearance with Mr Zelensky, the body language between them was not warm, and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements. But for the next six months Mr Orban's position as head of the Council of the European Union means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe.  His visit to Kyiv came on his second day in that role, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future."

Muir, 31, ran three minutes 53.79 seconds for third place to improve the national record she set in winning Olympic silver in Tokyo three years ago. Kenyan Kipyegon clocked a sensational 3:49.04 to claim victory ahead of Australian Jessica Hull as the 30-year-old now eyes a third successive Olympic title in the French capital next month. British champion Georgia Bell clocked a huge personal best of 3:56.54 for fifth as she builds towards her Games debut, while Katie Snowden was ninth in 3:58.13.

Briton Morgan Lake finished ninth with a leap over 1.92m. Elizabeth Bird ran a season's best 9:09.07 to take third in the women's 3,000m steeplechase, won by Bahrain's world champion Winfred Yavi in 9:03.68.

Monaco hosts the ninth event in the series on Friday, before athletes have a final opportunity to fine-tune their preparations in London on Saturday, 20 July. Elsewhere on Sunday, Keely Hodgkinson took victory in the women's 800m at the FBK Games in the Netherlands in 1:57.36, while Melissa Courtney-Bryant won the 1500m in 4:03.58.

Only Hull dared follow as Kipyegon raced the pace-setting lights on the inside of the track in pursuit of further history, while Muir timed her effort perfectly to finish strong and boost her belief she can once again make the Olympic podium. ""To run a British record in the city where the Olympics will be in less than a monthâs time is pretty exciting, so Iâm very, very happy,"" Muir said. ""I think it will give me a lot of confidence going into the Games. To win an Olympic medal now will be so, so hard but it would be an amazing achievement - so Iâm just going to go out there and give it my all."" Mahuchikh won bronze on her Olympic debut as a teenager in Tokyo three years ago and will head to Paris as the one to beat after her historic jump. The Ukrainian had recorded the joint-fourth highest jump in history with a personal best leap over 2.07m, after she secured victory over Australian Nicola Olyslagers by clearing 2.03m. Maintaining that momentum, Mahuchikh, who two years ago was forced to flee her war-torn home country following Russia's invasion, raced away to celebrate with her coach after taking down the world record at the first attempt. ""Coming into this competition, I had feelings that I could jump 2.07m and maybe 2.10m,"" she said. ""Finally I signed Ukraine to the history of world athletics."" Armand Duplantis was unable to make it a trio of world records in Paris but still took victory in the men's pole vault. The Swede broke the world record for an eighth time at the opening Diamond League of the season in April and has gone close to improving that mark of 6.24m on several occasions, most recently at the European Championships. Winner of back-to-back world golds since becoming Olympic champion at the age of 21 in Tokyo three years ago, Duplantis sealed victory with a clearance at 6.00m.

The firm said in its annual report new tariff increases would also help meet the costs of maintaining its infrastructure so energy supplies were ""secure and reliable"". According to its accounts, GEL has more than £29m of bank loans, as well as other debts, that expose it to ""higher debt financing costs"" and ""inflationary pressures"". Peter Shaefer, the firm's chairman, said ""significant"" investment was needed and ""further tariff increases will be necessary"". The warning comes after electricity bills rose 10% at the start of this month, having risen 13% in 2023, which the company blamed on under-investment and ""artificially low"" prices in the past. GEL said net debt had increased by £4.5m last year because of nearly £13m in additional spending. It said this was a ""cause for concern"" and it needed to ""move to a more sustainable financing model"". The company said a long-standing agreement with France to supply electricity at a fixed cost had nearly halved the price of electricity for people in Guernsey over recent years. It said pressures such as the war in Ukraine had forced prices up in the UK and elsewhere, but Guernsey had been protected from this by the agreement with France. However, it said the wholesale cost of electricity would rise as that agreement had come to an end. Alan Bates, GEL's chief executive, said customers' bills had been ""amongst the lowest in the British Isles"" and the firm performed well compared to Jersey and the Isle of Man, according to a recent review. Mr Bates said prices would rise so it could start to repay its current high-cost debts, as well as to decarbonise the island and maintain old infrastructure. Mr Bates said the company was planning to fund its infrastructure investments ""in the most affordable and cost-efficient way"" with a mixture of long-term borrowing and reinvesting profits. He said the firm was ""mindful"" of the ""cost of living pressures on all consumers and remains committed to operating in an efficient manner to minimise costs wherever possible"". Speaking about renewable energy, Mr Bates said only 0.2% of the island's electricity supply came from solar power. He said about 90% of the island's energy came from the underwater cable to France. ""Recognising our island's unique challenges, and understanding the importance of using a blend of imported electricity and local renewables, will ensure the island has a secure and resilient supply as we transition towards new energy sources and our net carbon zero targets by 2050,"" he said.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3q3zre9zo,Sunak's 'dismal end' and 'bland' Starmer: World media reacts to UK election,Labour's landslide victory has been followed closely by media commentators around the world.,5 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:46.235249,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"By BBC Monitoring and Matthew Davis The Conservatives have emerged with ""broken bones"" from the UK election after Rishi Sunak's ""dismal end"" - but the big question for some in the international media is whether the ""bland, even boring"" Keir Starmer can clean up the UK's ""mess"". Labour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time.  For Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean ""the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders"", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile. Voters ""were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,"" the paper says, adding that ""Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party"". German business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result ""opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit"". ""Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,"" the paper said. Mr Farage’s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an “election earthquake”, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives. French media largely hails Labour’s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader’s success in Clacton, ""the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader"". According to Le Monde, the UK’s return to the centre-left is ""striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections"". Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: ""The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced."" Conservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer “a reassuring institutional alternative”. But for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as “a bit bland, even boring”. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, “previous leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results”. In Hungary, the press there noted two issues: “Unchanged support for Ukraine”, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for “a more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,” said the left-wing paper Telex.  The New York Times casts Labour's victory as ""a seismic moment in the UK’s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s"". But it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots. ""The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters’ faith in mainstream politics,"" the Times says. For ABC News, Rishi Sunak’s campaign to remain Britain’s prime minister showed a lack of political touch. ""Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters."" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May — ""with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,"" the broadcaster said. Meanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: ""The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos."" ""Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,"" the paper said. By Rupsha Mukherjee  Most TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat.  “British Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,” The Times of India noted. The Wire website called it ""a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government"". Everything Sunak tried during the campaign “really failed”, Times Now TV added. “Everyone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat."" But the Labour win “is also a triumph for India”, one news site thought, suggesting that Sir Keir Starmer would seek better relations with Delhi. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring China team China’s only official statement so far has been via its foreign ministry, which said China “had noticed the results of the British election” and “we hope to get Sino-UK relations along the right track”. Despite these hopes, state media outlets were not overly optimistic.  “With six prime ministers in eight years, can Starmer clean up the UK’s mess?” asked broadcaster CCTV. Given the next government faces “the most challenging issues in 70 years”,  “public dissatisfaction” might soon follow, mused The Paper.  The Global Times, however, published a positive profile of the prime minister-to-be, saying Sir Keir was “not the inflammatory politician that people imagine”, and that media impressions of him are that he is “conscientious, good at management, and a little dull”.  China can hope for a more pragmatic relationship with the UK, the paper said. By Anastasia Bazenkova and Yuriy Martynenko Russia’s state-controlled TV channels have presented the UK election result as a “miserable failure” and a ""crushing defeat"" for the Conservative party and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. State channel Rossiya 1 said that Brexit was the only achievement of 14 years of Conservative rule and Channel One objected to how Russia had been cast in the election in the UK, which has helped rally Western opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.  “This election, like politics in general in Britain in recent years, just can’t manage without an enemy figure in the form of Russia,"" the channel said. Outlets and commentators in both Russia and Ukraine don't expect the election to change UK policies toward Russia. “For Moscow [Keir Starmer's] arrival in power changes nothing, since he takes anti-Russian positions and supports continued backing for Ukraine,” said NTV, another leading Russian channel.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,Russia is throwing wave after wave of men forward in Ukraine to make ground. The tactic is working.,4 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:46.325041,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen"

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng03lnv0vo,The far right came close to power in France. What about the rest of Europe?,"Whatever the result of France's election, its impact will be seismic, says Europe editor Katya Adler.",7 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:49.972917,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"How likely is France to wake up on Monday morning to a new far-right dawn? That was the garishly painted, hotly debated scenario in media headlines, the EU in Brussels and seats of government across Europe following the first round of France’s parliamentary vote. But despite the spectacular showing by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party last week, the RN has failed to achieve a majority. French centrist and leftist parties strategically withdrew candidates to bolster each other’s contenders ahead of Sunday’s decisive second round. But the impact of this election will be seismic, as the RN is still expected to greatly increase its representation in parliament. That means a decades-old taboo will have been shattered in France, a core EU nation. The EU was born out of the ashes of World War Two. It was originally designed as a peace project, with wartime enemies, France and Germany, at its core. Far-right parties were banished to the outer fringes of European politics. Last month, world leaders gathered in northern France to mark 80 years since D-Day, the allied amphibious assault in Normandy that helped secure the defeat of Nazi Germany. But now, “far-right” or “hard-right” or “populist nationalist” parties are part of coalition governments in a number of EU countries, including the Netherlands, Italy and Finland. There are challenges in labelling these parties. Their policies frequently change. They also vary from country to country. And their normalisation is not an entirely new phenomenon. Former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, a centre-right politician, was the first EU leader to take the plunge. He formed a government with the post-fascist political group, Movimento Sociale Italiano, back in 1994. Six years later, Austria’s conservatives went into coalition with the far-right Freedom Party. At the time, the EU was so outraged that it blocked official bilateral contacts with Austria for several months. Post-war political etiquette dictated the political mainstream must form a cordon sanitaire, a “health barrier”, at election time to keep the extreme right out of European governments. The universally recognised term for that practice is French, which gives you a sense how passionately many in France felt about it. In the 2002 Presidential election, some French voters clipped a clothes peg to their noses on their way to polling stations - a way of showing they’d vote for a candidate they didn’t really like, just  to keep out the far right. This was a far right that for years was led by Marine Le Pen’s father, with French former members of a Nazi-led Waffen SS unit in his party ranks. Fast-forward to 2024, and Marine Le Pen’s ambition, 10 years in the making, to detoxify her father’s party – changing its name and trying hard to clean up its image - appears to have been a roaring success. The cordon sanitaire now has a searing gash in it, after the leader of France’s centre-right Les Républicains struck a deal with the RN not to compete against each other this Sunday in specific constituencies. This was an earthquake in French politics. Crucially for Marine Le Pen, those who support her aren’t embarrassed to admit it any more. The RN is no longer viewed as an extremist protest movement. For many, it offers a credible political programme, whatever its detractors claim. French voters trust the RN more than any other party to manage their economy and (currently poor) public finances, according to an Ipsos poll for the Financial Times newspaper. This is despite the party’s lack of government experience and its largely unfunded tax-cutting and spending plans. Which begs the question, when you observe the angst-ridden despair in liberal circles in Europe at the growing success of the so-called “New Right”: if traditional lawmakers had served their electorates better, perhaps there’d be less of an opening for European populists to walk into? By populists, I mean politicians like Ms Le Pen who claim to listen to and speak on behalf of “ordinary people”, defending them against “the establishment”. This “them and us” argument is extremely effective when voters feel anxious and ignored by governing powers. Just look at Donald Trump in the US, the sudden unexpected breakthrough of Reform UK in Thursday’s UK election and the huge success of Germany’s controversial anti-migration AfD party. In France, many perceive President Macron - a former merchant banker - as arrogant, privileged and remote from the everyday cares of ordinary people outside the Paris bubble. A man who made difficult lives even tougher, they say, by raising the national pension age and trying to put up fuel prices, citing environmental concerns. It must be a source of frustration for France’s president that his success at lowering unemployment rates and the billions of euros he spent trying to soften the economic effects of the Covid and energy crises seem largely forgotten. Meanwhile, the RN concentrated much of its campaign on the cost-of-living crisis. The party has pledged to cut taxes on gas and electricity and to raise the minimum wage for low earners. Priorities like these mean the RN should no longer be labelled a far-right movement, its supporters insist. They point to a widening support base and say the party shouldn’t be forever tarnished by its racist roots under Le Pen senior. A similar argument echoes out of Rome. Italy’s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, once used to praise fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Her Brothers of Italy party has post-fascist roots but she now heads one of the EU’s most stable governments. She recently censured a meeting of her party’s youth wing. Members had been filmed giving fascist salutes. There was no room in her party for nostalgia for the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century, she said. While critics at home warn of attempts to influence Italy’s media landscape and Ms Meloni’s attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, her concrete proposals to tackle irregular migration have won plaudits from the European mainstream, including the EU Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, and the UK’s recently ousted prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Frankly, on hot-button issues like migration, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the political rhetoric of the far right in Europe and traditional mainstream politicians intentionally sharpening their speeches to try to hold on to voters. Former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was a prime example of this, and Emmanuel Macron too, the more he’s felt the heat of Marine Le Pen’s popularity. One of the inadvertent effects of mainstream politicians aping parties further to their right on migration is that it makes the original anti-immigration parties seem more respectable, acceptable and electable.  Witness the recent stellar performance in the Netherlands’ general election of anti-migration politician Geert Wilders, who has been regularly accused of hate speech. The label “far right” is one that needs to be debated. Much depends on the make-up of each party. But the kind of acceptance now enjoyed by Ms Meloni in wider international circles is still a remote dream for Ms Le Pen. The most likely outcome in France is a paralysed hung parliament or an unruly coalition government of non-Le Pen parties. Any and all of these scenarios reduce Emmanuel Macron to a pretty lame-duck president. Political instability at home means big EU powers, France and also Germany, are turning inwards at a time of great global uncertainty. Wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine. EU and Nato-sceptic Donald Trump is poised to possibly return to the White House. It’s a precarious moment for Europe to be without leadership. Voters feel exposed. Even if not this Sunday, Marine Le Pen’s followers firmly believe their time is coming. Soon.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce78nr3253jo,Five killed by Russian strike in central Ukraine,"A further 53 people are injured, after blasts rocked the city of Dnipro early on Wednesday morning.",3 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:50.080497,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"At least five people have been killed by a Russian drone and missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, officials say.  A further 53 people were injured in the blast early on Wednesday morning, regional head Serhii Lysak wrote on Telegram. Officials said shops, schools and hospitals were damaged by the strike.  Mr Lysak described the attack as ""vicious"". Footage shared on social media showed a large plume of smoke and fire erupting from buildings after the blast.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack and renewed his appeal to Western allies to supply his government with further air defence systems.  ""Only two things can stop this Russian terror – modern air defence systems and the long-range capabilities of our weapons,"" he wrote on social media.  Dnipro, a city with a pre-war population of about a million people, has been a frequent target for Russian attacks since the war began over two years ago. Last year, 40 people were killed after a Russian missile slammed into a residential  apartment building in the city.  Ukraine's air force said it downed six drones and five out of seven missiles which had targeted the city early on Wednesday.  But images posted by Mr Lysak after the barrage showed buildings ripped open in the city centre, with glass shattered and strewn across the ground.  Georgii, an elderly witness sporting a bandaged nose and bloodied face, told the Reuters news agency: ""There was such a strong explosion that the wave hit me and I fell.""  Among the injured was a 14-year-old girl, Mr Lysak said. Four other people in serious conditions were being treated at hospital, he added.  The head of the regional council, Mykola Lukashuk, condemned what he called an act of ""cynical terror"" by Russian forces. An official day of mourning has been declared by city officials.  Elsewhere, two civilians were killed in overnight strikes in eastern Ukraine, officials in Donetsk and Luhansk have said. In Kharkiv, one person was killed and eight more injured - including an eight-year-old boy - in a Russian bombing raid, local prosecutors said.  Russia has intensified its aerial attacks on Ukraine in recent months. While Moscow denies targeting civilian infrastructure, the UN's human rights monitoring mission said May was the deadliest month for civilian casualties in almost a year. President Zelensky has issued increasingly urgent requests for new air defence systems in that time, urging his allies in the West to ignore Russian threats that such actions could trigger an escalation of tensions.  On Tuesday, he met Hungary's Prime Minister, Victor Orban, who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Mr Orban has long been Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has frequently criticised EU aid packages for Ukraine. The men's body language was not warm during the tense meeting in Kyiv, with Mr Orban urging Mr Zelensky to seek a ceasefire and expedited peace negotiations.  Elsewhere, Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that it had captured a key district in the hilltop settlement of Chasiv Yar. The small town in eastern Ukraine has been at the centre of intense fighting for months.  The town, which has been flattened by endless shelling, is viewed as a potential staging ground for Russian forces as they advance on the remaining Ukrainian-held areas in the Donetsk region.  Kyiv has yet to comment on the claims.  Meanwhile, Ukraine's military intelligence agency has said it was behind a fire which broke out on a Russian warship in the Baltic Sea in April.  GUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov told Reuters that the agency had targeted the Serpukhov missile ship, operating in tandem with a pro-Kyiv group called the Freedom of Russia legion.  ""As a result of the sabotage, [we] managed to ruin the ship from inside and completely destroy communication and its means of automation,"" the legion said on its Telegram account. It comes as Moscow claimed Ukraine carried out three drone strikes on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday. The plant's Russian management said several workers were injured in the attack.  The UN's nuclear watchdog - the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - called the attacks a ""a threat to nuclear safety and people’s lives"", adding that they ""must stop"".  Kyiv has yet to comment on the accusations. The plant has been under Russian control since March 2022 and has come under frequent attacks, with both sides trading blame. "

Sir Michael failed to be re-elected as MP for Lichfield where he had been an MP since 1992, losing to Labour's Dave Robertson by 810 votes. In an interview after his tenure as an MP ended, Fabricant said party infighting and a quick succession of prime ministers over the last few years had not inspired confidence with the electorate. ""I'm obviously disappointed but I suspected it might happen,"" the 74-year-old told the BBC. ""Firstly, there were huge national swings [that] worked against Conservative candidates. I mean, I don't want to make excuses, but I will."" Sir Michael lost a 30% share in the vote compared to 2019 when he won with a majority of more than 22,000. He claimed tactical voting was another reason for his loss, citing the performance of Reform UK during the election. Overall, his party suffered a huge general election defeat - the worst in its parliamentary history ""All governments in power are unpopular because of the cost of fuel and inflation and everything caused by the money spent on Covid, furlough, and also because of the war in Ukraine,"" he added. ""Of course the Conservative Party hasn't helped itself by constantly fighting amongst itself over the last few years, and the succession of prime ministers didn't inspire confidence with the electorate, so I understand why they felt that way.  ""So I like to think it's not a personal referendum on my performance as an MP but rather the failure I think of the last few years of the Conservative government."" However the former MP was gracious in defeat, calling Dave Robertson a ""decent guy"" who he was sure would do his best to represent the constituency. ""Because I want him to do well, for the people of the constituency who've elected me all over these years, I wish him well,"" Sir Michael said. Sir Michael was MP for the area since 1992 when he represented Mid Staffordshire before it was abolished under a boundary review and he became the MP for Lichfield in 1997. Known for his trademark blond locks, the subject of much speculation, as an MP he was known for his colourful personality and fondness for eye-catching stunts. They included once filming himself cycling naked around a park in London, to promote the creation of a charity naked bike ride in Lichfield. In 2022, he apologised for suggesting teachers and nurses enjoyed a ""quiet drink"" in staff rooms during lockdown. Sir Michael made the comment during a BBC interview where he said he did not believe then prime minister Boris Johnson knew he was breaking the law when he attended a gathering in Downing Street in June 2020 to celebrate his 56th birthday. He was given a knighthood in the former prime minister's resignation honours list. Reflecting on the highlights of his career, Sir Michael said he was proud to have helped save the National Memorial Arboretum when it had financial difficulties. He recounted, while he was in opposition, persuading a Labour minister to write off a huge debt in VAT which he said would have bankrupted them. Sir Michael also said he was proud to have persuaded the RAF to take on a young female constituent whose father had a hereditary disease. Despite having lost his seat, he said he would not be leaving the area: ""I hope Lichfield people will remember me with affection."" Looking to the future, the former MP added: ""Someone has suggested I do Strictly Come Dancing but I'm not too sure!"" Follow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

They travelled back to Ukraine in December 2022 to find Mrs Brazhnyk's sister, and be reunited with the children's father. But as bombings increased this year, Mrs  Brazhnyk made the difficult decision to return to the UK to keep her sons safe.  Maks said their last six months in Ukraine ""was very difficult"", with ""lots of bombing"". He added: ""It was quite loud, sometimes we couldn't sleep - there was no hot water or light sometimes.""

Serhii quickly found a place at a local primary school, but there were waiting lists for both of the closest secondary schools for Maks. Luckily, one space become available, so he has started school again this week. To find a home, Ms Kinch said her family had to ""act as guarantor so the landlord would rent to them"". Ms Kinch believes people are not as aware of the war in Ukraine as much as they used to be.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g37mk7vxlo,Are deep shifts in Muslim and Jewish voting here to stay?,"In the 2024 UK general election, Labour suffered some surprise seat losses over its stance on Gaza.",7 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:50.467646,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"However big the headline change in the vote between the past two elections, drill down into two demographic pockets of Britain and you find staggering shifts. It all centres around the relationships between the Labour Party and not just Muslim voters, but Jewish voters too. It leaves a party in government that has made progress in winning back trust among people from one faith group while suddenly finding itself with a lot of work to do to win back many members of the other. The drop in the Labour vote share among British Muslims between 2019 and 2024 very obviously played out in several constituencies. This happened most dramatically in Leicester South, with a Muslim population close to 30%, where Shadow Paymaster General Jon Ashworth lost his seat to independent Shockat Adam. In the seat of Dewsbury and Batley, in Birmingham Perry Barr and in Blackburn, there were wins for independents in what had been safe Labour seats with large numbers of Muslim voters. In places like Bradford West and the seat of Bethnal Green and Stepney in east London, sitting Labour MPs clung on with startling reductions in their majorities. Mish Rahman, from Walsall, is not just any Muslim voter. He currently sits on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, a body of fewer than 40 members. He is furious with the party’s response to the killing of tens of thousands of people in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there. “In my community it has got to the point where I am now embarrassed about my affiliation with Labour,” he says. “It was hard even to tell members of my own extended family to go and knock on doors to tell people to vote for a party that originally gave Israel carte blanche in its response to the horrific 7 October attacks,” says Mr Rahman. He lays the blame for the decline in Muslim voting for Labour squarely at the door of the Labour leader. Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by many in his party, including councillors, for an interview with LBC in October in which he suggested that Israel “had the right” to withhold power and water in Gaza. His spokesman subsequently suggested the Labour leader had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. Then when Labour MPs were told by the party leadership in November to abstain from voting on an SNP-led motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, some Labour councillors resigned and, for many Muslims, trust in their Labour MP was lost. Faith communities are far from homogenous, of course. There are myriad factors that govern how a person will cast their vote, but faith does throw up a unique set of considerations that plays out in broad voting patterns. Muslims are estimated to form around 6.5% of the population of England and Wales, with around 2% in Scotland and 1% in Northern Ireland. Well over 80% of Muslims are believed to have voted for Labour in 2019. Research just ahead of the 2024 election suggested that had dropped nationally by up to 20 percentage points, and in some constituencies the Muslim vote for Labour clearly fell further. The contrast with Jewish voting data could not be more stark. In 2019, the proportion of British Jews (about 0.5% of the population) who voted for a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is thought to have collapsed to just single figures. Research suggests that figure could have climbed back to above 40%. “What we have seen is a huge bounce-back for Labour among Jewish voters,” says Adam Langleben, who was until recently the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement. Mr Langleben, a former Labour councillor and now director of Progressive Britain (formerly Progress), points to Labour wins in London in the Finchley and Golders Green seat and also Hendon as well as Bury South in Greater Manchester, all constituencies with large Jewish populations. “Jewish voters returning to the party has undoubtedly delivered seats to the Labour Party,” says Mr Langleben. “You don’t need a majority of Jewish voters to win in these constituencies, but you also can’t only have 7% of them voting for you and expect to win,” he says. Mr Langleben had been a senior member of the Jewish Labour Movement but was one of many Jewish members of the party to give up their membership during the Corbyn era. When he left in 2019, he said it was on account of the party being “led by antisemites”, an accusation always strongly denied by those leading the party at the time. “It was a situation that was all-consuming. I would be canvassing for the Labour Party in a Jewish area and had people in tears on the doorstep saying there was no way they could vote for Jeremy Corbyn, and I was trying to juggle this huge personal tension,” he says. Mr Langleben puts Mr Corbyn’s problems down to both a lack of personal reflection about who he was associating with, and what he says was the party’s inability to deal with extreme elements in its base and tolerance of the use of antisemitic tropes. “From day one, Keir Starmer pledged to work with the Jewish community to try to deal with the issues inside the Labour Party. For him, fixing what went wrong was a personal mission,” he says. But given that Keir Starmer supported Jeremy Corbyn throughout his leadership, Jewish voters at hustings in synagogues and community centres around the country had been grilling Labour candidates as to why they should trust the current leader now. “The Jewish vote is now split and that’s how it should be. The results show there wasn’t a dominant party of choice, and that’s healthy, and still represents a huge transformation for Labour,” says Mr Langleben. So while mistrust clearly still remains, what is responsible for the transformation in the perception of the Labour Party among some British Jews? The fact that the current leadership’s criticism of Israel’s response to the 7 October attacks has been more tempered than it may have been under the previous leadership may have contributed. But long before that, Mr Langleben cites a change in the way complaints around “protected characteristics” like faith are dealt with by the party, but also refers to one thing that convinced him he was right to re-join the party. “The fundamental moment was Jeremy Corbyn being suspended from the Labour Party and then subsequently having the whip removed, because it showed Keir Starmer’s determination and his willingness to take on parts of the party that previously he had not been willing to take on,” he says. Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension is precisely identified by Mr Rahman too as the first major showdown between different wings of the party under Keir Starmer. Except, as someone who had been inspired by Mr Corbyn from the days of Stop the War protests in the lead-up to the UK-backed invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr Rahman was on the other side, saying that was the moment when the alarm bells started ringing for him that the party leaders were not safeguarding the values he believed in. Mr Rahman does not see the party’s anti-Muslim slant as being limited to its response to events in Gaza. He does not question there have been serious cases of antisemitism but does not believe all accusations of racism are treated equally. “There is a clear hierarchy of racism in the Labour Party. Some instances of racism, including Islamophobia, aren't taken as seriously as they should,” he says. Mr Rahman cites the case of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the EHRC, who was suspended for alleged Islamophobia. Mr Phillips had said British Muslims were “a nation within a nation” and previously that their opinion was “some distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else’s”, though later he suggested this had not necessarily been meant as a criticism. Mr Phillips was readmitted to the party in 2021 without it going to a panel inquiry. Mr Rahman, like many other Muslims, also points to Keir Starmer’s own comments, like those made in a Sun livestream during the election campaign, when he talked of migrants being sent back to the countries they came from. “At the moment, people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed because they’re not being processed,” the Labour leader said. “Can you imagine the Labour Party saying that about people of any other ethnicity? Saying they're going to deport people to Israel or Ukraine or Hong Kong? It wouldn’t happen and neither should it,” says Mr Rahman. Such is his disenchantment with Labour’s response that, coupled with wider concerns regarding the treatment of Muslims, he lays a serious charge against the party. “I don’t doubt for a minute that Labour is currently institutionally Islamophobic,” says Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman wants to use his voice to call out hypocrisy in the party while in government, in the hope that it will learn what he says is a lesson of this election - that no voter can be taken for granted. Mr Rahman did give up his membership of the Labour Party once before, in protest at Tony Blair’s role in the Iraq War. He, and other Muslims, felt persuaded to come back to the party in 2014 when the then-leader Ed Miliband condemned the scale of an Israeli operation in Gaza and the hundreds of civilian deaths. Once again, at the same moment, Mr Langleben was seeing things very differently on the doorsteps of Jewish voters. Even though Mr Miliband was himself Jewish, it was a time when polls were showing a rapid decline in Jewish support for Labour, particularly when the party’s 2015 manifesto talked about a parliamentary vote to recognise a Palestinian state. “There were sometimes quite horrible conversations with Jewish voters who really cared about the issue of Israel,” says Mr Langleben. “People in 2015 were accusing the Labour Party of antisemitism, but I think it fundamentally misread what antisemitism is. Then, it was a primarily about a foreign policy issue, Israel. That changed by 2019 when conversations were around a particular strain of far-left anti-Jewish racism,” says Mr Langleben. For some of those supportive of the Corbyn-era leadership, that sense that criticism of Israel was being conflated with antisemitism was also something they felt occurred while he was leader. The Hamas attacks of the 7 October 2023 happened during the week of the Labour Party conference and Mr Langleben says it was strange to see normal political business go on while he and other Jewish delegates were going through a difficult and upsetting period. Ultimately, Mr Langleben says he has been pleased with the way Keir Starmer has handled the crisis, seeing it as Labour realigning itself with UK and US government policy on Israel. This is precisely why during this election campaign, Mr Rahman had the hardest conversations on the doorsteps of Muslim voters he had ever had, with anger and frustration boiling over about Israel’s actions in Gaza. “If you look back at the history of the relationship between our communities and the Labour Party, it's always been a one-sided affair of loyalty from our communities,” Mr Rahman says. The Labour Party’s roots in his own family go back to his grandfather, who was a factory worker in the 1950s and 60s. Mr Rahman talks of feeling “betrayed”. Gaza of course is not just a Muslim issue, and not all Muslims ranked it is one of the key considerations on which they voted, but it had an impact. Similarly, Israel policy is not necessarily a major consideration for all Jewish voters, and even for those for whom it is, there are those who are highly critical of the Israeli government and are at odds with the response of Labour under Starmer. But while over the decades the Jewish vote has swung between the two main parties broadly in line with the general population, it would appear that if one puts to one side all of the rows over antisemitism, the party’s outlook on Israel does impact voting intention. Separately, both Mish Rahman and Adam Langleben are very clear that their accusations of discrimination levelled at the party in different eras do not just relate to party policy on the Middle East. Even if everyone can be satisfied that accusations of discrimination are dealt with equally, such are the modern tensions around Middle East policy that political parties may struggle to find a position that does not alienate some members of one of these faith communities. Labour has achieved much in winning back the levels of Jewish voters it has, but it has also left huge swathes of loyal Muslim voters in Britain feeling politically adrift, and large swings in culture and policy over recent years leave many in each community needing convincing of the true nature of the party.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gvrzpwp54o,Hungary's Orban urges ceasefire on Kyiv visit,"A critic of Western support for Ukraine, he is seen as the European leader closest to Russia's Vladimir Putin.",3 Jul 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:50.554513,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Viktor Orban arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for an unannounced visit having just taken over as rotating president of the European Union. While in Kyiv, the Hungarian prime minister said a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine could speed up negotiations to end the war that followed Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Mr Orban has been a critic of Western support for Ukraine and is seen as the European leader closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin. This was his first visit to Ukraine in 12 years, although he has met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time. During his joint appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the body language between them was not warm and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements. Mr Orban previously slowed agreement on a €50bn ($54bn; £42bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia.  But for the next six months his position as head of the European Council means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe. He came to Ukraine on his second day in that role for discussions, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future. In his statement following their meeting, Mr Zelensky said it was “very important to have Europe’s support for Ukraine maintained at sufficient level… it’s important for co-operation between all the neighbours in Europe to become more meaningful and mutually beneficial"". In his own statement, Mr Orban stressed the need to work together but also said he had raised the idea of a ceasefire to hasten negotiations with Russia.  ""I have asked the president to consider whether... a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations... I am grateful for his frank dialogue and his answers."" Mr Orban also said:  ""My first trip has taken me here because the issue of peace is important not only for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe. This war that you are suffering is deeply impacting European security."" President Zelensky did not publicly respond to those comments. Later, in a post on X, the Ukrainian leader said Mr Orban's visit to Ukraine was a ""clear signal to all of us of the importance of unity in Europe and taking collective steps"". ""We discussed the path to a just, lasting, and fair peace."" Many Ukrainians believe a ceasefire would simply cement Russia’s hold over territory it has taken from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country was open to ""work with everyone and solve problems"". ""This work is difficult and time-consuming, but it eventually yields tangible results,” he told the BBC. “During the visit, President Zelensky had a candid but constructive discussion with Prime Minister Orban about ways to achieve a just peace, not simply a ceasefire or peace talks.” The two leaders also discussed bilateral issues including the 100,000 ethnic Hungarians who reside in Ukraine. Mr Orban said the two countries were determined to put past disagreements behind them, and that he was reassured progress was being made on the rights of the ethnic Hungarians.  He also wished Ukraine ""every success"". The EU opened membership talks for Ukraine the week before Hungary assumed the EU Council Presidency. "
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw00eqqk4dro,How bees could help war-hit families in Ukraine,Scientists develop new beeswax wraps to help families preserve food in war zones.,28 Jun 2024,2024-10-14 18:32:50.644343,Ukraine War,BBC,Ukraine,"Beeswax could be crucial to help preserve food in war zones like Ukraine, according to researchers. UK scientists have been helping beekeepers in the besieged country to develop new wax wrappings for perishable foods amid Russian attacks. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in recent months, causing blackouts, meaning there may be no refrigeration in some areas during the summer. Ukraine is the largest producer of honey in Europe and researchers based in Cardiff have been analysing individual beehives to decide which could offer the best protection.  ""People will know Ukraine is not in a great place at the moment,"" said Professor Les Baille, from Cardiff University. ""As everyone knows, food goes off very quickly if there’s no way of preserving it. ""Using a beeswax wrap that can kill bugs, seems like a natural way of addressing this issue."" The research team have created different ""recipes"", which mix together combinations of ordinary items still likely to be available in war zones, to create wraps which can preserve food. They have been able to test different combinations to come up with some of the most potent for food preservation. ""The magic is in the mixture,"" said Prof Baille. He said ""a piece of cloth or even paper"" is combined with beeswax and other naturally occurring antimicrobial plants, like sage, to form the wraps. ""Beeswax wraps are traditionally used to extend the life of sandwiches, but they can be used for other products as well,"" he added. As part of the effort to help Ukrainians preserve their food for as long as possible, the team at Cardiff University have been working with academics and beekeepers in the country to test beehives around Ukraine to see which are best suited to the task. ""They have lots of beeswax and they have lots of bees,"" said Prof Baille. ""By finding the right wax that has the right properties, you have the chance to extend the life of your food further.  ""That's particularly important when you don’t have refrigerators and you don't have a source of power. He said it would not keep things fresh indefinitely, but could extend the life for a couple of days. Ukrainian counterparts at Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute have been spreading the information from Cardiff University online and across social media, in the hope Ukrainians will be able to try it for themselves this summer. Kharkiv has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks. ""The situation in conflict zones and near the frontline is very hard. ""People there have no electricity or very often there are blackouts in these regions,"" said Dr Yuliia Yudina, from the National University Pharmacy at Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute. She said the power cuts had led to a ""significant"" amount of food waste. ""[The wrap] can be used for bread to keep it fresher, fruit and vegetables to keep them fresher."" Prof Baille and his team of microbiologists hope their work with Ukraine will help others in war zones around the world harness the natural antibiotic properties of honey - which was once used by civilisations like Ancient Greece. ""We've actually had a response from the military in Ukraine, picking up this idea. ""For us, if we can just do a small thing to make this better, from our safe homes, then it’s worth it.""
